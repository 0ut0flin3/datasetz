{"c# - When should I not use the ThreadPool in .Net?": "\n@Eric, I'm going to have to agree with Dean.  Threads are expensive.  You can't assume that your program is the only one running.  When everyone is greedy with resources, the problem multiplies.\n\nI prefer to create my threads manually and control them myself. It keeps the code very easy to understand.\n\nThat's fine when it's appropriate.  If you need a bunch of worker threads, though, all you've done is make your code more complicated.  Now you have to write code to manage them.  If you just used a thread pool, you'd get all the thread management for free.  And the thread pool provided by the language is very likely to be more robust, more efficient, and less buggy than whatever you roll for yourself.\n\nThread t = new Thread(new ThreadStart(DoSomething));  \nt.Start();  \nt.Join();  \n\n\nI hope that you would normally have some additional code in between Start() and Join().  Otherwise, the extra thread is useless, and you're wasting resources for no reason.\n\nPeople are way too afraid of the resources used by threads. I've never seen creating and starting a thread to take more than a millisecond. There is no hard limit on the number of threads you can create. RAM usage is minimal. Once you have a few hundred threads, CPU becomes an issue because of context switches, so at that point you might want to get fancy with your design.\n\nA millisecond is a long time on modern hardware.  That's 3 million cycles on a 3GHz machine.  And again, you aren't the only one creating threads.  Your threads compete for the CPU along with every other program's threads.  If you use not-quite-too-many threads, and so does another program, then together you've used too many threads.\n\nSeriously, don't make life more complex than it needs to be. Don't use the thread pool unless you need something very specific that it offers.\n\nIndeed.  Don't make life more complex.  If your program needs multiple worker threads, don't reinvent the wheel.  Use the thread pool.  That's why it's there.

If you are running on a server then you are going to want to use one of the XML based office generation formats as there are know issues when using Office Automation on a server.\nHowever, if you are working on the client machine then you have a choice of either using Office Automation or using the Office Open XML format (see links below), which is supported by Microsoft Office 2000 and up either natively or through service packs. One draw back to this though is that you might not be able to embed some kinds of graphs or images that you wish to show. \nThe best way to go about things will all depend sightly upon how much time you have to invest in development. If you go the route of Office Automation there are quite a few good tutorials out there that can be found via Google and is fairly simple to learn.

Any instance members are not guaranteed to be thread safe.\"\nThis means that instance members such as TextBox.Text {get; set;} are not reentrant.\nMaking each of those instance members thread safe could introduce a lot of overhead that most applications do not need.  Instead the designers of the .Net framework decided, and I think correctly, that the burden of synchronizing access to forms controls from multiple threads should be put on the programmer.\n[Edit]\nAlthough this question only asks \"why\" here is a link to an article that explains \"how\":\nHow to: Make Thread-Safe Calls to Windows Forms Controls on MSDN\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171728.aspx\n", "c - Send messages to program through command line": "\nIf you were on Windows, I'd tell you to use a hidden window to receive the messages, but since you used ./, I assume you want something Unix-based.\nIn that case, I'd go with a named pipe.  Sun has a tutorial about named pipes that might be useful.\nThe program would probably create the pipe and listen.  You could have a separate command-line script which would open the pipe and just echo its command-line arguments to it.\nYou could modify your program to support the command-line sending instead of using a separate script.  You'd do the same basic thing in that case.  Your program would look at it's command-line arguments, and if applicable, open the pipe to the \"main\" instance of the program, and send the arguments through.\n", "architecture - Interfaces on different logic layers": "\nIf I understand the question correctly, you've created a domain model and you would like to write an object-relational mapper to map between records in your database and your domain objects. However, you're concerned about polluting your domain model with the 'plumbing' code that would be necessary to read and write to your object's fields.\nTaking a step back, you essentially have two choices of where to put your data mapping code - within the domain class itself or in an external mapping class.\nThe first option is often called the Active Record pattern and has the advantage that each object knows how to persist itself and has sufficient access to its internal structure to allow it to perform the mapping without needing to expose non-business related fields.\nE.g\npublic class User\n{\n    private string name;\n    private AccountStatus status;\n\n    private User()\n    {\n    }\n\n    public string Name\n    {\n        get { return name; }\n        set { name = value; }\n    }\n\n    public AccountStatus Status\n    {\n        get { return status; }\n    }\n\n    public void Activate()\n    {\n        status = AccountStatus.Active;\n    }\n\n    public void Suspend()\n    {\n        status = AccountStatus.Suspended;\n    }\n\n    public static User GetById(int id)\n    {\n        User fetchedUser = new User();\n\n        // Lots of database and error-checking code\n        // omitted for clarity\n        // ...\n\n        fetchedUser.name = (string) reader[\"Name\"];\n        fetchedUser.status = (int)reader[\"statusCode\"] == 0 ? AccountStatus.Suspended : AccountStatus.Active;\n\n        return fetchedUser;\n    }\n\n    public static void Save(User user)\n    {\n        // Code to save User's internal structure to database\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\nIn this example, we have an object that represents a User with a Name and an AccountStatus. We don't want to allow the Status to be set directly, perhaps because we want to check that the change is a valid status transition, so we don't have a setter. Fortunately, the mapping code in the GetById and Save static methods have full access to the object's name and status fields.\nThe second option is to have a second class that is responsible for the mapping. This has the advantage of seperating out the different concerns of business logic and persistence which can allow your design to be more testable and flexible. The challenge with this method is how to expose the name and status fields to the external class. Some options are:\n  1. Use reflection (which has no qualms about digging deep into your object's private parts)\n  2. Provide specially-named, public setters (e.g. prefix them with the word 'Private') and hope no one uses them accidentally\n  3. If your language suports it, make the setters internal but grant your data mapper module access. E.g. use the InternalsVisibleToAttribute in .NET 2.0 onwards or friend functions in C++\nFor more information, I'd recommend Martin Fowler's classic book 'Patterns of Enterprise Architecture'\nHowever, as a word of warning, before going down the path of writing your own mappers I'd strongly recommend looking at using a 3rd-party object relational mapper (ORM) tool such as nHibernate or Microsoft's Entity Framework. I've worked on four different projects where, for various reasons, we wrote our own mapper and it is very easy to waste a lot of time maintaining and extending the mapper instead of writing code that provides end user value. I've used nHibernate on one project so far and, although it has quite a steep learning curve initially, the investment you put in early on pays off considerably.\n", "c# - HowTo Disable WebBrowser 'Click Sound' in your app only": "\nconst int FEATURE_DISABLE_NAVIGATION_SOUNDS = 21;\nconst int SET_FEATURE_ON_PROCESS = 0x00000002;\n\n[DllImport(\"urlmon.dll\")]\n[PreserveSig]\n[return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.Error)]\nstatic extern int CoInternetSetFeatureEnabled(int FeatureEntry,\n                                              [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.U4)] int dwFlags,\n                                              bool fEnable);\n\nstatic void DisableClickSounds()\n{\n    CoInternetSetFeatureEnabled(FEATURE_DISABLE_NAVIGATION_SOUNDS,\n                                SET_FEATURE_ON_PROCESS,\n                                true);\n}\n\n", "c# - Is there a \"Set\" data structure in .Net?": "\nHashSet<T> is about the closest you'll get, I think.\n", "Graphical representation of SVN branch/merge activity": "\nCheck this out SvnMapper from Tigris.org\n\n", "How to get PNG transparency working in browsers that don't natively support it?": "\n\nIE PNG Fix 2.0 which supports background-position and -repeat!\n\nAlso paletted 8-bit PNG with full alpha transparency exist, contrary to what Photoshop and GIMP may make you believe, and they degrade better in IE6 \u2013 it just cuts down transparency to 1-bit.

This occurs accidentally when you hold on to references beyond the intended scope.\nYou'll know that you have leaks when you start getting OutOfMemoryExceptions or your memory usage goes up beyond what you'd expect (PerfMon has nice memory counters). \nUnderstanding .NET's memory model is your best way of avoiding it. Specifically, understanding how the garbage collector works and how references work \u2014 again, I refer you to chapter 7 of the e-book. Also, be mindful of common pitfalls, probably the most common being events. If object A is registered to an event on object B, then object A will stick around until object B disappears because B holds a reference to A. The solution is to unregister your events when you're done. \nOf course, a good memory profile will let you see your object graphs and explore the nesting/referencing of your objects to see where references are coming from and what root object is responsible (red-gate ants profile, JetBrains dotMemory, memprofiler are really good choices, or you can use the text-only WinDbg and SOS, but I'd strongly recommend a commercial/visual product unless you're a real guru).\nI believe unmanaged code is subject to its typical memory leaks, except that shared references are managed by the garbage collector. I could be wrong about this last point.\n", "svn - Best Subversion clients for Windows Vista (64bit)": "\nI have been using the 64Bit version of TortoiseSVN for ages and I have never had issues with it on Windows 64Bit or Vista 64Bit.

(These go in your version control system.)  A _version_history_ table, something like\ncreate table VersionHistory (\n    Version int primary key,\n    UpgradeStart datetime not null,\n    UpgradeEnd datetime\n    );\n\ngets a new entry every time an upgrade script runs which corresponds to the new version.\nThis ensures that it's easy to see what version of the database schema exists and that database upgrade scripts are run only once.  Again, these are not database dumps.  Rather, each script represents the changes necessary to move from one version to the next.  They're the script that you apply to your production database to \"upgrade\" it.\nDeveloper Sandbox Synchronization\n\nA script to backup, sanitize, and shrink a production database.  Run this after each upgrade to the production DB.\nA script to restore (and tweak, if necessary) the backup on a developer's workstation.

The gtk_idle_add() call adds a method to be run when the main loop is running and idle, and the FALSE return value from the display_dialog() call means that it's only run once.  After we get the result from the dialog, we quit the main loop. That'll cause the gtk_main() in your main MessageBox() method to return, and you'll be able to access the result from there.\n", "c++ - BerkeleyDB Concurrency": "\nIt depends on what kind of application you are building.

Each migration is numbered, and a table keeps track of your current db version.\nTo migrate up, you run a command called \"db:migrate\" which looks at your version and applies the needed scripts. You can migrate down in a similar way.\nThe migration scripts themselves are kept in a version control system -- whenever you change the database you check in a new script, and any developer can apply it to bring their local db to the latest version.\n", "How does \"Reputation\" work? - Meta Stack Exchange": "\nWhat does Reputation do?\nAs a registered user, your reputation on the site is a part of your identity on the site. It reflects, to an extent, your familiarity with the site, the amount of subject matter expertise you have and the level of respect your peers have for you. It can generally only be gained when other users of the site approve of the content you provide.\nReputation also determines a user\u2019s privileges within the system. As you gain more reputation, the system learns to trust you and bestows new privileges upon you that low-reputation users cannot access.\nAs users gain reputation, they gain abilities and responsibilities. The required reputation can vary slightly between different Stack Exchange sites; see your site\u2019s /privileges page for specifics. Common privilege levels for new sites, public beta sites and \u201cnormal\u201d sites are described here.\nHow can users gain or lose Reputation?\nUsers gain or lose reputation based on the quality of their interactions with the system and other community members. The primary reason for reputation change is voting. Posts that are upvoted increase their authors\u2019 reputation; the reverse is true for posts that are downvoted. Upvotes are more heavily weighted than downvotes.\nPosts that have Community Wiki status are exceptions to the reputation rules; votes and acceptances do not grant reputation; bounties, however, still do.\nYou gain reputation when:\n\n\n\n\nAction\nReputation Change\n\n\n\n\nOne of your posts is upvoted\n+10\n\n\nOne of your answers is accepted by the author\n+15\n\n\nYou accept an answer, not written by you, to a question of yours\n+2\n\n\nA suggested edit of yours is approved\n+2 (up to a total of +1000 per user)\n\n\nOne of your answers is awarded a bounty by the user offering the bounty\n+\u205ffull bounty amount\n\n\nOne of your answers is awarded a bounty automatically\n50% or 100% of the bounty amount (see bounty FAQ for details)\n\n\nYou associate accounts of two or more Stack Exchange network sites, and at least one of those accounts has 200 or more reputation\n+100 on each site (awarded only once per site) (this reputation bonus does not count toward the required 10 reputation to answer protected questions)\n\n\n\nYou lose reputation when:\n\n\n\n\nAction\nReputation Change\n\n\n\n\nOne of your posts is downvoted\n\u22122\n\n\nYou downvote an answer*\n\u22121\n\n\nOne of your accepted answers loses accepted status (i.e. unaccepted)\n\u221215\n\n\nYou unaccept an answer written by someone else to one of your own questions\n\u22122\n\n\nYou place a bounty on a question\n\u2212\u205ffull bounty amount\n\n\nOne of your posts is deleted after receiving enough spam or rude or abusive flags (formerly known as offensive flags)\n\u2212100\n\n\n\n\n* Downvoting a Community Wiki answer does not deduct reputation from the voter.\nAdditionally:\n\nAll users start with one reputation point.\n\nNo user's reputation may drop below one point; if an action would cause a user's reputation to drop below one point, that user only loses enough reputation to drop to one point (source), and the remaining penalty or loss is waived.\n\nYou can earn a maximum of +200 reputation from upvotes and suggested edits in any given day. Bounties and the bonuses for accepting and accepted answers are counted separately (source). Reputation \u201clost\u201d from the reputation cap is not awarded on following days. Additionally, if you hit the cap and later lose reputation, previous votes do not fill in the difference, although later votes will push it to the cap again.\n\nYou can earn up to a maximum of 1,000 reputation overall from suggested edits. If you hit the cap, subsequent approved edit suggestions will not earn you any reputation, and will not count toward your reputation even if you later lose the earned reputation from earlier approved suggestions (they are overridden to rejections, the posts are deleted, or reviewers remove their accounts).\n\nIf a vote is removed, everyone's reputation is recalculated as if the vote was never cast.\n\nIf a vote is cast before a post becomes Community Wiki, but is removed after the post becomes CW, the removal does not affect anyone's reputation (source).\n\nBefore May 2011, downvoting questions cost the downvoter one reputation point (source). (Since May 2011, there is no cost for downvoting questions.)\n\nDeleting and undeleting posts may reverse reputation effects as well, if these posts have votes. Actions previously taken on deleted posts cease to affect reputation within five minutes (source), unless the post meets both the following criteria (in which case the reputation effects will be permanent) (source):\n\nThe post had a score of at least +3\nThe post was visible (i.e. not deleted) on the site at a moment at least 60 days after it was originally created\n\nThis includes reputation earned from approved suggested edits on deleted posts.\n\nAccepting your own answer does not gain you any reputation.\n\nVoting reversal as a result of serial voting will return lost or gained reputation.\n\nIf a user who voted for one or more of your posts or who approved any of your suggested edits gets their account deleted, it may cause your reputation to change as if their votes were never cast. If this changes your reputation, the change will be shown as \"User was removed\".\n\nThis does not happen if the user has cast a lot of votes, such that removing all of them would be highly disruptive to a lot of users. In that case, the account's deletion will be held up so that staff can review the user's voting record. If, upon review, employees come across some reason that votes should not be preserved (e.g. the user was involved in voting fraud), they'll be removed as normal; otherwise, they will be preserved. If you see a \"User was removed\" change in your history, it either means that the user hadn't cast enough votes to trigger such a review, or staff made the explicit decision not to preserve the votes.\n\n\nIf one of your suggested edits is approved and earns you reputation, then that edit is subsequently overridden to a rejection by the author or a moderator, you will lose that reputation.\n\nA script that runs occasionally fixes inconsistencies in reputation, which may be caused by bugs/glitches not mentioned here. This can change your reputation in certain cases.\n\nUpvoted comments do not affect reputation.\n\n\nWhen everyone is at 1, where does the reputation start?\nThere are four ways a new user can earn their first bit of reputation:\n\nMake a post that gets upvotes. No reputation is required to make posts, and the rep loss from downvotes is waived if it causes your reputation to drop below 1.\nUsers come from another site in the network where they start with 100 reputation (if they have a linked account with 200+ reputation) (this doesn't give the ability to answer protected questions)\nUsers have their answers accepted or are the ones accepting answers from other users (+15 and +2 respectively)\nSuggested edits are approved (the original poster has a binding vote on suggested edits if they are not yet approved or even rejected)\n\n", "PHP Session Security": "\nThere are a couple of things to do in order to keep your session secure:\n\nUse SSL when authenticating users or performing sensitive operations.\nRegenerate the session id whenever the security level changes (such as logging in).

Here is a good quick discussion of how to use the API.\nWhat I like: you can handle the parsing in a for loop rather than using callbacks.

Thus, if object is actually a List<String>, there will be no ClassCastException at run-time except until an item is accessed from the list that doesn't match the generic type defined in the variable.  \nThis can cause further complications if items are added to the list, with this incorrect generic type information.  Any code still holding a reference to the list but with the correct generic type information will now have an inconsistent list.  \nTo remove the warning, try:\nList<?> list = (List<?>) object;\n\nHowever, note that you will not be able to use certain methods such as add because the compiler doesn't know if you are trying to add an object of incorrect type.

Later, if you try to remove happyThing.view, and instead put in there newThing.view, IT DOES NOT WORK - AND THAT'S THAT. The machine will never rotate the view to landscape. There is no trick fix, even Apple cannot make it work.

The sections below will deal with patterns for sound practical auth, and how to avoid the most common security pitfalls.\nTo HTTPS or not to HTTPS?\nUnless the connection is already secure (that is, tunneled through HTTPS using SSL/TLS), your login form values will be sent in cleartext, which allows anyone eavesdropping on the line between browser and web server will be able to read logins as they pass through. This type of wiretapping is done routinely by governments, but in general, we won't address 'owned' wires other than to say this: Just use HTTPS.\nIn essence, the only practical way to protect against wiretapping/packet sniffing during login is by using HTTPS or another certificate-based encryption scheme (for example, TLS) or a proven & tested challenge-response scheme (for example, the Diffie-Hellman-based SRP). Any other method can be easily circumvented by an eavesdropping attacker.\nOf course, if you are willing to get a little bit impractical, you could also employ some form of two-factor authentication scheme (e.g. the Google Authenticator app, a physical 'cold war style' codebook, or an RSA key generator dongle). If applied correctly, this could work even with an unsecured connection, but it's hard to imagine that a dev would be willing to implement two-factor auth but not SSL.\n(Do not) Roll-your-own JavaScript encryption/hashing\nGiven the perceived (though now avoidable) cost and technical difficulty of setting up an SSL certificate on your website, some developers are tempted to roll their own in-browser hashing or encryption schemes in order to avoid passing cleartext logins over an unsecured wire.\nWhile this is a noble thought, it is essentially useless (and can be a security flaw) unless it is combined with one of the above - that is, either securing the line with strong encryption or using a tried-and-tested challenge-response mechanism (if you don't know what that is, just know that it is one of the most difficult to prove, most difficult to design, and most difficult to implement concepts in digital security).\nWhile it is true that hashing the password can be effective against password disclosure, it is vulnerable to replay attacks, Man-In-The-Middle attacks / hijackings (if an attacker can inject a few bytes into your unsecured HTML page before it reaches your browser, they can simply comment out the hashing in the JavaScript), or brute-force attacks (since you are handing the attacker both username, salt and hashed password).\nCAPTCHAS against humanity\nCAPTCHA is meant to thwart one specific category of attack: automated dictionary/brute force trial-and-error with no human operator. There is no doubt that this is a real threat, however, there are ways of dealing with it seamlessly that don't require a CAPTCHA, specifically properly designed server-side login throttling schemes - we'll discuss those later.\nKnow that CAPTCHA implementations are not created alike; they often aren't human-solvable, most of them are actually ineffective against bots, all of them are ineffective against cheap third-world labor (according to OWASP, the current sweatshop rate is $12 per 500 tests), and some implementations may be technically illegal in some countries (see OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet). If you must use a CAPTCHA, use Google's reCAPTCHA, since it is OCR-hard by definition (since it uses already OCR-misclassified book scans) and tries very hard to be user-friendly.\nPersonally, I tend to find CAPTCHAS annoying, and use them only as a last resort when a user has failed to log in a number of times and throttling delays are maxed out. This will happen rarely enough to be acceptable, and it strengthens the system as a whole.\nStoring Passwords / Verifying logins\nThis may finally be common knowledge after all the highly-publicized hacks and user data leaks we've seen in recent years, but it has to be said: Do not store passwords in cleartext in your database. User databases are routinely hacked, leaked or gleaned through SQL injection, and if you are storing raw, plaintext passwords, that is instant game over for your login security.\nSo if you can't store the password, how do you check that the login+password combination POSTed from the login form is correct? The answer is hashing using a key derivation function. Whenever a new user is created or a password is changed, you take the password and run it through a KDF, such as Argon2, bcrypt, scrypt or PBKDF2, turning the cleartext password (\"correcthorsebatterystaple\") into a long, random-looking string, which is a lot safer to store in your database. To verify a login, you run the same hash function on the entered password, this time passing in the salt and compare the resulting hash string to the value stored in your database. Argon2, bcrypt and scrypt store the salt with the hash already. Check out this article on sec.stackexchange for more detailed information.\nThe reason a salt is used is that hashing in itself is not sufficient -- you'll want to add a so-called 'salt' to protect the hash against rainbow tables. A salt effectively prevents two passwords that exactly match from being stored as the same hash value, preventing the whole database being scanned in one run if an attacker is executing a password guessing attack.\nA cryptographic hash should not be used for password storage because user-selected passwords are not strong enough (i.e. do not usually contain enough entropy) and a password guessing attack could be completed in a relatively short time by an attacker with access to the hashes. This is why KDFs are used - these effectively \"stretch the key\", which means that every password guess an attacker makes causes multiple repetitions of the hash algorithm, for example 10,000 times, which causes the attacker to guess the password 10,000 times slower.\nSession data - \"You are logged in as Spiderman69\"\nOnce the server has verified the login and password against your user database and found a match, the system needs a way to remember that the browser has been authenticated. This fact should only ever be stored server side in the session data.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with session data, here's how it works: A single randomly-generated string is stored in an expiring cookie and used to reference a collection of data - the session data - which is stored on the server. If you are using an MVC framework, this is undoubtedly handled already.\n\nIf at all possible, make sure the session cookie has the secure and HTTP Only flags set when sent to the browser. The HttpOnly flag provides some protection against the cookie being read through XSS attack. The secure flag ensures that the cookie is only sent back via HTTPS, and therefore protects against network sniffing attacks. The value of the cookie should not be predictable. Where a cookie referencing a non-existent session is presented, its value should be replaced immediately to prevent session fixation.\nSession state can also be maintained on the client side. This is achieved by using techniques like JWT (JSON Web Token).\nPART II: How To Remain Logged In - The Infamous \"Remember Me\" Checkbox\nPersistent Login Cookies (\"remember me\" functionality) are a danger zone; on the one hand, they are entirely as safe as conventional logins when users understand how to handle them; and on the other hand, they are an enormous security risk in the hands of careless users, who may use them on public computers and forget to log out, and who may not know what browser cookies are or how to delete them.\nPersonally, I like persistent logins for the websites I visit on a regular basis, but I know how to handle them safely. If you are positive that your users know the same, you can use persistent logins with a clean conscience. If not - well, then you may subscribe to the philosophy that users who are careless with their login credentials brought it upon themselves if they get hacked. It's not like we go to our user's houses and tear off all those facepalm-inducing Post-It notes with passwords they have lined up on the edge of their monitors, either.\nOf course, some systems can't afford to have any accounts hacked; for such systems, there is no way you can justify having persistent logins.\nIf you DO decide to implement persistent login cookies, this is how you do it:\n\nFirst, take some time to read Paragon Initiative's article on the subject. You'll need to get a bunch of elements right, and the article does a great job of explaining each.\n\nAnd just to reiterate one of the most common pitfalls, DO NOT STORE THE PERSISTENT LOGIN COOKIE (TOKEN) IN YOUR DATABASE, ONLY A HASH OF IT! The login token is Password Equivalent, so if an attacker got their hands on your database, they could use the tokens to log in to any account, just as if they were cleartext login-password combinations. Therefore, use hashing (according to https://security.stackexchange.com/a/63438/5002 a weak hash will do just fine for this purpose) when storing persistent login tokens.\n\n\nPART III: Using Secret Questions\nDon't implement 'secret questions'. The 'secret questions' feature is a security anti-pattern. Read the paper from link number 4 from the MUST-READ list. You can ask Sarah Palin about that one, after her Yahoo! email account got hacked during a previous presidential campaign because the answer to her security question was... \"Wasilla High School\"!\nEven with user-specified questions, it is highly likely that most users will choose either:\n\nA 'standard' secret question like mother's maiden name or favorite pet\n\nA simple piece of trivia that anyone could lift from their blog, LinkedIn profile, or similar\n\nAny question that is easier to answer than guessing their password. Which, for any decent password, is every question you can imagine\n\n\nIn conclusion, security questions are inherently insecure in virtually all their forms and variations, and should not be employed in an authentication scheme for any reason.\nThe true reason why security questions even exist in the wild is that they conveniently save the cost of a few support calls from users who can't access their email to get to a reactivation code. This at the expense of security and Sarah Palin's reputation. Worth it? Probably not.\nPART IV: Forgotten Password Functionality\nI already mentioned why you should never use security questions for handling forgotten/lost user passwords; it also goes without saying that you should never e-mail users their actual passwords. There are at least two more all-too-common pitfalls to avoid in this field:\n\nDon't reset a forgotten password to an autogenerated strong password - such passwords are notoriously hard to remember, which means the user must either change it or write it down - say, on a bright yellow Post-It on the edge of their monitor. Instead of setting a new password, just let users pick a new one right away - which is what they want to do anyway. (An exception to this might be if the users are universally using a password manager to store/manage passwords that would normally be impossible to remember without writing it down).\n\nAlways hash the lost password code/token in the database. AGAIN, this code is another example of a Password Equivalent, so it MUST be hashed in case an attacker got their hands on your database. When a lost password code is requested, send the plaintext code to the user's email address, then hash it, save the hash in your database -- and throw away the original. Just like a password or a persistent login token.\n\n\nA final note: always make sure your interface for entering the 'lost password code' is at least as secure as your login form itself, or an attacker will simply use this to gain access instead. Making sure you generate very long 'lost password codes' (for example, 16 case-sensitive alphanumeric characters) is a good start, but consider adding the same throttling scheme that you do for the login form itself.\nPART V: Checking Password Strength\nFirst, you'll want to read this small article for a reality check: The 500 most common passwords\nOkay, so maybe the list isn't the canonical list of most common passwords on any system anywhere ever, but it's a good indication of how poorly people will choose their passwords when there is no enforced policy in place. Plus, the list looks frighteningly close to home when you compare it to publicly available analyses of recently stolen passwords.\nSo: With no minimum password strength requirements, 2% of users use one of the top 20 most common passwords. Meaning: if an attacker gets just 20 attempts, 1 in 50 accounts on your website will be crackable.\nThwarting this requires calculating the entropy of a password and then applying a threshold.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-63 has a set of very good suggestions.  That, when combined with a dictionary and keyboard layout analysis (for example, 'qwertyuiop' is a bad password), can reject 99% of all poorly selected passwords at a level of 18 bits of entropy.  Simply calculating password strength and showing a visual strength meter to a user is good, but insufficient.  Unless it is enforced, a lot of users will most likely ignore it.\nAnd for a refreshing take on user-friendliness of high-entropy passwords, Randall Munroe's Password Strength xkcd is highly recommended.\nUtilize Troy Hunt's Have I Been Pwned API to check users passwords against passwords compromised in public data breaches.\nPART VI: Much More - Or: Preventing Rapid-Fire Login Attempts\nFirst, have a look at the numbers: Password Recovery Speeds - How long will your password stand up\nIf you don't have the time to look through the tables in that link, here's the list of them:\n\nIt takes virtually no time to crack a weak password, even if you're cracking it with an abacus\n\nIt takes virtually no time to crack an alphanumeric 9-character password if it is case insensitive\n\nIt takes virtually no time to crack an intricate, symbols-and-letters-and-numbers, upper-and-lowercase password if it is less than 8 characters long (a desktop PC can search the entire keyspace up to 7 characters in a matter of days or even hours)\n\nIt would, however, take an inordinate amount of time to crack even a 6-character password, if you were limited to one attempt per second!\n\n\nSo what can we learn from these numbers? Well, lots, but we can focus on the most important part: the fact that preventing large numbers of rapid-fire successive login attempts (ie. the brute force attack) really isn't that difficult. But preventing it right isn't as easy as it seems.\nGenerally speaking, you have three choices that are all effective against brute-force attacks (and dictionary attacks, but since you are already employing a strong passwords policy, they shouldn't be an issue):\n\nPresent a CAPTCHA after N failed attempts (annoying as hell and often ineffective -- but I'm repeating myself here)\n\nLocking accounts and requiring email verification after N failed attempts (this is a DoS attack waiting to happen)\n\nAnd finally, login throttling: that is, setting a time delay between attempts after N failed attempts (yes, DoS attacks are still possible, but at least they are far less likely and a lot more complicated to pull off).\n\n\nBest practice #1: A short time delay that increases with the number of failed attempts, like:\n\n1 failed attempt = no delay\n2 failed attempts = 2 sec delay\n3 failed attempts = 4 sec delay\n4 failed attempts = 8 sec delay\n5 failed attempts = 16 sec delay\netc.\n\nDoS attacking this scheme would be very impractical, since the resulting lockout time is slightly larger than the sum of the previous lockout times.\n\nTo clarify: The delay is not a delay before returning the response to the browser. It is more like a timeout or refractory period during which login attempts to a specific account or from a specific IP address will not be accepted or evaluated at all. That is, correct credentials will not return in a successful login, and incorrect credentials will not trigger a delay increase.\n\nBest practice #2: A medium length time delay that goes into effect after N failed attempts, like:\n\n1-4 failed attempts = no delay\n5 failed attempts = 15-30 min delay\n\nDoS attacking this scheme would be quite impractical, but certainly doable. Also, it might be relevant to note that such a long delay can be very annoying for a legitimate user. Forgetful users will dislike you.\nBest practice #3: Combining the two approaches - either a fixed, short time delay that goes into effect after N failed attempts, like:\n\n1-4 failed attempts = no delay\n5+ failed attempts = 20 sec delay\n\nOr, an increasing delay with a fixed upper bound, like:\n\n1 failed attempt = 5 sec delay\n2 failed attempts = 15 sec delay\n3+ failed attempts = 45 sec delay\n\nThis final scheme was taken from the OWASP best-practices suggestions (link 1 from the MUST-READ list) and should be considered best practice, even if it is admittedly on the restrictive side.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, however, I would say: the stronger your password policy is, the less you have to bug users with delays. If you require strong (case-sensitive alphanumerics + required numbers and symbols) 9+ character passwords, you could give the users 2-4 non-delayed password attempts before activating the throttling.\n\nDoS attacking this final login throttling scheme would be very impractical. And as a final touch, always allow persistent (cookie) logins (and/or a CAPTCHA-verified login form) to pass through, so legitimate users won't even be delayed while the attack is in progress. That way, the very impractical DoS attack becomes an extremely impractical attack.\nAdditionally, it makes sense to do more aggressive throttling on admin accounts, since those are the most attractive entry points\nPART VII: Distributed Brute Force Attacks\nJust as an aside, more advanced attackers will try to circumvent login throttling by 'spreading their activities':\n\nDistributing the attempts on a botnet to prevent IP address flagging\n\nRather than picking one user and trying the 50.000 most common passwords (which they can't, because of our throttling), they will pick THE most common password and try it against 50.000 users instead. That way, not only do they get around maximum-attempts measures like CAPTCHAs and login throttling, their chance of success increases as well, since the number 1 most common password is far more likely than number 49.995\n\nSpacing the login requests for each user account, say, 30 seconds apart, to sneak under the radar\n\n\nHere, the best practice would be logging the number of failed logins, system-wide, and using a running average of your site's bad-login frequency as the basis for an upper limit that you then impose on all users.\nToo abstract? Let me rephrase:\nSay your site has had an average of 120 bad logins per day over the past 3 months. Using that (running average), your system might set the global limit to 3 times that -- ie. 360 failed attempts over a 24 hour period. Then, if the total number of failed attempts across all accounts exceeds that number within one day (or even better, monitor the rate of acceleration and trigger on a calculated threshold), it activates system-wide login throttling - meaning short delays for ALL users (still, with the exception of cookie logins and/or backup CAPTCHA logins).\nI also posted a question with more details and a really good discussion of how to avoid tricky pitfals in fending off distributed brute force attacks\nPART VIII: Two-Factor Authentication and Authentication Providers\nCredentials can be compromised, whether by exploits, passwords being written down and lost, laptops with keys being stolen, or users entering logins into phishing sites.  Logins can be further protected with two-factor authentication, which uses out-of-band factors such as single-use codes received from a phone call, SMS message, app, or dongle. Several providers offer two-factor authentication services.\nAuthentication can be completely delegated to a single-sign-on service, where another provider handles collecting credentials. This pushes the problem to a trusted third party. Google and Twitter both provide standards-based SSO services, while Facebook provides a similar proprietary solution.\nMUST-READ LINKS About Web Authentication\n\nOWASP Guide To Authentication / OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet\nDos and Don\u2019ts of Client Authentication on the Web (very readable MIT research paper)\nWikipedia: HTTP cookie\nPersonal knowledge questions for fallback authentication: Security questions in the era of Facebook (very readable Berkeley research paper)\n\n", "resources - What is the single most influential book every programmer should read?": "\n\nCode Complete (2nd edition) by Steve McConnell\nThe Pragmatic Programmer\nStructure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\nThe C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie\nIntroduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest & Stein\nDesign Patterns by the Gang of Four\nRefactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code\nThe Mythical Man Month\nThe Art of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth\nCompilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools by Alfred V.

An integer (just like any other value types) can be boxed (\"wrapped\") into an object. \n\nThe differences between objects and primitives are somewhat beyond the scope of this question, but to summarize: \nObjects provide facilities for polymorphism, are passed by reference (or more accurately have references passed by value), and are allocated from the heap.

Rainbow table crackers like Ophcrack use space to attack passwords; incremental crackers like John the Ripper, Crack, and LC5 work with time: statistics and compute.\nThe password attack game is scored in time taken to crack password X. With rainbow tables, that time depends on how big your table needs to be and how fast you can search it. With incremental crackers, the time depends on how fast you can make the password hash function run.\nThe better you can optimize your password hash function, the faster your password hash function gets, the weaker your scheme is. MD5 and SHA1, even conventional block ciphers like DES, are designed to be fast. MD5, SHA1, and DES are weak password hashes. On modern CPUs, raw crypto building blocks like DES and MD5 can be bitsliced, vectorized, and parallelized to make password searches lightning fast. Game-over FPGA implementations cost only hundreds of dollars. \n\n", "Using 'in' to match an attribute of Python objects in an array": "\nUsing a list comprehension would build a temporary list, which could eat all your memory if the sequence being searched is large.

(I get tired of rewriting the same create/update view logic anytime I need to tweak something Django's generic views don't quite allow).\nI've posted some code at djangosnippets.org.\nThe only real downside I see is the proliferation of internal method calls, which may impact performance somewhat.

After having used them extensively on a couple of projects, I feel they tend to lead to code that is satisfyingly DRY to write, but very hard to read and maintain later, because functionality is spread across so many different places, and subclasses are so dependent on every implementation detail of the superclasses and mixins.

In other words, the groupby iterator itself returns iterators.\nHere's an example of that, using clearer variable names:\nfrom itertools import groupby\n\nthings = [(\"animal\", \"bear\"), (\"animal\", \"duck\"), (\"plant\", \"cactus\"), (\"vehicle\", \"speed boat\"), (\"vehicle\", \"school bus\")]\n\nfor key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):\n    for thing in group:\n        print(\"A %s is a %s.\" % (thing[1], key))\n    print(\"\")\n    \n\nThis will give you the output:\n\nA bear is a animal.\nA duck is a animal.\nA cactus is a plant.\nA speed boat is a vehicle.\nA school bus is a vehicle.\n\nIn this example, things is a list of tuples where the first item in each tuple is the group the second item belongs to.\nThe groupby() function takes two arguments: (1) the data to group and (2) the function to group it with.\nHere, lambda x: x[0] tells groupby() to use the first item in each tuple as the grouping key.\nIn the above for statement, groupby returns three (key, group iterator) pairs - once for each unique key. You can use the returned iterator to iterate over each individual item in that group.\nHere's a slightly different example with the same data, using a list comprehension:\nfor key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):\n    listOfThings = \" and \".join([thing[1] for thing in group])\n    print(key + \"s:  \" + listOfThings + \".\")\n\nThis will give you the output:\n\nanimals: bear and duck.\nplants: cactus.\nvehicles: speed boat and school bus.\n\n", "asp classic - ASP, need to use SFTP": "\nIf you have the ability to use WScript.Shell then you can just execute pscp.exe from the Putty package.

But is also not worse. It's different.\nThe key difference is that it is decentralized. Imagine you are a developer on the road, you develop on your laptop and you want to have source control so that you can go back 3 hours.\nWith Subversion, you have a Problem: The SVN Repository may be in a location you can't reach (in your company, and you don't have internet at the moment), you cannot commit. If you want to make a copy of your code, you have to literally copy/paste it.\nWith Git, you do not have this problem. Your local copy is a repository, and you can commit to it and get all benefits of source control. When you regain connectivity to the main repository, you can commit against it.\nThis looks good at first, but just keep in mind the added complexity to this approach.\nGit seems to be the \"new, shiny, cool\" thing. It's by no means bad (there is a reason Linus wrote it for the Linux Kernel development after all), but I feel that many people jump on the \"Distributed Source Control\" train just because it's new and is written by Linus Torvalds, without actually knowing why/if it's better.\nSubversion has Problems, but so does Git, Mercurial, CVS, TFS or whatever.\nEdit: So this answer is now a year old and still generates many upvotes, so I thought I'll add some more explanations. In the last year since writing this, Git has gained a lot of momentum and support, particularly since sites like GitHub really took off. I'm using both Git and Subversion nowadays and I'd like to share some personal insight.\nFirst of all, Git can be really confusing at first when working decentralized. What is a remote? and How to properly set up the initial repository? are two questions that come up at the beginning, especially compared to SVN's simple \"svnadmin create\", Git's \"git init\" can take the parameters --bare and --shared which seems to be the \"proper\" way to set up a centralized repository. There are reasons for this, but it adds complexity. The documentation of the \"checkout\" command is very confusing to people changing over - the \"proper\" way seems to be \"git clone\", while \"git checkout\" seems to switch branches.\nGit REALLY shines when you are decentralized. I have a server at home and a Laptop on the road, and SVN simply doesn't work well here. With SVN, I can't have local source control if I'm not connected to the repository (Yes, I know about SVK or about ways to copy the repo). With Git, that's the default mode anyway. It's an extra command though (git commit commits locally, whereas git push origin master pushes the master branch to the remote named \"origin\").\nAs said above: Git adds complexity. Two modes of creating repositories, checkout vs. clone, commit vs. push... You have to know which commands work locally and which work with \"the server\" (I'm assuming most people still like a central \"master-repository\").\nAlso, the tooling is still insufficient, at least on Windows. Yes, there is a Visual Studio AddIn, but I still use git bash with msysgit.\nSVN has the advantage that it's MUCH simpler to learn: There is your repository, all changes to towards it, if you know how to create, commit and checkout and you're ready to go and can pickup stuff like branching, update etc. later on.\nGit has the advantage that it's MUCH better suited if some developers are not always connected to the master repository. Also, it's much faster than SVN. And from what I hear, branching and merging support is a lot better (which is to be expected, as these are the core reasons it was written).\nThis also explains why it gains so much buzz on the Internet, as Git is perfectly suited for Open Source projects: Just Fork it, commit your changes to your own Fork, and then ask the original project maintainer to pull your changes. With Git, this just works. Really, try it on Github, it's magic.\nWhat I also see are Git-SVN Bridges: The central repository is a Subversion repo, but developers locally work with Git and the bridge then pushes their changes to SVN.\nBut even with this lengthy addition, I still stand by my core message: Git is not better or worse, it's just different. If you have the need for \"Offline Source Control\" and the willingness to spend some extra time learning it, it's fantastic. But if you have a strictly centralized Source Control and/or are struggling to introduce Source Control in the first place because your co-workers are not interested, then the simplicity and excellent tooling (at least on Windows) of SVN shine.\n", "Are PHP Variables passed by value or by reference?": "\nIt's by value according to the PHP Documentation.\n\nBy default, function arguments are passed by value (so that if the value of the argument within the function is changed, it does not get changed outside of the function).

The default character set on Windows XP (English) is Cp1252. On the web, you don't know what a browser will send you (though hopefully your container will handle most of this). And don't be surprised when there are bugs in whatever implementation you are using. Character sets can have interesting interactions with filenames when they move to between machines.\nTranslating Strings\nTranslators are, generally speaking, not coders. If you send a source file to a translator, they will break it. Strings should be extracted to resource files (e.g. properties files in Java or resource DLLs in Visual C++). Translators should be given files that are difficult to break and tools that don't let them break them.\nTranslators do not know where strings come from in a product. It is difficult to translate a string without context. If you do not provide guidance, the quality of the translation will suffer.\nWhile on the subject of context, you may see the same string \"foo\" crop up in multiple times and think it would be more efficient to have all instances in the UI point to the same resource. This is a bad idea. Words may be very context-sensitive in some languages.\nTranslating strings costs money. If you release a new version of a product, it makes sense to recover the old versions. Have tools to recover strings from your old resource files.\nString concatenation and manual manipulation of strings should be minimized. Use the format functions where applicable.\nTranslators need to be able to modify hotkeys. Ctrl+P is print in English; the Germans use Ctrl+D.\nIf you have a translation process that requires someone to manually cut and paste strings at any time, you are asking for trouble.\nDates, Times, Calendars, Currency, Number Formats, Time Zones\nThese can all vary from country to country. A comma may be used to denote decimal places. Times may be in 24hour notation. Not everyone uses the Gregorian calendar. You need to be unambiguous, too. If you take care to display dates as MM/DD/YYYY for the USA and DD/MM/YYYY for the UK on your website, the dates are ambiguous unless the user knows you've done it.\nEspecially Currency\nThe Locale functions provided in the class libraries will give you the local currency symbol, but you can't just stick a pound (sterling) or euro symbol in front of a value that gives a price in dollars.\nUser Interfaces\nLayout should be dynamic. Not only are strings likely to double in length on translation, the entire UI may need to be inverted (Hebrew; Arabic) so that the controls run from right to left. And that is before we get to Asia.\nTesting Prior To Translation\n\nUse static analysis of your code to locate problems. At a bare minimum, leverage the tools built into your IDE. (Eclipse users can go to Window > Preferences > Java > Compiler > Errors/Warnings and check for non-externalised strings.)\nSmoke test by simulating translation. It isn't difficult to parse a resource file and replace strings with a pseudo-translated version that doubles the length and inserts funky characters. You don't have to speak a language to use a foreign operating system. Modern systems should let you log in as a foreign user with translated strings and foreign locale. If you are familiar with your OS, you can figure out what does what without knowing a single word of the language.\nKeyboard maps and character set references are very useful.\nVirtualisation would be very useful here.\n\nNon-technical Issues\nSometimes you have to be sensitive to cultural differences (offence or incomprehension may result). A mistake you often see is the use of flags as a visual cue choosing a website language or geography. Unless you want your software to declare sides in global politics, this is a bad idea. If you were French and offered the option for English with St. George's flag (the flag of England is a red cross on a white field), this might result in confusion for many English speakers - assume similar issues will arise with foreign languages and countries. Icons need to be vetted for cultural relevance. What does a thumbs-up or a green tick mean? Language should be relatively neutral - addressing users in a particular manner may be acceptable in one region, but considered rude in another.\nResources\nC++ and Java programmers may find the ICU website useful: http://www.icu-project.org/\n", "html - How to break word after special character like Hyphens (-)": "\nReplace your hyphens with this:\n&shy;\n\nIt's called a \"soft\" hyphen.\n\n\ndiv {\r\n  width: 150px;\r\n}\n<div>\r\n  12333&shy;2333&shy;233&shy;23339392&shy;332332323\r\n</div>\n\n\n\n", "Client collation and SQL Server 2005": "\nAll editions of SQL Server 2000/2005/2008 support having multiple databases, each using their own collation sequence.

These blocks are accessed in their entirety, making them the atomic disk access operation. Disk blocks are structured in much the same way as linked lists; both contain a section for data, a pointer to the location of the next node (or block), and both need not be stored contiguously.\nDue to the fact that a number of records can only be sorted on one field, we can state that searching on a field that isn\u2019t sorted requires a Linear Search which requires (N+1)/2 block accesses (on average), where N is the number of blocks that the table spans. If that field is a non-key field (i.e. doesn\u2019t contain unique entries) then the entire tablespace must be searched at N block accesses.\nWhereas with a sorted field, a Binary Search may be used, which has log2 N block accesses. Also since the data is sorted given a non-key field, the rest of the table doesn\u2019t need to be searched for duplicate values, once a higher value is found. Thus the performance increase is substantial.\nWhat is indexing?\nIndexing is a way of sorting a number of records on multiple fields. Creating an index on a field in a table creates another data structure which holds the field value, and a pointer to the record it relates to. This index structure is then sorted, allowing Binary Searches to be performed on it.\nThe downside to indexing is that these indices require additional space on the disk since the indices are stored together in a table using the MyISAM engine, this file can quickly reach the size limits of the underlying file system if many fields within the same table are indexed.\nHow does it work?\nFirstly, let\u2019s outline a sample database table schema;\n\nField name       Data type      Size on disk\nid (Primary key) Unsigned INT   4 bytes\nfirstName        Char(50)       50 bytes\nlastName         Char(50)       50 bytes\nemailAddress     Char(100)      100 bytes\n\nNote: char was used in place of varchar to allow for an accurate size on disk value.\nThis sample database contains five million rows and is unindexed. The performance of several queries will now be analyzed. These are a query using the id (a sorted key field) and one using the firstName (a non-key unsorted field).\nExample 1 - sorted vs unsorted fields\nGiven our sample database of r = 5,000,000 records of a fixed size giving a record length of R = 204 bytes and they are stored in a table using the MyISAM engine which is using the default block size B = 1,024 bytes. The blocking factor of the table would be bfr = (B/R) = 1024/204 = 5 records per disk block. The total number of blocks required to hold the table is N = (r/bfr) = 5000000/5 = 1,000,000 blocks.\nA linear search on the id field would require an average of N/2 = 500,000 block accesses to find a value, given that the id field is a key field. But since the id field is also sorted, a binary search can be conducted requiring an average of log2 1000000 = 19.93 = 20 block accesses. Instantly we can see this is a drastic improvement.\nNow the firstName field is neither sorted nor a key field, so a binary search is impossible, nor are the values unique, and thus the table will require searching to the end for an exact N = 1,000,000 block accesses. It is this situation that indexing aims to correct.\nGiven that an index record contains only the indexed field and a pointer to the original record, it stands to reason that it will be smaller than the multi-field record that it points to. So the index itself requires fewer disk blocks than the original table, which therefore requires fewer block accesses to iterate through. The schema for an index on the firstName field is outlined below;\n\nField name       Data type      Size on disk\nfirstName        Char(50)       50 bytes\n(record pointer) Special        4 bytes\n\nNote: Pointers in MySQL are 2, 3, 4 or 5 bytes in length depending on the size of the table.\nExample 2  - indexing\nGiven our sample database of r = 5,000,000 records with an index record length of R = 54 bytes and using the default block size B = 1,024 bytes. The blocking factor of the index would be bfr = (B/R) = 1024/54 = 18 records per disk block. The total number of blocks required to hold the index is N = (r/bfr) = 5000000/18 = 277,778 blocks.\nNow a search using the firstName field can utilize the index to increase performance. This allows for a binary search of the index with an average of log2 277778 = 18.08 = 19 block accesses. To find the address of the actual record, which requires a further block access to read, bringing the total to 19 + 1 = 20 block accesses, a far cry from the 1,000,000 block accesses required to find a firstName match in the non-indexed table.\nWhen should it be used?\nGiven that creating an index requires additional disk space (277,778 blocks extra from the above example, a ~28% increase), and that too many indices can cause issues arising from the file systems size limits, careful thought must be used to select the correct fields to index.\nSince indices are only used to speed up the searching for a matching field within the records, it stands to reason that indexing fields used only for output would be simply a waste of disk space and processing time when doing an insert or delete operation, and thus should be avoided. Also given the nature of a binary search, the cardinality or uniqueness of the data is important. Indexing on a field with a cardinality of 2 would split the data in half, whereas a cardinality of 1,000 would return approximately 1,000 records. With such a low cardinality the effectiveness is reduced to a linear sort, and the query optimizer will avoid using the index if the cardinality is less than 30% of the record number, effectively making the index a waste of space.\n", "language agnostic - Windows Help files - what are the options?": "\nHTML would be the next best choice, ONLY IF you would serve them from a public web server.

The number of records don't matter.\nIn my experience the biggest problem that you are going to run in to is not size, but the number of queries you can handle at a time.  Most likely you are going to have to move to a master/slave configuration so that the read queries can run against the slaves and the write queries run against the master.  However if you are not ready for this yet, you can always tweak your indexes for the queries you are running to speed up the response times.  Also there is a lot of tweaking you can do to the network stack and kernel in Linux that will help.\nI have had mine get up to 10GB, with only a moderate number of connections and it handled the requests just fine.\nI would focus first on your indexes, then have a server admin look at your OS, and if all that doesn't help it might be time to implement a master/slave configuration.\n", "xss - Catching SQL Injection and other Malicious Web Requests": "\nYour almost looking at it the wrong way, no 3party tool that is not aware of your application methods/naming/data/domain is going to going to be able to perfectly protect you.\nSomething like SQL injection prevention is something that has to be in the code, and best written by the people that wrote the SQL, because they are the ones that will know what should/shouldnt be in those fields (unless your project has very good docs)\nYour right, this all has been done before.

The immediate advantages that come to mind are:\n\nRunning the tests becomes automate-able and repeatable\nYou can test at a much more granular level than point-and-click testing via a GUI\n\nNote that if your test code writes to a file, opens a database connection or does something over the network, it's more appropriately categorized as an integration test. Integration tests are a good thing, but should not be confused with unit tests. Unit test code should be short, sweet and quick to execute.\nAnother way to look at unit testing is that you write the tests first. This is known as Test-Driven Development (TDD for short). TDD brings additional advantages:\n\nYou don't write speculative \"I might need this in the future\" code -- just enough to make the tests pass\nThe code you've written is always covered by tests\nBy writing the test first, you're forced into thinking about how you want to call the code, which usually improves the design of the code in the long run.\n\nIf you're not doing unit testing now, I recommend you get started on it. Get a good book, practically any xUnit-book will do because the concepts are very much transferable between them. \nSometimes writing unit tests can be painful. When it gets that way, try to find someone to help you, and resist the temptation to \"just write the damn code\". Unit testing is a lot like washing the dishes. It's not always pleasant, but it keeps your metaphorical kitchen clean, and you really want it to be clean. :)\n\nEdit: One misconception comes to mind, although I'm not sure if it's so common. I've heard a project manager say that unit tests made the team write all the code twice. If it looks and feels that way, well, you're doing it wrong. Not only does writing the tests usually speed up development, but it also gives you a convenient \"now I'm done\" indicator that you wouldn't have otherwise.\n", "parallel processing - What are the current best options for parallelizing a CPU-intensive .NET app?": "\nYour first step is to find and understand the parallelism in your problem.

Also this one.\nI'm working from a fairly rusty memory of a statistics course, but here goes nothing:\nWhen you're doing analysis of variance (ANOVA), you actually calculate the F statistic as the ratio from the mean-square variances \"between the groups\" and the mean-square variances \"within the groups\".  The second link above seems pretty good for this calculation.\nThis makes the F statistic measure exactly how powerful your model is, because the \"between the groups\" variance is explanatory power, and \"within the groups\" variance is random error.  High F implies a highly significant model.\nAs in many statistical operations, you back-determine Sig. using the F statistic.  Here's where your Wikipedia information comes in slightly handy.  What you want to do is - using the degrees of freedom given to you by SPSS - find the proper P value at which an F table will give you the F statistic you calculated.  The P value where this happens [F(table) = F(calculated)] is the significance.\nConceptually, a lower significance value shows a very strong ability to reject the null hypothesis (which for these purposes means to determine your model has explanatory power).\nSorry to any math folks if any of this is wrong.

Essentially (I don't have a Windows dev machine handy):\nPick a default amount of time the thread will sleep each iteration.  Then, on each iteration (or on every nth iteration, such that the throttling function doesn't itself become a significant CPU load),\n\nCompute the amount of CPU time your thread used since the last time your throttling function was called (I'll call this dCPU).  You can use the GetThreadTimes() API to get the amount of time your thread has been executing.\nCompute the amount of real time elapsed since the last time your throttling function was called (I'll call this dClock).\ndCPU / dClock is the percent CPU usage (of one CPU).  If it is higher than you want, increase your sleep time, if lower, decrease the sleep time.\nHave your thread sleep for the computed time.\n\nDepending on how your watchdog computes CPU usage, you might want to use GetProcessAffinityMask() to find out how many CPUs the system has.  dCPU / (dClock * CPUs) is the percentage of total CPU time available.\nYou will still have to pick some magic numbers for the initial sleep time and the increment/decrement amount, but I think this algorithm could be tuned to keep a thread running at fairly close to a determined percent of CPU.\n", "list - Python: what is the difference between (1,2,3) and [1,2,3], and when should I use each?": "\nFrom the Python FAQ:\n\nLists and tuples, while similar in many respects, are generally used in fundamentally different ways.

For example, a Cartesian coordinate is appropriately represented as a tuple of two or three numbers.\nLists, on the other hand, are more like arrays in other languages. They tend to hold a varying number of objects all of which have the same type and which are operated on one-by-one.\n\nGenerally by convention you wouldn't choose a list or a tuple just based on its (im)mutability.  You would choose a tuple for small collections of completely different pieces of data in which a full-blown class would be too heavyweight, and a list for collections of any reasonable size where you have a homogeneous set of data.\n", "How far can LISP macros go?": "\nThat's a really good question.\nI think it's nuanced but definitely answerable:\nMacros are not stuck in s-expressions.

All invocations from the View delegate directly to the Presenter. The Presenter is also decoupled directly from the View and talks to it through an interface. This is to allow mocking of the View in a unit test. One common attribute of MVP is that there has to be a lot of two-way dispatching. For example, when someone clicks the \"Save\" button, the event handler delegates to the Presenter's \"OnSave\" method. Once the save is completed, the Presenter will then call back the View through its interface so that the View can display that the save has completed.\nMVP tends to be a very natural pattern for achieving separated presentation in WebForms. The reason is that the View is always created first by the ASP.NET runtime. You can find out more about both variants.\nTwo primary variations\nPassive View: The View is as dumb as possible and contains almost zero logic. A Presenter is a middle man that talks to the View and the Model. The View and Model are completely shielded from one another. The Model may raise events, but the Presenter subscribes to them for updating the View. In Passive View there is no direct data binding, instead, the View exposes setter properties that the Presenter uses to set the data. All state is managed in the Presenter and not the View.\n\nPro: maximum testability surface; clean separation of the View and Model\nCon: more work (for example all the setter properties) as you are doing all the data binding yourself.\n\nSupervising Controller: The Presenter handles user gestures. The View binds to the Model directly through data binding. In this case, it's the Presenter's job to pass off the Model to the View so that it can bind to it. The Presenter will also contain logic for gestures like pressing a button, navigation, etc.\n\nPro: by leveraging data binding the amount of code is reduced.\nCon: there's a less testable surface (because of data binding), and there's less encapsulation in the View since it talks directly to the Model.\n\nModel-View-Controller\nIn the MVC, the Controller is responsible for determining which View to display in response to any action including when the application loads. This differs from MVP where actions route through the View to the Presenter. In MVC, every action in the View correlates with a call to a Controller along with an action. In the web, each action involves a call to a URL on the other side of which there is a Controller who responds. Once that Controller has completed its processing, it will return the correct View. The sequence continues in that manner throughout the life of the application:\n\n    Action in the View\n        -> Call to Controller\n        -> Controller Logic\n        -> Controller returns the View.\n\nOne other big difference about MVC is that the View does not directly bind to the Model. The view simply renders and is completely stateless. In implementations of MVC, the View usually will not have any logic in the code behind. This is contrary to MVP where it is absolutely necessary because, if the View does not delegate to the Presenter, it will never get called.\nPresentation Model\nOne other pattern to look at is the Presentation Model pattern. In this pattern, there is no Presenter. Instead, the View binds directly to a Presentation Model. The Presentation Model is a Model crafted specifically for the View. This means this Model can expose properties that one would never put on a domain model as it would be a violation of separation-of-concerns. In this case, the Presentation Model binds to the domain model and may subscribe to events coming from that Model. The View then subscribes to events coming from the Presentation Model and updates itself accordingly. The Presentation Model can expose commands which the view uses for invoking actions. The advantage of this approach is that you can essentially remove the code-behind altogether as the PM completely encapsulates all of the behavior for the view. This pattern is a very strong candidate for use in WPF applications and is also called Model-View-ViewModel.\nThere is a MSDN article about the Presentation Model and a section in the Composite Application Guidance for WPF (former Prism) about Separated Presentation Patterns\n", "java - How to get started writing a code coverage tool?": "\nDoes your scripting language generate bytecode?

Call is faster than callvirt, and callvirt is mainly used when you don't know if the object has been subclassed. So people assume that if you seal a class all the op codes will change from calvirts to calls and will be faster.\nUnfortunately callvirt does other things that make it useful too, like checking for null references. This means that even if a class is sealed, the reference might still be null and thus a callvirt is needed. You can get around this (without needing to seal the class), but it becomes a bit pointless.\nStructs use call because they cannot be subclassed and are never null.\nSee this question for more information:\nCall and callvirt\n", "LINQ on the .NET 2.0 Runtime": "\nIt's weird that no one has mentioned LINQBridge.

An alternative term is computation builder which is a bit more descriptive of what they are actually useful for.\nThey are a pattern for chaining operations. It looks a bit like method chaining in object-oriented languages, but the mechanism is slightly different.\nThe pattern is mostly used in functional languages (especially Haskell which uses monads pervasively) but can be used in any language which support higher-order functions (that is, functions which can take other functions as arguments).\nArrays in JavaScript support the pattern, so let\u2019s use that as the first example.\nThe gist of the pattern is we have a type (Array in this case) which has a method which takes a function as argument. The operation supplied must return an instance of the same type (i.e. return an Array).\nFirst an example of method chaining which does not use the monad pattern:\n[1,2,3].map(x => x + 1)\n\nThe result is [2,3,4]. The code does not conform to the monad pattern, since the function we are supplying as an argument returns a number, not an Array. The same logic in monad form would be:\n[1,2,3].flatMap(x => [x + 1])\n\nHere we supply an operation which returns an Array, so now it conforms to the pattern. The flatMap method executes the provided function for every element in the array.  It expects an array as result for each invocation (rather than single values), but merges the resulting set of arrays into a single array. So the end result is the same, the array [2,3,4].\n(The function argument provided to a method like map or flatMap is often called a \"callback\" in JavaScript. I will call it the \"operation\" since it is more general.)\nIf we chain multiple operations (in the traditional way):\n[1,2,3].map(a => a + 1).filter(b => b != 3)\n\nResults in the array [2,4]\nThe same chaining in monad form:\n[1,2,3].flatMap(a => [a + 1]).flatMap(b => b != 3 ? [b] : [])\n\nYields the same result, the array [2,4].\nYou will immediately notice that the monad form is quite a bit uglier than the non-monad! This just goes to show that monads are not necessarily \u201cgood\u201d. They are a pattern which is sometimes beneficial and sometimes not.\nDo note that the monad pattern can be combined in a different way:\n[1,2,3].flatMap(a => [a + 1].flatMap(b => b != 3 ? [b] : []))\n\nHere the binding is nested rather than chained, but the result is the same. This is an important property of monads as we will see later. It means two operations combined can be treated the same as a single operation.\nThe operation is allowed to return an array with different element types, for example transforming an array of numbers into an array of strings or something else; as long as it still an Array.\nThis can be described a bit more formally using Typescript notation. An array has the type Array<T>, where T is the type of the elements in the array. The method flatMap() takes a function argument of the type T => Array<U> and returns an Array<U>.\nGeneralized, a monad is any type Foo<Bar> which has a \"bind\" method which takes a function argument of type Bar => Foo<Baz> and returns a Foo<Baz>.\nThis answers what monads are. The rest of this answer will try to explain through examples why monads can be a useful pattern in a language like Haskell which has good support for them.\nHaskell and Do-notation\nTo translate the map/filter example directly to Haskell, we replace flatMap with the >>= operator:\n[1,2,3] >>= \\a -> [a+1] >>= \\b -> if b == 3 then [] else [b] \n\nThe >>= operator is the bind function in Haskell. It does the same as flatMap in JavaScript when the operand is a list, but it is overloaded with different meaning for other types.\nBut Haskell also has a dedicated syntax for monad expressions, the do-block, which hides the bind operator altogether:\n do a <- [1,2,3] \n    b <- [a+1] \n    if b == 3 then [] else [b] \n\nThis hides the \"plumbing\" and lets you focus on the actual operations applied at each step.\nIn a do-block, each line is an operation. The constraint still holds that all operations in the block must return the same type. Since the first expression is a list, the other operations must also return a list.\nThe back-arrow <- looks deceptively like an assignment, but note that this is the parameter passed in the bind. So, when the expression on the right side is a List of Integers, the variable on the left side will be a single Integer \u2013 but will be executed for each integer in the list.\nExample: Safe navigation (the Maybe type)\nEnough about lists, lets see how the monad pattern can be useful for other types.\nSome functions may not always return a valid value. In Haskell this is represented by the Maybe-type, which is an option that is either Just value or Nothing.\nChaining operations which always return a valid value is of course straightforward:\nstreetName = getStreetName (getAddress (getUser 17)) \n\nBut what if any of the functions could return Nothing? We need to check each result individually and only pass the value to the next function if it is not Nothing:\ncase getUser 17 of\n      Nothing -> Nothing \n      Just user ->\n         case getAddress user of\n            Nothing -> Nothing \n            Just address ->\n              getStreetName address\n\nQuite a lot of repetitive checks! Imagine if the chain was longer. Haskell solves this with the monad pattern for Maybe:\ndo\n  user <- getUser 17\n  addr <- getAddress user\n  getStreetName addr\n\nThis do-block invokes the bind-function for the Maybe type (since the result of the first expression is a Maybe). The bind-function only executes the following operation if the value is Just value, otherwise it just passes the Nothing along.\nHere the monad-pattern is used to avoid repetitive code. This is similar to how some other languages use macros to simplify syntax, although macros achieve the same goal in a very different way.\nNote that it is the combination of the monad pattern and the monad-friendly syntax in Haskell which result in the cleaner code. In a language like JavaScript without any special syntax support for monads, I doubt the monad pattern would be able to simplify the code in this case.\nMutable state\nHaskell does not support mutable state. All variables are constants and all values immutable. But the State type can be used to emulate programming with mutable state:\nadd2 :: State Integer Integer\nadd2 = do\n        -- add 1 to state\n         x <- get\n         put (x + 1)\n         -- increment in another way\n         modify (+1)\n         -- return state\n         get\n\n\nevalState add2 7\n=> 9\n\nThe add2 function builds a monad chain which is then evaluated with 7 as the initial state.\nObviously this is something which only makes sense in Haskell. Other languages support mutable state out of the box. Haskell is generally \"opt-in\" on language features - you enable mutable state when you need it, and the type system ensures the effect is explicit. IO is another example of this.\nIO\nThe IO type is used for chaining and executing \u201cimpure\u201d functions.\nLike any other practical language, Haskell has a bunch of built-in functions which interface with the outside world: putStrLine, readLine and so on. These functions are called \u201cimpure\u201d because they either cause side effects or have non-deterministic results. Even something simple like getting the time is considered impure because the result is non-deterministic \u2013 calling it twice with the same arguments may return different values.\nA pure function is deterministic \u2013 its result depends purely on the arguments passed and it has no side effects on the environment beside returning a value.\nHaskell heavily encourages the use of pure functions \u2013 this is a major selling point of the language. Unfortunately for purists, you need some impure functions to do anything useful. The Haskell compromise is to cleanly separate pure and impure, and guarantee that there is no way that pure functions can execute impure functions, directly or indirect.\nThis is guaranteed by giving all impure functions the IO type. The entry point in Haskell program is the main function which have the IO type, so we can execute impure functions at the top level.\nBut how does the language prevent pure functions from executing impure functions? This is due to the lazy nature of Haskell. A function is only executed if its output is consumed by some other function. But there is no way to consume an IO value except to assign it to main. So if a function wants to execute an impure function, it has to be connected to main and have the IO type.\nUsing monad chaining for IO operations also ensures that they are executed in a linear and predictable order, just like statements in an imperative language.\nThis brings us to the first program most people will write in Haskell:\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do \n        putStrLn \u201dHello World\u201d\n\nThe do keyword is superfluous when there is only a single operation and therefore nothing to bind, but I keep it anyway for consistency.\nThe () type means \u201cvoid\u201d. This special return type is only useful for IO functions called for their side effect.\nA longer example:\nmain = do\n    putStrLn \"What is your name?\"\n    name <- getLine\n    putStrLn \"hello\" ++ name\n\nThis builds a chain of IO operations, and since they are assigned to the main function, they get executed.\nComparing IO with Maybe shows the versatility of the monad pattern. For Maybe, the pattern is used to avoid repetitive code by moving conditional logic to the binding function. For IO, the pattern is used to ensure that all operations of the IO type are sequenced and that IO operations cannot \"leak\" to pure functions.\nSumming up\nIn my subjective opinion, the monad pattern is only really worthwhile in a language which has some built-in support for the pattern.

You can do a SELECT INTO to put this straight into your table variable.\nFrom there, iterate through the table and for each row, do a bunch of small SELECT queries that retrieves all the supplemental data you need for your result set. Insert these into each column as you go.\nOnce complete, you can then do a simple SELECT * from your table variable and return this result set to the user.\nI don't have any hard numbers for this, but there have been three distinct instances that I have worked on to date where doing these smaller queries has actually worked faster than doing one massive select query with a bunch of joins.\n", "Are there best practices for testing security in an Agile development shop?": "\nWhat's your application domain? It depends. \nSince you used the word \"Agile\", I'm guessing it's a web app. I have a nice easy answer for you. \nGo buy a copy of Burp Suite (it's the #1 Google result for \"burp\" --- a sure endorsement!); it'll cost you 99EU, or ~$180USD, or $98 Obama Dollars if you wait until November. \nBurp works as a web proxy. You browse through your web app using Firefox or IE or whatever, and it collects all the hits you generate. These hits get fed to a feature called \"Intruder\", which is a web fuzzer. Intruder will figure out all the parameters you provide to each one of your query handlers. It will then try crazy values for each parameter, including SQL, filesystem, and HTML metacharacters. On a typical complex form post, this is going to generate about 1500 hits, which you'll look through to identify scary --- or, more importantly in an Agile context, new --- error responses.\nFuzzing every query handler in your web app at each release iteration is the #1 thing you can do to improve application security without instituting a formal \"SDLC\" and adding headcount. Beyond that, review your code for the major web app security hot spots:\n\nUse only parameterized prepared SQL statements; don't ever simply concatenate strings and feed them to your database handle.\nFilter all inputs to a white list of known good characters (alnum, basic punctuation), and, more importantly, output filter data from your query results to \"neutralize\" HTML metacharacters to HTML entities (quot, lt, gt, etc). \nUse long random hard-to-guess identifiers anywhere you're currently using simple integer row IDs in query parameters, and make sure user X can't see user Y's data just by guessing those identifiers.\nTest every query handler in your application to ensure that they function only when a valid, logged-on session cookie is presented.\nTurn on the XSRF protection in your web stack, which will generate hidden form token parameters on all your rendered forms, to prevent attackers from creating malicious links that will submit forms for unsuspecting users.\nUse bcrypt --- and nothing else --- to store hashed passwords.\n\n", "browser - How can I tell if a web client is blocking advertisements?": "\nSince programs like AdBlock actually never request the advert, you would have to look the server logs to see if the same user accessed a webpage but didn't access an advert.

The pricing models of all the SCPS providers is based around this equation. This dictates the economics of using the service, which is nearly always the most important factor.\nFor example, in the UK securetrading.net have a large annual fee and high minimum transaction values (been a while since I've seen the exact numbers and they don't make it immediately obvious on the site, but this is for illustration only anyway) making it one of the most expensive solutions to use if you are selling high value low volume. Most smaller clients will fall into this model. High value is really anything over a couple of dollars. Low volume is typically anything less than tens of thousands of units per month. However, if you are running a donations service in the aftermath of an international environmental disaster (relatively low value very high volume) then they become one of the cheapest.\nFactor in to this the setup costs (relatively high), and the cost to tie the service into the site (in SecureTrading's case it's very easy to do, but still a lot harder than adding a PayPal button) and you start to build up a true picture.\nOn the flip side, a service such as PayPal has very low setup costs (no fee to pay, and trivially easy to integrate), but relatively high transaction costs. It is great for high value / low volume transactions.\nThe Bank\nThere are two main categories of payment clearance service - Bureau and Bank Acquired.\nIn the UK at least NetBanx, SecureTrading and WorldPay offer both bank acquired and bureau services. ProtX and SecPay offer only bank acquired services. PayPal and its ilk operates slightly outside both definitions (see Protection below).\nA Bank Acquired service plumbs into your normal banking merchant account and clears the funds straight into it. As well as charging you for this service, your bank will also take a slice, typically this is more than the SPCS provider will charge and so it actually is the bank that becomes the deciding factor.\nSome banks will only work with their preferred provider. In the UK, most banks want you to have a separate Internet Merchant Account even if you already have a Merchant Account with them.\nI always tell clients to shop around, as this will make a huge difference to how much their e-commerce venture can bring in. All banks are not created equal.\nBureau services effectively act as your bank at the same time as providing the clearance service. They were popular in a time when banks hadn't grasped the concept of the Internet and would prefer transactions be chiseled into stone tablets if they got their way. Often the choice between a bureau service and a bank acquired service is made for you based on circumstances.\nTrading History\nIn many countries (including the UK), most banks won't give you a merchant account until you have been trading for a particular period of time (2 years in the UK). Your only option is then a bureau service.\nCash flow\nMost bureau services will hold onto your cash as security against \"charge backs\".\nIf you sell me a Ferrari and I am horrified to learn that you've sold me a small metal toy rather than the 1.5 tonnes of Italian automotive passion I was expecting, I will complain to my credit card company who will refund me and then chase your merchant services provider for a refund. They will have to give them the refund and then chase you for the money.\nIt's therefore in their interests to hold on to your money for a period of 4-6 weeks to protect against this. If you sell services or goods with no capital outlay (software for instance), then you can afford this. If on the other hand, you really are having to pay your luxury car importer to provide you with stock, then cash flow becomes very important and you're going to need a bank acquired service where you can be paid immediately.\nProtection\nOne major downside to PayPal and similar services is that it is not covered under the same regulations that govern credit cards.\nSimply put, if you buy something on a credit card your card provider is liable for ensure you get what you paid for (broadly speaking, in most countries, does not constitute legal advice etc.) and if you have a problem with your purchase they will refund you very quickly and then will go and chase the person that you paid.\nThis is the kind of protection you hear about when Leo Laporte advertises American Express on his podcasts. It is a \"Good Thing\"TM. You don't have that protection with PayPal because when you use your credit card on PayPal, you are actually buying PayPal's service. So, even if you are mis-sold a product, the person you paid for the service (PayPal) didn't mis-sell, they provided the service you paid for. This breaks the chain.\nPayPal don't have a legal obligation to protect you in the same way, and their record on refunding ripped off customers is less than spangly. I'm guessing they have \"Caveat Emptor\" writ large on the walls of their head office. :)\nI'm not dissing PayPal, they are way ahead of the curve on many other security features, but just another factor to bear in mind.\nEnd to end integration\nDifferent services differ in their ease of integration. Oh boy do they differ. I'm sitting on some work right now to do an HSBC integration. I'd rather have a root canal. Some of the systems make big assumptions about the way you have to work with them, and are poorly designed or inflexible. Retro-fitting them to an active site can be very painful. Some of them are beautiful and easy to work with (and not necessarily less secure). The biggest difference is how you choose to integrate though.\nMost services integrate by allowing you to redirect to a secure site where your customer fills in his / her details. They are finally redirected back to a page on your own site with the results of the transaction. This works well in most cases and is easiest to integrate.\nWhen you buy something on Amazon, you don't get redirected to WorldPay, or PayPal however. If you want end-to-end integration, most services now will let the communication happen behind the scenes. Your own site has to have a decent secure server certificate of course, and the integration is necessarily more complex.\nReputation\nIt used to be that PayPal was used on dinky sites. You wouldn't catch Amazon using it. That perception has changed a lot, and in fact in some senses PayPal does security better than most. If your audience expects to see PayPal and you give them some other service then you may lose custom, or vice versa. These days many merchants offer a choice to customers.\nUK Providers\n\nWorldPay. Well established. Bureau and bank acquired. Relatively high transaction costs and annual costs. Fairly easy to integrate. Owned ultimately by Royal Bank of Scotland.\nSecPay. Bank Acquired. Low per transaction cost and low annual cost and flexible payment models.\nProtX. Bank Acquired. Low per transaction cost and low annual cost, flexible payment models. Can be quite demanding to integrate.\nHSBC. Bank Acquired. Low per transaction cost. High set up and annual costs. Very inflexible to integrate.\nSecureTrading. Bureau and Bank Acquired. Low per transaction cost but high setup and annual costs. Was a doddle to integrate last time I used it (9 years ago!)\nNetBanx. Bureau and Bank Acquired. Haven't used since 1996 so can't comment!\n\nAnd of course PayPal, Google Checkout and Amazon FPS are well worth looking at and worth a whole answer on their own!\nSummary\nTold you it wasn't that simple! Usually, as developers, we're not in the position to choose for ourselves, and these decisions should be driven by the business needs of our employer / client.\nMost e-commerce projects would start with PayPal or similar. When the business gets enough orders that they could save money by switching to another service, then they've got enough money to pay for the switch.\nDisclaimer: I am UK based, and have performed many integrations with a whole slew of these services over the years, however the market changes all the time and things may have changed and your mileage may vary! I am not a lawyer or accountant, and if you take my advice it's not my fault :)\n", "csv - What is a good web-based Grid that accepts Excel clipboard data?": "\nI'm currently using dhtmlxGrid and we have the Excel copy/paste functionality working.  dhtmlXGrid is the most full featured javascript grid package that I've found.\nOn their website, dhtmlXGrid claims to support Clipboard functionality in the Professional version.

Their support was pretty good in helping us come up with a solution.\nSo to answer your question, you should be able to get them to support copy and paste if you purchase the Professional version.  I'm just warning you that it may take some additional work to fine tune that behavior.  \nOverall, I'm happy with dhtmlXGrid.  We use a lot of their features.  Their support is pretty good.

If there is a recurring issue, you can increase the page file to capture a full dump. I would wait to do this until you have been isntructed by PSS (or someone else qualified to analyze a full dump) request you to capture a full dump. An extremely small percentage of DBAs know how to analyze a full dump. A mini-dump is sufficent for troubleshooting most issues that pop up anyway.\nPlus, if your server is configured to allow a 1 TB full dump and a recurring issue occurs, how much free disk space would you recommend having on hand?

Not a single one is a winner on all accounts, including confluence. Let me try to make your quest a little shorter by summarizing what I have learned to be a pain and what is important:\n\nWYSIWYG is a most have feature for the Enterprise. A wiki without it, skip it\nSaying that, in reality, WYSIWYG doesn't work perfectly. It is more of a feature you must have to get the casual users not be afraid of the monster, and start using it. But you and anyone that wants to seriously create content, will very quickly get used to the wiki markup. it is faster and more reliable. \nYou need good permissions controls (who can see, edit etc' a page). confluence has good, but I have my complaints (to complicated to be put here)\nYou will want a good export feature. Most will give you a single page \"PDF\" export, but you need much more. For example, lets say you have an FAQ, you want to export the entire FAQ right? will that work? \nMacros: you want a community creating macros. You asked for example about the ability to rate pages, here is a link to a Macro for Confluence that lets you do that\nStructure: you want to be able to say that a page is a child of a different page, and be able to browse the data. The wikipedia model, of orphaned pages with no sturcture will not work in the Enterprise. (think FAQ, you want to have a hierarchy no?)\nAbility to easily attache picture to be embedded in the body of the page/article. In confluence, you need to upload the image and then can embed it, it could be a little better (CTR+V) but I guess this is easy enough for 80% of the users.\n\nAt the end of the day, remember that a Wiki will be valuable to you the more flexible it is. It needs to be a \"blank\" canvas, and your imagination is then used to \"build\" the application. In Confluence, I found 3 different \"best practices\" on how to create a FAQ. That means I can implement MANY things. \nSome examples (I use my Wiki for)\n\nFAQ: any error, problem is logged. Used by PS and ENG. reduced internal support time dramatically\nTrack account status: I implemetned sophisticated \"dashboard\" that you can see at a glance which customer is at what state, the software version they have, who in the company 'owns\" the custoemr etc'\nProduct: all documentation, installation instructions, the \"what's new\" etc\nTechnical documentation, DB structure and what the tables mean \nHR: contact list, Document repository \n\nMy runner up (15 month ago) was free Deki_Wiki, time has passed, so I don't know if this would be still my runner up.\ngood luck!\n", "sql - How do I split a delimited string so I can access individual items?": "\nI don't believe SQL Server has a built-in split function, so other than a UDF, the only other answer I know is to hijack the PARSENAME function:\nSELECT PARSENAME(REPLACE('Hello John Smith', ' ', '.'), 2) \n\nPARSENAME takes a string and splits it on the period character.

This can be cast back to a datetime or datetime2 if necessary.\nWhat Is Really Best In SQL Server 2005 and Older?\nI've seen inconsistent claims about what's fastest for truncating the time from a date in SQL Server, and some people even said they did testing, but my experience has been different. So let's do some more stringent testing and let everyone have the script so if I make any mistakes people can correct me.\nFloat Conversions Are Not Accurate\nFirst, I would stay away from converting datetime to float, because it does not convert correctly. You may get away with doing the time-removal thing accurately, but I think it's a bad idea to use it because it implicitly communicates to developers that this is a safe operation and it is not. Take a look:\ndeclare @d datetime;\nset @d = '2010-09-12 00:00:00.003';\nselect Convert(datetime, Convert(float, @d));\n-- result: 2010-09-12 00:00:00.000 -- oops\n\nThis is not something we should be teaching people in our code or in our examples online.\nAlso, it is not even the fastest way!\nProof \u2013 Performance Testing\nIf you want to perform some tests yourself to see how the different methods really do stack up, then you'll need this setup script to run the tests farther down:\ncreate table AllDay (Tm datetime NOT NULL CONSTRAINT PK_AllDay PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED);\ndeclare @d datetime;\nset @d = DateDiff(Day, 0, GetDate());\ninsert AllDay select @d;\nwhile @@ROWCOUNT != 0\n   insert AllDay\n   select * from (\n      select Tm =\n         DateAdd(ms, (select Max(DateDiff(ms, @d, Tm)) from AllDay) + 3, Tm)\n      from AllDay\n   ) X\n   where Tm < DateAdd(Day, 1, @d);\nexec sp_spaceused AllDay;  -- 25,920,000 rows\n\nPlease note that this creates a 427.57\u00a0MB table in your database and will take something like 15-30 minutes to run. If your database is small and set to 10% growth it will take longer than if you size big enough first.\nNow for the actual performance testing script. Please note that it's purposeful to not return rows back to the client as this is crazy expensive on 26 million rows and would hide the performance differences between the methods.\nPerformance Results\nset statistics time on;\n-- (All queries are the same on io: logical reads 54712)\nGO\ndeclare\n    @dd date,\n    @d datetime,\n    @di int,\n    @df float,\n    @dv varchar(10);\n\n-- Round trip back to datetime\nselect @d = CONVERT(date, Tm) from AllDay; -- CPU time = 21234 ms,  elapsed time = 22301 ms.\nselect @d = CAST(Tm - 0.50000004 AS int) from AllDay; -- CPU = 23031 ms, elapsed = 24091 ms.\nselect @d = DATEDIFF(DAY, 0, Tm) from AllDay; -- CPU = 23782 ms, elapsed = 24818 ms.\nselect @d = FLOOR(CAST(Tm as float)) from AllDay; -- CPU = 36891 ms, elapsed = 38414 ms.\nselect @d = CONVERT(VARCHAR(8), Tm, 112) from AllDay; -- CPU = 102984 ms, elapsed = 109897 ms.\nselect @d = CONVERT(CHAR(8), Tm, 112) from AllDay; -- CPU = 103390 ms,  elapsed = 108236 ms.\nselect @d = CONVERT(VARCHAR(10), Tm, 101) from AllDay; -- CPU = 123375 ms, elapsed = 135179 ms.\n\n-- Only to another type but not back\nselect @dd = Tm from AllDay; -- CPU time = 19891 ms,  elapsed time = 20937 ms.\nselect @di = CAST(Tm - 0.50000004 AS int) from AllDay; -- CPU = 21453 ms, elapsed = 23079 ms.\nselect @di = DATEDIFF(DAY, 0, Tm) from AllDay; -- CPU = 23218 ms, elapsed = 24700 ms\nselect @df = FLOOR(CAST(Tm as float)) from AllDay; -- CPU = 29312 ms, elapsed = 31101 ms.\nselect @dv = CONVERT(VARCHAR(8), Tm, 112) from AllDay; -- CPU = 64016 ms, elapsed = 67815 ms.\nselect @dv = CONVERT(CHAR(8), Tm, 112) from AllDay; -- CPU = 64297 ms,  elapsed = 67987 ms.\nselect @dv = CONVERT(VARCHAR(10), Tm, 101) from AllDay; -- CPU = 65609 ms, elapsed = 68173 ms.\nGO\nset statistics time off;\n\nSome Rambling Analysis\nSome notes about this. First of all, if just performing a GROUP BY or a comparison, there's no need to convert back to datetime. So you can save some CPU by avoiding that, unless you need the final value for display purposes. You can even GROUP BY the unconverted value and put the conversion only in the SELECT clause:\nselect Convert(datetime, DateDiff(dd, 0, Tm))\nfrom (select '2010-09-12 00:00:00.003') X (Tm)\ngroup by DateDiff(dd, 0, Tm)\n\nAlso, see how the numeric conversions only take slightly more time to convert back to datetime, but the varchar conversion almost doubles? This reveals the portion of the CPU that is devoted to date calculation in the queries. There are parts of the CPU usage that don't involve date calculation, and this appears to be something close to 19875\u00a0ms in the above queries. Then the conversion takes some additional amount, so if there are two conversions, that amount is used up approximately twice.\nMore examination reveals that compared to Convert(, 112), the Convert(, 101) query has some additional CPU expense (since it uses a longer varchar?), because the second conversion back to date doesn't cost as much as the initial conversion to varchar, but with Convert(, 112) it is closer to the same 20000\u00a0ms CPU base cost.\nHere are those calculations on the CPU time that I used for the above analysis:\n     method   round  single   base\n-----------  ------  ------  -----\n       date   21324   19891  18458\n        int   23031   21453  19875\n   datediff   23782   23218  22654\n      float   36891   29312  21733\nvarchar-112  102984   64016  25048\nvarchar-101  123375   65609   7843\n\n\nround is the CPU time for a round trip back to datetime.\nsingle is CPU time for a single conversion to the alternate data type (the one that has the side effect of removing the time portion).\nbase is the calculation of subtracting from single the difference between the two invocations: single - (round - single). It's a ballpark figure that assumes the conversion to and from that data type and datetime is approximately the same in either direction. It appears this assumption is not perfect but is close because the values are all close to 20000\u00a0ms with only one exception.\n\nOne more interesting thing is that the base cost is nearly equal to the single Convert(date) method (which has to be almost 0 cost, as the server can internally extract the integer day portion right out of the first four bytes of the datetime data type).\nConclusion\nSo what it looks like is that the single-direction varchar conversion method takes about 1.8\u00a0\u03bcs and the single-direction DateDiff method takes about 0.18\u00a0\u03bcs. I'm basing this on the most conservative \"base CPU\" time in my testing of 18458\u00a0ms total for 25,920,000 rows, so 23218\u00a0ms / 25920000 = 0.18\u00a0\u03bcs. The apparent 10x improvement seems like a lot, but it is frankly pretty small until you are dealing with hundreds of thousands of rows (617k rows = 1 second savings).\nEven given this small absolute improvement, in my opinion, the DateAdd method wins because it is the best combination of performance and clarity. The answer that requires a \"magic number\" of 0.50000004 is going to bite someone some day (five zeroes or six???), plus it's harder to understand.\nAdditional Notes\nWhen I get some time I'm going to change 0.50000004 to '12:00:00.003' and see how it does. It is converted to the same datetime value and I find it much easier to remember.\nFor those interested, the above tests were run on a server where @@Version returns the following:\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server 2008 (RTM) - 10.0.1600.22 (Intel X86)   Jul  9 2008 14:43:34   Copyright (c) 1988-2008 Microsoft Corporation  Standard Edition on Windows NT 5.2  (Build 3790: Service Pack 2)\n\n", "c# - Converting ARBG to RGB with alpha blending": "\nIt's called alpha blending.\nIn psuedocode, assuming the background color (blend) always has 255 alpha.

So if we add some key comments to provide maintainers with enough information to know what a piece of code is supposed to be doing, then we have given them the ability to fix a whole lot of bugs.\nThat leaves us with the question of how many comments to put in. If you put in too many comments, things become tedious to maintain and the comments will inevitably be out of date with the code. If you put in too few, then they're not particularly useful.\nI've found regular comments to be most useful in the following places:\n1) A brief description at the top of a .h or .cpp file for a class explaining the purpose of the class.  This helps give maintainers a quick overview without having to sift through all of the code.\n2) A comment block before the implementation of a non-trivial function explaining the purpose of it and detailing its expected inputs, potential outputs, and any oddities to expect when calling the function.  This saves future maintainers from having to decipher entire functions to figure these things out.\nOther than that, I tend to comment anything that might appear confusing or odd to someone. For example: \"This array is 1 based instead of 0 based because of blah blah\".\nWell written, well placed comments are invaluable.  Bad comments are often worse than no comments.  To me, lack of any comments at all indicates laziness and/or arrogance on the part of the author of the code.  No matter how obvious it is to you what the code is doing or how fantastic your code is, it's a challenging task to come into a body of code cold and figure out what the heck is going on.

In order to maintain \"the shape property\" of a binary heap, the lowest level of the heap must always be filled from left to right leaving no empty nodes. To maintain the average O(1) insertion and deletion times for the binary heap, you must be able to determine the location for the next insertion and the location of the last node on the lowest level to use for deletion of the root node, both in constant time.\nFor a binary heap stored in an array (with its implicit, compacted data structure as explained in the Wikipedia entry), this is easy. Just insert the newest data member at the end of the array and then \"bubble\" it into position (following the heap rules). Or replace the root with the last element in the array \"bubbling down\" for deletions. For heaps in array storage, the number of elements in the heap is an implicit pointer to where the next data element is to be inserted and where to find the last element to use for deletion.\nFor a binary heap stored in a tree structure, this information is not as obvious, but because it's a complete binary tree, it can be calculated. For example, in a complete binary tree with 4 elements, the point of insertion will always be the right child of the left child of the root node. The node to use for deletion will always be the left child of the left child of the root node. And for any given arbitrary tree size, the tree will always have a specific shape with well defined insertion and deletion points. Because the tree is a \"complete binary tree\" with a specific structure for any given size, it is very possible to calculate the location of insertion/deletion in O(1) time. However, the catch is that even when you know where it is structurally, you have no idea where the node will be in memory. So, you have to traverse the tree to get to the given node which is an O(log n) process making all inserts and deletions a minimum of O(log n), breaking the usually desired O(1) behavior. Any search (\"depth-first\", or some other) will be at least O(log n) as well because of the traversal issue noted and usually O(n) because of the random nature of the semi-sorted heap.\nThe trick is to be able to both calculate and reference those insertion/deletion points in constant time either by augmenting the data structure (\"threading\" the tree, as mention in the Wikipedia article) or using additional pointers.\nThe implementation which seems to me to be the easiest to understand, with low memory and extra coding overhead, is to just use a normal simple binary tree structure (using a pRoot and Node defined as [data, pParent, pLeftChild, pRightChild]) and add two additional pointers (pInsert and pLastNode). pInsert and pLastNode will both be updated during the insertion and deletion subroutines to keep them current when the data within the structure changes. This implementation gives O(1) access to both insertion point and last node of the structure and should allow preservation of overall O(1) behavior in both insertion and deletions. The cost of the implementation is two extra pointers and some minor extra code in the insertion/deletion subroutines (aka, minimal).\nEDIT: added pseudocode for an O(1) insert()\nHere is pseudo code for an insert subroutine which is O(1), on average:\ndefine Node = [T data, *pParent, *pLeft, *pRight]\n\nvoid insert(T data)\n{\n    do_insertion( data );   // do insertion, update count of data items in tree\n\n    # assume: pInsert points node location of the tree that where insertion just took place\n    #   (aka, either shuffle only data during the insertion or keep pInsert updated during the bubble process)\n\n    int N = this->CountOfDataItems + 1;     # note: CountOfDataItems will always be > 0 (and pRoot != null) after an insertion\n\n    p = new Node( <null>, null, null, null);        // new empty node for the next insertion\n\n    # update pInsert (three cases to handle)\n    if ( int(log2(N)) == log2(N) )\n        {# #1 - N is an exact power of two\n        # O(log2(N))\n        # tree is currently a full complete binary tree (\"perfect\")\n        # ... must start a new lower level\n        # traverse from pRoot down tree thru each pLeft until empty pLeft is found for insertion\n        pInsert = pRoot;\n        while (pInsert->pLeft != null) { pInsert = pInsert->pLeft; }    # log2(N) iterations\n        p->pParent = pInsert;\n        pInsert->pLeft = p;\n        }\n    else if ( isEven(N) )\n        {# #2 - N is even (and NOT a power of 2)\n        # O(1)\n        p->pParent = pInsert->pParent;\n        pInsert->pParent->pRight = p;\n        }\n    else \n        {# #3 - N is odd\n        # O(1)\n        p->pParent = pInsert->pParent->pParent->pRight;\n        pInsert->pParent->pParent->pRight->pLeft = p;\n        }\n    pInsert = p;\n\n    // update pLastNode\n    // ... [similar process]\n}\n\nSo, insert(T) is O(1) on average: exactly O(1) in all cases except when the tree must be increased by one level when it is O(log N), which happens every log N insertions (assuming no deletions). The addition of another pointer (pLeftmostLeaf) could make insert() O(1) for all cases and avoids the possible pathologic case of alternating insertion & deletion in a full complete binary tree. (Adding pLeftmost is left as an exercise [it's fairly easy].)\n", "Writing Blackberry Applications": "\nI've been developing BlackBerry apps for years - almost as long as the devices have been around - and I'm actually currently using a Macbook pro with VMWare, which works well - if you have the RAM (3 gigs is good) and CPU horsepower.  \nThe BlackBerry developer zone (http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/) is definitely the first place you should go - you'll need to download the BlackBerry JDE (Java development environment - their standalone IDE) or the JDE Plugin for Eclipse.

If so, there is a\n    // sudden loud noise.\n    if (energy / last_energy > THRESHOLD):\n        sudden_sound_detected()\n\n    last_energy = energy\n    energy = 0;\n\nI should add a disclaimer that I haven't tried this.\nThis way should be possible to be performed without having the samples all recorded first. As long as there is buffer of some length (WINDOW_SIZE in the example), a numerical integration can be performed to calculate the energy of the section of sound. This does mean however, that there will be a delay in the processing, dependent on the length of the WINDOW_SIZE. Determining a good length for a section of sound is another concern.\nHow to Split into Sections\nIn the first audio file, it appears that the duration of the sound of the door closing is 0.25 seconds, so the window used for numerical integration should probably be at most half of that, or even more like\u3000a tenth, so the difference between the silence and sudden sound can be noticed, even if the window is overlapping between the silent section and the noise section.\nFor example, if the integration window was 0.5 seconds, and the first window was covering the 0.25 seconds of silence and 0.25 seconds of door closing, and the second window was covering 0.25 seconds of door closing and 0.25 seconds of silence, it may appear that the two sections of sound has the same level of noise, therefore, not triggering the sound detection. I imagine having a short window would alleviate this problem somewhat.\nHowever, having a window that is too short will mean that the rise in the sound may not fully fit into one window, and it may apppear that there is little difference in energy between the adjacent sections, which can cause the sound to be missed.\nI believe the WINDOW_SIZE and THRESHOLD are both going to have to be determined empirically for the sound which is going to be detected.\nFor the sake of determining how many samples that this algorithm will need to keep in memory, let's say, the WINDOW_SIZE is 1/10 of the sound of the door closing, which is about 0.025 second. At a sampling rate of 4 kHz, that is 100 samples. That seems to be not too much of a memory requirement. Using 16-bit samples that's 200 bytes.\nAdvantages / Disadvantages\nThe advantage of this method is that processing can be performed with simple integer arithmetic if the source audio is fed in as integers. The catch is, as mentioned already, that real-time processing will have a delay, depending on the size of the section that is integrated.\nThere are a couple of problems that I can think of to this approach:\n\nIf the background noise is too loud, the difference in energy between the background noise and the door closing will not be easily distinguished, and it may not be able to detect the door closing.\nAny abrupt noise, such as a clap, could be regarded as the door is closing.\n\nPerhaps, combining the suggestions in the other answers, such as trying to analyze the frequency signature of the door closing using Fourier analysis, which would require more processing but would make it less prone to error. \nIt's probably going to take some experimentation before finding a way to solve this problem.\n", "django - Trying to update a form it does an insertion!": "\nWell maybe in the line \nform = EntryForm(request.POST, instance=entry)\nyou dont specify an intance parameter, because this is for update an existing model....\n", "python - Deleting multiple elements from a list": "\nFor some reason I don't like any of the answers here.\nYes, they work, but strictly speaking most of them aren't deleting elements in a list, are they?

Last year I went from a build time of 8-10 minutes to 2-3 just by this switch (ant build of same code base);\nTypically your dev environment then matches your production environment (if you're production environment is Windows your dev environment will be Windows almost guaranteed), which can be useful.  We've had issues with Java classpath visibility because of differences between JBoss on Windows and Linux; and\nA much better set of command line tools (yes I knwo you can use Cygwin, etc but it's not as good).\n\nThat's one reason why I find the idea of a Mac as my next dev workstation so appealling: you can look it as either Unix with applications (ie Office) or Windows with a decent filesystem (will be even better if/when OSX adopts ZFS), either way it's a win.

A colocated server on the other side of the country does nicely for these purposes. To minimize downtime of having to switch to the secondary location keep your TTL on the DNS records as low as you are comfortable.\nOf course, so much hardware is going to be steep so you'll need to determine what is worth being down for 1 second, 1 minute, 10 minutes, etc. and adjust accordingly.\n", "visual studio - Why does C# designer-generated code (like Form1.designer.cs) play havoc with Subversion?": "\nHere are some things to try:\n\nMake things more modular.

If ETag is all it has, it will always have to make a request.  However, when the server reads the ETag from the client request, the server can then determine whether to send the file (HTTP 200) or tell the client to just use their local copy (HTTP 304).  An ETag is basically just a checksum for a file that semantically changes when the content of the file changes.\nThe Expires header is used by the client (and proxies/caches) to determine whether or not it even needs to make a request to the server at all.  The closer you are to the Expires date, the more likely it is the client (or proxy) will make an HTTP request for that file from the server.\nSo really what you want to do is use BOTH headers - set the Expires header to a reasonable value based on how often the content changes.  Then configure ETags to be sent so that when clients DO send a request to the server, it can more easily determine whether or not to send the file back.\nOne last note about ETag - if you are using a load-balanced server setup with multiple machines running Apache you will probably want to turn off ETag generation.  This is because inodes are used as part of the ETag hash algorithm which will be different between the servers.  You can configure Apache to not use inodes as part of the calculation but then you'd want to make sure the timestamps on the files are exactly the same, to ensure the same ETag gets generated for all servers.\n", "uiwebview - Web image display in iPhone app": "\nDisplaying the image: you could create a UIWebView and just point it to the path - and then it's fully zoomable too.\nDisplaying in the list view:\n//Somehow download your image...\ncell.image = Your Image\n\n", "Wordpress Blog :: 500 Internal Server Error": "\nThis is almost always a problem with your Apache configuration.

If you now include that header into two files that are compiled separately, the linker, when trying to link the compiled object files, will throw out an error, because it then sees a cross function being defined twice. \nIt works without exlicitly putting inline for member functions of a class, because member functions that are defined inside the class definition are implicitly inline. \nIt is however, not a good idea generally to make function definitions in the header. If your function would depend on other types than just the vector (in your case it's fine IMHO, but it's debatable of course - some people don't like it), then you would be required to include the headers for those types. That will unnecessarily bloat the code that's indirectly included by your header. Instead, in those cases you would solely put only a declaration of your function inside the header:\nVector3d cross(const Vector3d &v0, const Vector3d &v1);\n\nBut define it within the .cpp file that's compiled separately. The inline, of course, should then be dropped. \n\nLet me add a small list of definitions and declarations, just to help in keeping things clear about what declaration and definition means for functions and classes.

(Or scaling.  Or skew.  Etc.)  That you can multiply such a Matrix by a point (V) to get the new (translated/rotated/etc) point.  E.g.:\nMtranlate = [ 1 0 0 Tx ]   *  V = [ Vx ]   =   [ Vx + Tx ]\n            [ 0 1 0 Ty ]          [ Vy ]       [ Vy + Ty ]\n            [ 0 0 1 Tz ]          [ Vz ]       [ Vz + Tz ]\n            [ 0 0 0 1  ]          [  1 ]       [  1      ]\n\nOr rotation about the X/Y/Z axis:\nMrotate_x = [ 1  0     0    0 ]  * V =  [ Vx ]   =   [ Vx              ]\n            [ 0 cos  -sin   0 ]         [ Vy ]       [ Vy*cos - Vz*sin ]\n            [ 0 sin   cos   0 ]         [ Vz ]       [ Vy*sin + Vz*cos ]\n            [ 0  0     0    1 ]         [  1 ]       [  1              ]\n\nThat you can combine multiple operations by multiplying the matrices together.    For example:  Mnew = Mtranslate * Mrotate_x.  \n(And yes, the order does matter!)\nSo given a real-world base origin, you could translate to your (known/supplied) orc's xy location, deduce from the terrain at that point what your orc's feet's z location is and translate to that.  Now you have your orc's \"feet\" in global coordinates.  From there, you might want to rotate your orc so he faces a particular direction.\nThen translate upwards (based on your orc's model) to find it's neck.  From the neck, we can translate upwards (and perhaps rotate) to find its head or over to find its shoulder.  From the shoulder, we can rotate and translate to find the elbow.  From the elbow we can rotate and translate to find the hand.\nEach component of your orc model has a local reference frame.  Each is related to the reference frame where it is attached by one or more transforms (matrices).  By multiplying through all the local matrices (transforms), we can eventually see how to go from the orc's feet to his hand.\n(Mind you, I'd animate the orc and just use his feet x,y,z location.  Otherwise it's too much work.)\nYou see a lot of this sort of thing in robotics which can provide a nice elementary introduction to forward kinematics.  In robotics, at least with the simpler robots, you have a motor which rotates, and a limb-length to translate by.  And then there's another motor.  (In contrast, the human shoulder-joint can rotate about all three axis at once.)\nYou might look over the course HANDOUTS for CMU's Robotic Manipulation class (15-384).\nPerhaps something like their Forward Kinematics Intro.\n", "c - Material to learn GObject and Glib": "\nStart with Glib, its quite easy and well described here: Glib Reference Manual\nGObject is mostly a lot of boilerplate code to achieve object orientation.

In the examples above, one should never write the line arg = . Since humans make mistakes, and programmers are human, let\u2019s ask the compiler to assist us. Mark every parameter/argument variable as 'final' so that the compiler may find and flag any such re-assignments.\nIn Retrospect\nAs noted in other answers\u2026\nGiven Java's original design goal of helping programmers to avoid dumb mistakes such as reading past the end of an array, Java should have been designed to automatically enforce all parameter/argument variables as 'final'. In other words, Arguments should not be variables. But hindsight is 20/20 vision, and the Java designers had their hands full at the time.\nSo, always add final to all arguments?\nShould we add final to each and every method parameter being declared?\n\nIn theory, yes.\nIn practice, no.\u27a5 Add final only when the method\u2019s code is long or complicated, where the argument may be mistaken for a local or member variable and possibly re-assigned.\n\nIf you buy into the practice of never re-assigning an argument, you will be inclined to add a final to each. But this is tedious and makes the declaration a bit harder to read.\nFor short simple code where the argument is obviously an argument, and not a local variable nor a member variable, I do not bother adding the final. If the code is quite obvious, with no chance of me nor any other programmer doing maintenance or refactoring accidentally mistaking the argument variable as something other than an argument, then don\u2019t bother. In my own work, I add final only in longer or more involved code where an argument might mistaken for a local or member variable.\n#Another case added for the completeness\npublic class MyClass {\n    private int x;\n    //getters and setters\n}\n\nvoid doSomething( final MyClass arg ) {  // Mark argument as 'final'.\n  \n   arg =  new MyClass();  // Compiler error: The passed argument variable arg  cannot be re-assigned to another object.\n\n   arg.setX(20); // allowed\n  // We can re-assign properties of argument which is marked as final\n }\n\nrecord\nJava 16 brings the new records feature. A record is a very brief way to define a class whose central purpose is to merely carry data, immutably and transparently.\nYou simply declare the class name along with the names and types of its member fields. The compiler implicitly provides the constructor, getters, equals & hashCode, and toString.\nThe fields are read-only, with no setters. So a record is one case where there is no need to mark the arguments final. They are already effectively final. Indeed, the compiler forbids using final when declaring the fields of a record.\npublic record Employee( String name , LocalDate whenHired )  // \ud83e\udc44 Marking `final` here is *not* allowed.\n{\n}\n\nIf you provide an optional constructor, there you can mark final.\npublic record Employee(String name , LocalDate whenHired)  // \ud83e\udc44 Marking `final` here is *not* allowed.\n{\n    public Employee ( final String name , final LocalDate whenHired )  // \ud83e\udc44 Marking `final` here *is* allowed.\n    {\n        this.name = name;\n        whenHired = LocalDate.MIN;  // \ud83e\udc44 Compiler error, because of `final`. \n        this.whenHired = whenHired;\n    }\n}\n\n", "In Python - how to execute system command with no output": "\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nsubprocess.call([\"ls\", \"-l\"], stdout=open(os.devnull, \"w\"), stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)\n\n", "How can I convert from a SID to an account name in C#": "\nSee here for a good answer:\nThe best way to resolve display username by SID?\nThe gist of it is this bit:\nstring sid=\"S-1-5-21-789336058-507921405-854245398-9938\";\nstring account = new System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier(sid).Translate(typeof(System.Security.Principal.NTAccount)).ToString();\n\nThis approach works for me for non-local SID's over the active directory.\n", "multithreading - Accessing Variable in Parent Form from OnTimer Event - Getting Exception": "\nJust to be sure: On one hand you are talking about a timer event, on the other about multithreading.

In this case, the code in different threads runs independently from each other. If running on a multi-processor machine (or multi core), it is even possible they truly run in parallel.

Additionally, many wrappers have a flag to determine whether they should close the wrapped stream. StreamReader doesn't, but some do (such as GZipStream, which has a leaveOpen ctor option). If you don't want to flow ownership, this is an option - or use a non-closing stream intermediary - one is here (NonClosingStream or similar).\nRe books; I picked up a copy of \"TCP/IP Sockets in C#: Practical Guide for Programmers\" (here) - adequate, but not great.\n", "Why did these two program behave differently in ANSI C?": "\nFor the first one the right-hand side is an unsigned char, and all unsigned char values fit into a signed int, so it is converted to signed int.\nFor the second one the right-hand side is an unsigned int, so the left-hand side is converted from signed int to unsigned int.\nSee also this CERT document on integer conversions.\n", "c - signed to unsigned conversions": "\nIn your example d is converted to an unsigned int in the comparison.

Vertices not cached need a relatively expensive transform operation to calculate.  \"Mesh optimisation\" to restructure triangle meshes to optimise cache usage used to be a pretty hot research topic.  Googling\n  vertex cache optimisation\n(or optimization :^) might find you some interesting material relevant to your problem.  As other posters suggest, I suspect doing this effectively will depend on exploiting any inherent coherence in your data.\nAnother thing to bear in mind: as an LRU cache becomes overloaded it can be well worth changing to an MRU replacement strategy to at least hold some of the items in memory (rather than turning over the entire cache each pass).

In a few words, it happens due to unfulfillment of contract, which FilteringSelect expects from QueryReadStore. And as QueryReadStore totally relies on response from server module, which generates json, it could not fulfil contract due to unexpected response from server.\nAs I figured out, at the end of user input FilteringSelect expects Store (QueryReadStore in this case) to only return items that exactly match entered or selected string. FilteringSelect consider that input is ended when enter key pressed or when user leaves field. Before this two events, text, which is entered or selected is just text. No item is actually selected at the moment.\nIn other words, at the end of input, FilteringSelect expects Store to return zero items if nothing should be selected, or one item, that should be selected. So, then you provide list of regions, FilteringSelect just can't determine which one to choose, and stops at first of them.\nAs you mentioned, QueryReadStore sends request at every keystroke. At this case (before input ended) FilteringSelect expects Store to return items that match pattern. By default pattern is \"enteredString*\" where asteriks is any sequence.\nTo distinguish between two cases, QueryReadStore slighlty vary requests:  \n\nsample request on every keystroke: /query/regions?name=enteredString*&start=0&count=5\nsample request on end of input: /query/regions?name=enteredString&start=0\n\nAs you see, in second request there is no asteriks at the end of \"enteredString\". This variations could help to build correct response at server side.\nI hope I have explained it well.

You should at the very least make yourself familiar with the idea of basic differentiation of functions, the chain rule, partial derivatives (the gradient, the Jacobian and the Hessian), and understanding matrix multiplication and diagonalization. \nReally what you are doing when you train a network is optimizing a large, multidimensional function (minimizing your error measure with respect to each of the weights in the network), and so an investigation of techniques for nonlinear numerical optimization may prove instructive. This is a widely studied problem with a large base of literature outside of neural networks, and there are plenty of lecture notes in numerical optimization available on the web. To start, most people use simple gradient descent, but this can be much slower and less effective than more nuanced methods like \nOnce you've got the basic ideas down you can start to experiment with different \"squashing\" functions in your hidden layer, adding various kinds of regularization, and various tweaks to make learning go faster.

It's fairly old by this stage but is still an excellent resource, and you can often find used copies online for about $30. The neural network chapter in his newer book, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, is also quite comprehensive. For a particularly good implementation-centric tutorial, see this one on CodeProject.com which implements a clever sort of network called a convolutional network, which constrains connectivity in such a way as to make it very good at learning to classify visual patterns.\nSupport vector machines and other kernel methods have become quite popular because you can apply them without knowing what the hell you're doing and often get acceptable results.

The answer to that is the magic of Python metaclasses.\nA metaclass allows you to hook into and modify the process of creating a Python class (not the creation of an instance of that class, the creation of the class itself).\nDjango's Model object (and thus also your models, which are subclasses) has a ModelBase metaclass.  It looks through all the class attributes of your model, and any that are instances of a Field subclass it moves into a fields list.  That list is assigned as an attribute of the _meta object, which is a class attribute of the model.  Thus you can always get to the actual Field objects via MyModel._meta.fields, or MyModel._meta.get_field('field_name').\nThe Model.__init__ method is then able to use the _meta.fields list to determine what instance attributes should be initialized when a model instance is created.\nDon't be afraid to dive into the Django source code; it's a great source of education!\n", "javascript - Change the selected value of a drop-down list with jQuery": "\njQuery's documentation states:\n\n[jQuery.val] checks, or selects, all the radio buttons, checkboxes, and select options that match the set of values.\n\nThis behavior is in jQuery versions 1.2 and above.\nYou most likely want this:\n$(\"._statusDDL\").val('2');\n\nAdd .change() to see the option in the dropdown list frontend:\n$(\"._statusDDL\").val('2').change();\n\n", "oop - C++ using scoped_ptr as a member variable": "\nscoped_ptr is very good for this purpose. But one has to understand its semantics. You can group smart pointers using two major properties:\n\nCopyable: A smart pointer can be copied: The copy and the original share ownership.\nMovable: A smart pointer can be moved: The move-result will have ownership, the original won't own anymore. \n\nThat's rather common terminology. For smart pointers, there is a specific terminology which better marks those properties:\n\nTransfer of Ownership: A smart pointer is Movable\nShare of Ownership: A smart pointer is copyable. If a smart pointer is already copyable, it's easy to support transfer-of-ownership semantic: That then is just an atomic copy & reset-of-original operation, restricting that to smart pointers of certain kinds (e.g only temporary smart pointers). \n\nLet's group the available smart pointers, using (C)opyable, and (M)ovable, (N)either:\n\nboost::scoped_ptr: N\nstd::auto_ptr: M\nboost::shared_ptr: C\n\nauto_ptr has one big problem, in that it realizes the Movable concept using a copy constructor. That is because When auto_ptr was accepted into C++, there wasn't yet a way to natively support move semantics using a move constructor, as opposed to the new C++ Standard. That is, you can do the following with auto_ptr, and it works:\nauto_ptr<int> a(new int), b;\n// oops, after this, a is reset. But a copy was desired!\n// it does the copy&reset-of-original, but it's not restricted to only temporary\n// auto_ptrs (so, not to ones that are returned from functions, for example).\nb = a; \n\nAnyway, as we see, in your case you won't be able to transfer the ownership to another object: Your object will in effect be non-copyable. And in the next C++ Standard, it will be non-movable if you stay with scoped_ptr. \nFor implementing your class with scoped_ptr, watch that you either have one of these two points satisfied:\n\nWrite an destructor (even if it's empty) in the .cpp file of your class, or\nMake Owned a completely defines class. \n\nOtherwise, when you would create an object of Example, the compiler would implicitly define a destructor for you, which would call scoped_ptr's destructor:\n~Example() { ptr.~scoped_ptr<Owned>(); }\n\nThat would then make scoped_ptr call boost::checked_delete, which would complain about Owned being incomplete, in case you haven't done any of the above two points. If you have defined your own dtor in the .cpp file, the implicit call to the destructor of scoped_ptr would be made from the .cpp file, in which you could place the definition of your Owned class. \nYou have that same problem with auto_ptr, but you have one more problem: Providing auto_ptr with an incomplete type is undefined behavior currently (maybe it will be fixed for the next C++ version). So, when you use auto_ptr, you have to make Owned a complete type within your header file. \nshared_ptr doesn't have that problem, because it uses a polymorphic deleter, which makes an indirect call to the delete. So the deleting function is not instantiated at the time the destructor is instantiated, but at the time the deleter is created in shared_ptr's constructor. \n", "modeling - Modelling C applications": "\nA well written text documentation brings you a far.

For your task, you should look at the following.\n\nIf you just need a task to run the easiest way is to use QueueUserWorkItem, which simply takes a delegate to run. The disadvantage is that you have little control over the job. The delegate can't return a value, and you don't know when the run is completed. \nIf you want a little more control, you can use the BeginInvoke/EndInvoke interface of delegates. This schedules the code to run on a thread pool thread. You can query the status via the IAsyncResult handle returned by BeginInvoke, and you can get the result (as well as any exception on the worker thread) via EndInvoke. \n\nTo use the Enter/Exit on Monitor properly, you have to make sure that Exit is always called. Therefore you should place your Exit call in a finally block. \nHowever, if you don't need to supply a timeout value for Enter, you would be much better off just using the lock keyword, which compiles into a proper set of Enter and Exit calls. \n", "c# - do all local variables go on the stack": "\nre the efficiency question; the two are identical, and in release mode will be reduced to the same thing.

You will end up doing two rewrites. Firstly, you request test.php. This gets rewritten to index.php?PAGE=test.php. A second request is now made for index.php?PAGE=test.php. This still matches your rewrite pattern, and in turn gets rewritten to index.php?PAGE=index.php.\nOne solution would be to add a RewriteCond that checks if the file is already \"index.php\".

You could either derive from SafeFileDialog and expose a public method which will call OnFileOk or just call OnFileOk using reflection. That will then call the event handlers for FileOk. I'm not sure I particularly like either of these plans of attack, but without more information about what you're trying to do I thought I'd just answer the question instead of questioning too much :)\n\n* In fact, .NET itself does have the idea of the \"raise\" part of an event, hence EventInfo.GetRaiseMethod.

This makes it possible to spread a complex regex over several lines, using indentation to indicate block structure.\n2) If you don't like the line-noise-resembling symbols themselves, it's not too hard to write your own functions that build regular expressions.  E.g. in Perl:\nsub at_start { '^'; }\nsub at_end { '$'; }\nsub any { \".\"; }\nsub zero_or_more { \"(?:$_[0])*\"; }\nsub one_or_more { \"(?:$_[0])+\"; }\nsub optional { \"(?:$_[0])?\"; }\nsub remember { \"($_[0])\"; }\nsub one_of { \"(?:\" . join(\"|\", @_) . \")\"; }\nsub in_charset { \"[$_[0]]\"; }       # I know it's broken for ']'...\nsub not_in_charset { \"[^$_[0]]\"; }   # I know it's broken for ']'...\n\nThen e.g. a regex to match a quoted string (/^\"(?:[^\\\\\"]|\\\\.)*\"/) becomes:\nat_start .\n'\"' .\nzero_or_more(\n    one_of(\n        not_in_charset('\\\\\\\\\"'),    # Yuck, 2 levels of escaping required\n        '\\\\\\\\' . any\n    )\n) .\n'\"'\n\nUsing this \"string-building functions\" strategy lends itself to expressing useful building blocks as functions (e.g. the above regex could be stored in a function called quoted_string(), you might have other functions for reliably matching any numeric value, an email address, etc.).\n", "html - IE & Drop Down Menus triggering the Pop-Up Blocker": "\nYou said \"I am using TredoSoft MultipleIEs \"\nI am having the EXACT same problem, and I am using Internet Explorer Collection to run multiple versions on one pc.

So really the time between refreshes is 10 seconds + length of ajax call. The benefit of this is if your server takes longer than 10 seconds to respond, you don't get two (and eventually, many) simultaneous AJAX calls happening. \nAlso, if the server fails to respond, it won't keep trying. \nI've used a similar method in the past using .ajax to handle even more complex behaviour:\nfunction update() {\n  $(\"#notice_div\").html('Loading..'); \n  $.ajax({\n    type: 'GET',\n    url: 'response.php',\n    timeout: 2000,\n    success: function(data) {\n      $(\"#some_div\").html(data);\n      $(\"#notice_div\").html(''); \n      window.setTimeout(update, 10000);\n    },\n    error: function (XMLHttpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown) {\n      $(\"#notice_div\").html('Timeout contacting server..');\n      window.setTimeout(update, 60000);\n    }\n}\n\nThis shows a loading message while loading (put an animated gif in there for typical \"web 2.0\" style). If the server times out (in this case takes longer than 2s) or any other kind of error happens, it shows an error, and it waits for 60 seconds before contacting the server again.\nThis can be especially beneficial when doing fast updates with a larger number of users, where you don't want everyone to suddenly cripple a lagging server with requests that are all just timing out anyways.\n", "How to Approach Pointers in C?": "\nPrinting addresses and values is a reasonable way to look at them. But if you can get a debugger up and running, that's much better, because you can follow pointers faster, watch them change as you step, and so on.\nIf you're familiar with \"shortcuts\" in Windows, or soft links in linux filesystems, then it might help, just as you're getting started, to think of a pointer as a shortcut (softlink) to another object (whether that object is a struct, a built-in type, another pointer, etc).\nA shortcut is still a file. It takes up its own space on the disk drive, it refers to another file, and it can be modified to refer to a different file file from what it used to. Similarly, a pointer in C is an object which occupies memory, contains the address of another memory location, and can be changed to contain a different address just by assigning to it.\nOne difference is if you double-click a shortcut, it behaves as if you'd double-clicked the thing it points to. That's not the case with pointers - you always have to explicitly dereference a pointer with \"*\" or \"->\" in order to access the thing it points to. Another difference is that it's quite common to have pointers to pointers to something in C.\nAs for the jargon, you just have to learn it unfortunately. \"int doSomething(char **hihi)\" means \"a function called doSomething, which returns an integer, and takes as a parameter a pointer to pointer a char\". The crucial point is that \"char ** hihi\" means \"a pointer-to-pointer-to-char. We will call the pointer-to-pointer-to-char hihi\". You say that the \"type\" of hihi is char**, and that the \"type\" of *hihi (what you get when you dereference the pointer) is char*, and the type of **hihi is char.\nFrequently in C, a pointer to a char means a string (in other words, it's a pointer to the first char in a NUL-terminated array). So often \"char *\" means \"string\", but it doesn't have to. It might just mean a pointer to one char. A bit like a shortcut to a 1-byte file in Windows (well, with FAT32 anyway), a pointer to a char in C is actually bigger than the thing it points to :-)\nLikewise, a char** often means not just a pointer to one string-pointer, but to an array of string-pointers. It might not, but if it does then the following little picture might help:\n\nhihi\n ____            ____                     ________     _________      _______\n|____|   -----> |____|  *hihi       ---> |___A____|   |___B_____|    |___C___|\n                |____|  *(hihi+1)   ------------------^              ^\n                |____|  *(hihi+2)   ---------------------------------|\n                | ...|    etc.\n\nhihi points to the tower-block effort, which is my way of representing an array of pointers. As you already noted, I could have written hihi[0] in place of *hihi, hihi[1] in place of *(hihi+1), and so on.\nThis is a contiguous block of memory, and each pointer-sized chunk of it contains the address of (that is, it \"points to\") another block of memory, off goodness-knows-where, containing one or more chars. So, hihi[0] is the address of the first char of string A, hihi[1] is the address of the first char of string B.\nIf hihi doesn't point to an array, just a single pointer, then the tower block is a bungalow. Likewise if *hihi doesn't point to a string, just one char, then the long thin block is a square. You might ask, \"how do I know how many floors the tower block has?\". That's a big deal in C programming - usually either the function documentation would tell you (it might say \"1\", or \"12\", or \"enough for the thing you're telling me to do\", or else you would pass the number of floors as an extra parameter, or else the documentation would tell you that the array is \"NULL terminated\", meaning that it will keep reading until it sees the address/value NULL, and then stop. The main function actually does both the second and third thing - argc contains the number of arguments, and just to be on the safe side argv is NULL-terminated.\nSo, whenever you see a pointer parameter, you have to look at the documentation for the function to see whether it expecting a pointer to an array, and if so how big the array has to be. If you aren't careful about this, you will create a kind of bug called \"buffer overflow\", where a function is expecting a pointer to a large array, you give it a pointer to a small array, and it scribbles off the end of what you gave it and starts corrupting memory.\n", "Generating an image with data fields using Java": "\nyou could use jfreechart\nhere is some nice tutorial\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/marx-jchart.html\n", "winapi - Best way of getting path to \"Application Data\" directory?": "\nI would suggest that calling SHGetFolderPath() is the most appropriate, and portable method; the alternatives, such as reading an environment variable, or (worse) trying to extract it from the registry are likely to trip you up in the future.\nRaymond Chen has an article explaining why pulling such paths from the registry is a bad idea.\n", "multithreading - Is there any way for executing a method multiple times, but managing connections/threads?

That's because numpy.ndarray has the special methods for numeric operations but raises TypeError if you try to use them inappropriately with string or object arrays. You could add an explicit check for this like\n ... and not (isinstance(obj, ndarray) and obj.dtype.kind in 'OSU')\n\nThis may be good enough. \nBut... you can never be 100% sure that somebody won't define another type with the same behavior, so a more foolproof way is to actually try to do a calculation and catch the exception, something like\ndef is_numeric_paranoid(obj):\n    try:\n        obj+obj, obj-obj, obj*obj, obj**obj, obj/obj\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return True\n    except Exception:\n        return False\n    else:\n        return True\n\nbut depending on how often you plan to call use it and with what arguments, this may not be practical (it can be potentially slow, e.g. with large arrays).\n", "Create bat or script file to delete files": "\nAs @devio commented, PowerShell is definitely more fully featured: PowerShell Quick Reference\nIf it has to be a Batch file, this reference explains most commands.\n", "debugging - How to enable NSDebugEnabled/NSEnableAutoreleasePool on iPhone": "\nYou have to go into the \"Get info\" contextual menu of your executable (inside the \"Executables\" group in the left panel of XCode).

When a clients connects to the service you will need to store their callback info and when the data is updated you just fire off the message to each subscribed clients.\nHere is the contract for the callback:\npublic interface IServiceMessageCallback\n{\n\n    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]\n    void OnReceivedServiceMessage(ServiceMessage serviceMessage);\n}\n\nThe service implements this interface.  The service has this private field:\n    /// <summary>\n    /// Holds the callback recipients\n    /// </summary>\n    private List<IServiceMessageCallback> callbackMessages = \n              new List<IServiceMessageCallback>();\n\nWhen the clients connects do something like this:\n    IServiceMessageCallback callback = \n       OperationContext.Current.GetCallbackChannel<IServiceMessageCallback>();\n    callbackMessages.Add(callback);\n\nAnd finally, whatever method you have that updates the data on the service should also have this:\n    Action<IServiceMessageCallback> fire =\n         delegate(IServiceMessageCallback callback)\n             { callback.OnReceivedServiceMessage(serviceMessage); };\n\n    // loop thru the callback channels and perform the action\n    callbackMessages.ForEach(fire);\n\nI sort of patched this code together from a rather hefty service I wrote... hopefully the pieces make sense out of context.\n", "sql server - What is the best way to refresh a rollup table under load?": "\nThe way I have done this in a few projects is to use two copies of the table in different schemas.  So something like:\nCREATE SCHEMA fake WITH AUTHORIZATION dbo;\nCREATE SCHEMA standby WITH AUTHORIZATION dbo;\nGO\n\nCREATE TABLE dbo.mySummary(<...columns...>);\n\nCREATE TABLE fake.mySummary(<...columns...>);\nGO\n\nNow create a stored procedure that truncates and re-populates the fake table, then in a transaction move the objects between schemas.\nCREATE PROCEDURE dbo.SwapInSummary\nAS\nBEGIN\n    SET NOCOUNT ON;\n\n    TRUNCATE TABLE fake.mySummary;\n\n    INSERT fake.mySummary(<...columns...>)\n        SELECT <expensive query>;\n\n    BEGIN TRANSACTION;\n        ALTER SCHEMA standby TRANSFER dbo.mySummary;\n        ALTER SCHEMA dbo     TRANSFER fake.mySummary;\n        ALTER SCHEMA fake    TRANSFER standby.mySummary;\n    COMMIT TRANSACTION;\nEND\nGO\n\nThis is probably about the shortest amount of time you can make users wait for the new data to be refreshed and without disrupting them in the middle of a read.  (There are many issues associated with NOLOCK that make it a less desirable alternative, though admittedly, it is easy to code.)  For brevity/clarity I've left out error handling etc., and I should also point out that if you use scripts to synchronize your databases, make sure you name constraints, indexes etc. the same on both tables, otherwise you will be out of sync half of the time.  At the end of the procedure you can TRUNCATE the new fake.MySummary table, but if you have the space, I like to leave the data there so I can always compare to the previous version.\nBefore SQL Server 2005 I used sp_rename inside the transaction to accomplish exactly the same thing, however since I do this in a job, I was glad about switching to schemas, because when I did, the non-suppress-able warning from sp_rename stopped filling up my SQL Server Agent history logs.\n", "sql server - TSQL OLE (com) Objects": "\nJust make sure you can't do it as a set-based operation first, remember to free them when you're done, and remember that this isn't going to be at all portable (but then neither would the clr code).\n", "visual studio - Unable to launch the ASP.NET Development server because port '1900' is in use": "\nSimply end all Webdev.WebServer.exe processes - did the trick for me.\nOccasionally this 'unable to launch because port is in use' error happens when one of the visual studio processes (webdev.webserver.exe) is still running and locked.

This is the reason immutable objects are so valuable.  Try to isolate mutable objects to a single thread, and then carefully control the exchange of mutable objects between threads.  Attempt to program with a design of object hand-over, rather than \"shared\" objects.  For the latter, use fully synchronized control objects (which are easier to reason about), and avoid having a synchronized object utilize other objects which must also be synchronized - that is, try to keep them self contained.  Your best defense is a good design.\nDeadlocks are the easiest to debug, if you can get a stack trace when deadlocked.  Given the trace, most of which do deadlock detection, it's easy to pinpoint the reason and then reason about the code as to why and how to fix it.  With deadlocks, it always going to be a problem acquiring the same locks in different orders.\nLive locks are harder - being able to observe the system while in the error state is your best bet there.\nRace conditions tend to be extremely difficult to replicate, and are even harder to identify from manual code review.  With these, the path I usually take, besides extensive testing to replicate, is to reason about the possibilities, and try to log information to prove or disprove theories.  If you have direct evidence of state corruption you may be able to reason about the possible causes based on the corruption.\nThe more complex the system, the harder it is to find concurrency errors, and to reason about it's behavior.  Make use of tools like JVisualVM and remote connect profilers - they can be a life saver if you can connect to a system in an error state and inspect the threads and objects.\nAlso, beware the differences in possible behavior which are dependent on the number of CPU cores, pipelines, bus bandwidth, etc.  Changes in hardware can affect your ability to replicate the problem.  Some problems will only show on single-core CPU's others only on multi-cores.\nOne last thing, try to use concurrency objects distributed with the system libraries - e.g in Java java.util.concurrent is your friend. Writing your own concurrency control objects is hard and fraught with danger; leave it to the experts, if you have a choice.\n", "open source - Software for Classical Music Theory / Composition / Harmony and Counterpoint": "\nBach-style 4 part harmony actually does follow some pretty rigid rules (no parallel 4ths, 5th or octaves, for example), and once you get your head around the rules it is a fairly trivial matter to harmonise a melody in four parts.

I can't imagine you would find papers on such a specific and simple case but perhaps for some of the techniques required, but an implementation of the backend should be relatively simple compared to a renderer.\nTo move the particles around a simple method is Euler iteration, where you store the positions and velocities. position = position + velocity*dt; where dt is the change in time since the last frame. It is best to keep dt fixed, and interpolate between points for the renderer if you can... this will reduce stability issues and make collision detection easier.\nTo reflect a particle off of a wall, check if its x components or y components of position will exceed the bounds and then flip the sign of the other component of the velocity, e.g.\nif(Math.Abs(position.x_component + velocity.x_component * dt) > x_bound) \n    velocity.y_component = -velocity.y_component;\n\nif(Math.Abs(position.y_component + velocity.y_component * dt) > y_bound)\n    velocity.x_component = -velocity.x_component;\n\nIf you have constant dt, this works quite well, but if it varies you will need to do something more complicated. find the collision point with the box and reflect the part of the vector outside the box in the face that was collided with.\nFor colliding the particles with each other a distance check is probably best, triggering reflection once the distance is too small. i.e. If they get too close they collide. Reflect the velocity components as though the particles were spheres, so the normal for reflection is the difference of their positions.\nYou may find this article on gamedev useful too...\nHope this helps.\n", "c# - How do I force formatting and calculations in a PDF when filling other fields using iTextSharp?": "\nPaulo Soares (one of the main devs of iText and current maintainer of iTextSharp) says:\n\niText doesn't do any effort to fix\n  calculated fields because most of the\n  times that's impossible.

Scheme (Lisp) helped here, as the syntax for a program is exactly the same as the syntax for lists in general, namely S-expressions.\nOnce you have the \"equivalence\" of code and data, suddenly a lot of things become easy.  For example, you can write programs that have different evaluation methods (lazy, nondeterministic, etc).  Previously, I might have thought that this would require an extension to the programming language; in reality, I can just add it on to the language myself, thus allowing the core language to be minimal.  As another example, you can similarly implement an object-oriented framework; again, this is something I might have naively thought would require modifying the language.\nIncidentally, one thing I wish SICP had mentioned more: types.

They seem to deal mostly in business issues and less on the technical/implementation specifics.\nThe simplest implementation is simply pointing to an image from another server. That server will identify on which site the advertisement is being displayed (from the 'Referer' header, or from an id or token passed with the image request). Then the image is returned and the pageview is recorded. If the viewer clicks on the ad, a link also pointing back to the ad server will record a 'clickthrough' and then forward the request on to the advertiser.\nThe database might look like this (drasticly oversimplified, for example only):\n\n\n    Pages\n    +---------+----------------+\n    | page_id | name           |\n    +---------+----------------+\n    |    1    | mycoolsite.com |\n    +---------+----------------+\n\n    Advertisements\n    +-----------------+------------------+--------------------------------+\n    |advertisement_id | image_name       | target_url                     |\n    +-----------------+------------------+--------------------------------+\n    |     1           |  banner1_468.png | http://new-amazing-product.com | \n    +-----------------+------------------+--------------------------------+\n\n    Activity\n    +--------------+--------------------+--------+--------+\n    | page_id      |  advertisement_id  | views  | clicks |\n    +--------------+--------------------+--------+--------+\n    |    1         |       1            |   0    |   0    |\n    +--------------+--------------------+--------+--------+\n\n\nIn the page which will display the add you'd put this in the html:\n<iframe src=\"http://your-ad-server.com/ads/image?site=1\" />\n\nWhen a user viewed the page, the request for the image would go to the ad-server.

As far as I remember, threading is not well defined in the servlet api (or Java EE or related areas. It might even be voluntarily and explicitly be non-defined.) Therefor it's not mandatory for the server to provide JNDI resources in threads that you've spawned yourself (again Websphere did bite me with this, I haven't tested Tomcat6 in this regard, earlier versions used to provide JNDI resources to all threads)\nYou've written that you are looking up JNDI resources from a singleton. If you, at the point of looking up resources, examine the stacktrace (either in your IDE, by throwing an exception or messing with Thread.currentThread().getStacktrace()): is there any Tomcat connector in the stacktrace or is one of your own Thread's run() method at the root of the stacktrace ? This would answer the question behind Jacks question if you are making the lookup from an Action class. (see Jack's answer)\nThreads and call-environment part two\nCreate a new Struts Action and call your JNDI lookup code from there, see if this works if placed as close to struts and within the processing of a http request. If it works here, continue with the steps above.\nvalidity of web.xml\nAlso, you might want to have a look at the schema definition for web.xml to make sure your resource-ref is positioned correctly. The servlet spec 2.4 is available at jcp.org and should be sufficient to check, even if tomcat implements 2.5.\nAfter all, I believe that tomcat6 validates web.xml, so that you probably already have it at the correct position. (Can't remember, as my IDEs editor complains when I get it wrong, should I need to write a web.xml)\nTomcat debug options\nMany context.xml entries honour the attribute 'debug'. Though I believe that low one-digit values are sufficient, I've adopted the habit to add 'debug=\"99\"' to elements like 'Context' or others. You might want to see if this results in some helpful log entries.\nMake sure it's not the classpath\nAs you seem to have fundamentally changed the environment, make sure that you have all required libraries on board - the mail api consists of several jars. Download a new copy and unpack all libraries to $CATALINA_HOME/lib. You might take unused away once it worked with all libraries in there.\nRegarding your classpath question:\nThe reason for finding the class when put into $CATALINA_HOME/lib is, that the connection is done by the server (remember - you've defined it in context.xml which is read by the server in order to start the application), thus the jar must be on the servers classpath - not just on the applications (see the tomcat class loader HOWTO for more information)\nEDIT:\nRegarding your partial solution:\n$CATALINA_HOME/conf/context.xml contains the global \"default\" context elements. This is not where you want your application specific configuration to be.\nThe standard position for tomcat is either in the webapps META-INF/context.xml or in an xml file (named as you like, ending .xml) in $CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/. The later solution is actually prefered with regards to META-INF/context.xml because this way the configuration is independent of the application and doesn't get overwritten when a new application is deployed.\nThis context usually contains additional attributes like docBase and path:\n<Context docBase=\"/location/where/you/deployed/your/application\" path=\"/app\">\n  ...\n</Context>\n\nThis way your application is available at http://servername:8080/app. If you deploy to the $CATALINA_HOME/webapps directory, the docBase value can be relative to webapp. Be careful with regards to race conditions though: Tomcat will autodeploy applications in $CATALINA_HOME/webapps and might create the context file. Also, deleting the webapp in order to deploy a new one might cause tomcat to delete the xml config file.\nTherefor - whatever your problem might be: Try if your context definition / application work when placed in $CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/app.xml .

In case the content is not really a file (e.g. if the user just selects text in an application and drags it onto your dock icon), the delegate method\n- (BOOL)applicationOpenUntitledFile:(NSApplication *)theApplication\n\nis called.\nSee NSApplication class reference\nBasically you can just create any object of any kind (e.g. a simple one that just inherits of NSObject), define the two methods of above within the object and then anywhere in your start up code of the app you do\nwhatever = [[YourObject alloc] init];\n[[NSApplication sharedApplication] setDelegate:whatever];\n\nAnd that's it. As soon as a file or some other content is dropped onto the dock icon, the appropriate method is called and must handle that request. BTW the same methods are called if your application associates with a file type (e.g. .myFileType) and the user double clicks a file with that extension in the Finder.\nWhat really happens behind the scenes is that Launch Services sends your \napplication an \"open documents\" ('odoc') Apple Event. NSApplication by default registers a handle for this event and forwards the request by calling the appropriate delegate method. You can also directly listen to this Apple Event I guess, but why would you? Dealing with Apple Events directly is awkward. When your application is not Cocoa, but Carbon (plain-C), you may have to directly process the Apple Event (I'm not familiar with Carbon), but in Cocoa Apple already catches the most important Apple Events for you and converts them into delegate calls or notifications your application can listen to.\n", "Problems with Excel automation in PowerShell": "\nYour logic seems to be fine, and this works for me (XP SP2 and PowerShell v2).\nJust before you call Save(), just for fun, add this line to see what gets printed:\n$Workbook|Get-Member *Save*\n\nI tried with a blank file.

What is important is that we can't use a usual copy constructor:\nA(A const& a) { \n    /* oops, a is const, we can't steal something from it! */ \n}\n\nBut if we change that to A(A &a), we won't be able to construct from a by-value/temporary A: Those can't be bound to a reference-to-nonconst:\nA(A &a) { \n\n}\n\n...\nA a = A(); // fail, because A &a = A() doesn't work\n\nauto_ptr and our A class uses the trick that non-const member functions can still be called on temporaries/by-value A's.

Since it's pretty much my\n\"invention\" (for better or worse), I might be able to help.\n\nInserted: The shortest possible\n  explanation I can make is that if\n  normal execution is like throwing a\n  ball in the air and catching it, then\n  differential execution is like\n  juggling.\n\n@windfinder's explanation is different from mine, and that's OK. This technique is not easy to wrap one's head around, and it's taken me some 20 years (off and on) to find explanations that work. Let me give it another shot here:\n\nWhat is it?\n\nWe all understand the simple idea of a computer stepping along through a program, taking conditional branches based on the input data, and doing things. (Assume we are dealing only with simple structured goto-less, return-less code.) That code contains sequences of statements, basic structured conditionals, simple loops, and subroutine calls. (Forget about functions returning values for now.)\nNow imagine two computers executing that same code in lock-step with each other, and able to compare notes. Computer 1 runs with input data A, and Computer 2 runs with input data B. They run step-by-step side by side. If they come to a conditional statement like IF(test) .... ENDIF, and if they have a difference of opinion on whether the test is true, then the one who says the test if false skips to the ENDIF and waits around for its sister to catch up. (This is why the code is structured, so we know the sister will eventually get to the ENDIF.)\nSince the two computers can talk to each other, they can compare notes and give a detailed explanation of how the two sets of input data, and execution histories, are different.\nOf course, in differential execution (DE) it is done with one computer, simulating two.\nNOW, suppose you only have one set of input data, but you want to see how it has changed from time 1 to time 2. Suppose the program you're executing is a serializer/deserializer. As you execute, you both serialize (write out) the current data and deserialize (read in) the past data (which was written the last time you did this). Now you can easily see what the differences are between what the data was last time, and what it is this time.\nThe file you are writing to, and the old file you are reading from, taken together constitute a queue or FIFO (first-in-first-out), but that's not a very deep concept.\n\nWhat is it good for?\n\nIt occurred to me while I was working on a graphics project, where the user could construct little display-processor routines called \"symbols\" that could be assembled into larger routines to paint things like diagrams of pipes, tanks, valves, stuff like that. We wanted to have the diagrams be \"dynamic\" in the sense that they could incrementally update themselves without having to redraw the entire diagram. (The hardware was slow by today's standards.) I realized that (for example) a routine to draw a bar of a bar-chart could remember its old height and just incrementally update itself.\nThis sounds like OOP, doesn't it? However, rather than \"make\" an \"object\", I could take advantage of the predictability of the execution sequence of the diagram procedure. I could write the bar's height in a sequential byte-stream. Then to update the image, I could just run the procedure in a mode where it sequentially reads its old parameters while it writes the new parameters so as to be ready for the next update pass.\nThis seems stupidly obvious and would seem to break as soon as the procedure contains a conditional, because then the new stream and the old stream would get out of sync. But then it dawned on me that if they also serialized the boolean value of the conditional test, they could get back in sync.\nIt took a while to convince myself, and then to prove, that this would always work, provided a simple rule (the \"erase mode rule\") is followed.\nThe net result is that the user could design these \"dynamic symbols\" and assemble them into larger diagrams, without ever having to worry about how they would dynamically update, no matter how complex or structurally variable the display would be.\nIn those days, I did have to worry about interference between visual objects, so that erasing one would not damage others. However, now I use the technique with Windows controls, and I let Windows take care of rendering issues.\nSo what does it achieve? It means I can build a dialog by writing a procedure to paint the controls, and I do not have to worry about actually remembering the control objects or dealing with incrementally updating them, or making them appear/disappear/move as conditions warrant. The result is much smaller and simpler dialog source code, by about an order of magnitude, and things like dynamic layout or altering the number of controls or having arrays or grids of controls are trivial. In addition, a control such as an Edit field can be trivially bound to the application data it is editing, and it will always be provably correct, and I never have to deal with its events. Putting in an edit field for an application string variable is a one-line edit.\n\nWhy is it hard to understand?\n\nWhat I have found hardest to explain is that it requires thinking differently about software. Programmers are so firmly wedded to the object-action view of software that they want to know what are the objects, what are the classes, how do they \"build\" the display, and how do they handle the events, that it takes a cherry bomb to blast them out of it. What I try to convey is that what really matters is what do you need to say? Imagine you are building a domain-specific language (DSL) where all you need to do is tell it \"I want to edit variable A here, variable B there, and variable C down there\" and it would magically take care of it for you. For example, in Win32 there is this \"resource language\" for defining dialogs. It is a perfectly good DSL, except it doesn't go far enough. It doesn't \"live in\" the main procedural language, or handle events for you, or contain loops/conditionals/subroutines. But it means well, and Dynamic Dialogs tries to finish the job.\nSo, the different mode of thinking is: to write a program, you first find (or invent) an appropriate DSL, and code as much of your program in that as possible. Let it deal with all the objects and actions that only exist for implementation's sake.\nIf you want to really understand differential execution and use it, there are a couple of tricky issues that can trip you up. I once coded it in Lisp macros, where these tricky bits could be handled for you, but in \"normal\" languages it requires some programmer discipline to avoid the pitfalls.\nSorry to be so long-winded.

Lines 1-6 define the \"database\". Lines 10-23 define the overall contents of the UI. Lines 30-48 define the controls for editing a single patient's record. Note the form of the program takes almost no notice of events in time, as if all it had to do was create the display once. Then, if subjects are added or removed or other structural changes take place, it is simply re-executed, as if it were being re-created from scratch, except that DE causes incremental update to take place instead. The advantage is that you the programmer do not have to give any attention or write any code to make the incremental updates of the UI happen, and they are guaranteed correct. It might seem that this re-execution would be a performance problem, but it is not, since updating controls that do not need to be changed takes on the order of tens of nanoseconds.\n1  class Patient {public:\n2    String name;\n3    double age;\n4    bool smoker; // smoker only relevant if age >= 50\n5  };\n6  vector< Patient* > patients;\n\n10 void deContents(){ int i;\n11   // First, have a label\n12   deLabel(200, 20, \u201cPatient name, age, smoker:\u201d);\n13   // For each patient, have a row of controls\n14   FOR(i=0, i<patients.Count(), i++)\n15     deEditOnePatient( P( patients[i] ) );\n16   END\n17   // Have a button to add a patient\n18   if (deButton(50, 20, \u201cAdd\u201d)){\n19     // When the button is clicked add the patient\n20     patients.Add(new Patient);\n21     DD_THROW;\n22   }\n23 }\n\n30 void deEditOnePatient(Patient* p){\n31   // Determine field widths\n32   int w = (Width()-50)/3;\n33   // Controls are laid out horizontally\n34   deStartHorizontal();\n35     // Have a button to remove this patient\n36     if (deButton(50, 20, \u201cRemove\u201d)){\n37       patients.Remove(p);\n37       DD_THROW;\n39     }\n40     // Edit fields for name and age\n41     deEdit(w, 20, P(&p->name));\n42     deEdit(w, 20, P(&p->age));\n43     // If age >= 50 have a checkbox for smoker boolean\n44     IF(p->age >= 50)\n45       deCheckBox(w, 20, \u201cSmoker?\u201d, P(&p->smoker));\n46     END\n47   deEndHorizontal(20);\n48 }\n\nAdded: Brian asked a good question, and I thought the answer belonged in the main text here:\n@Mike: I'm not clear on what the \"if (deButton(50, 20, \u201cAdd\u201d)){\" statement is actually doing. What does the deButton function do? Also, are your FOR/END loops using some sort of macro or something? \u2013 Brian.\n@Brian: Yes, the FOR/END and IF statements are macros. The SourceForge project has a complete implementation. deButton maintains a button control. When any user input action takes place, the code is run in \"control event\" mode, in which deButton detects that it was pressed and signifies that it was pressed by returning TRUE. Thus, the \"if(deButton(...)){... action code ...} is a way of attaching action code to the button, without having to create a closure or write an event handler. The DD_THROW is a way of terminating the pass when the action is taken because the action may have modified application data, so it is invalid to continue the \"control event\" pass through the routine. If you compare this to writing event handlers, it saves you writing those, and it lets you have any number of controls.\nAdded: Sorry, I should explain what I mean by the word \"maintains\". When the procedure is first executed (in SHOW mode), deButton creates a button control and remembers its id in the FIFO. On subsequent passes (in UPDATE mode), deButton gets the id from the FIFO, modifies it if necessary, and puts it back in the FIFO. In ERASE mode, it reads it from the FIFO, destroys it, and does not put it back, thereby \"garbage collecting\" it. So the deButton call manages the entire lifetime of the control, keeping it in agreement with application data, which is why I say it \"maintains\" it.\nThe fourth mode is EVENT (or CONTROL). When the user types a character or clicks a button, that event is caught and recorded, and then the deContents procedure is executed in EVENT mode. deButton gets the id of its button control from the FIFO and askes if this is the control that was clicked. If it was, it returns TRUE so the action code can be executed. If not, it just returns FALSE. On the other hand, deEdit(..., &myStringVar) detects if the event was meant for it, and if so passes it to the edit control, and then copies the contents of the edit control to myStringVar. Between this and normal UPDATE processing, myStringVar always equals the contents of the edit control. That is how \"binding\" is done. The same idea applies to scroll bars, list boxes, combo boxes, any kind of control that lets you edit application data.\nHere's a link to my Wikipedia edit: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:MikeDunlavey/Difex_Article\n", "How do autocomplete suggestions work?": "\n\nWhat technology behind 'em?\n\nIn case you are wondering which data structure is being used underneath then its called \"trie\" and for using less space compared to tries you can use \"DAFSA\"\n\nHow do they work?\n\nboth are implemented as a tree, where each node of tree corresponds to one character in a string and the character which appears before is parent of character which appears later e.g. The strings \"tap\", \"taps\", \"top\", and \"tops\" stored in a Trie (left) and a DAFSA (right),so as you begin to type tap..the tree is traversed based on the characters typed and shows the suggestions based on some weight assigned to each word, weight may be assigned based on usage frequency of the word.\n \nLooking up string in worst case is O(m) time where m is the length of string.\nImage is being referenced from the wikipedia articel : DAFSA,trie\n", "c# - No Nodes Selected from Atom XML document using XPath?": "\nWhile the C# implementation may allow default namespaces (I don't know), the XPath 1.0 spec doesn't.

Anyway the design I've come up with so far looks something like this:\n\nYou can't possibly store all the instances of a recurring event, at least not before they occur, so I simply have one table that stores the first instance of the event as an actual date, an optional expiration, and nullable repeat_unit and repeat_increment fields to describe the repetition. For single instances the repition fields are null, otherwise the units will be 'day', 'week', 'month', 'year' and increment is simply the multiple of units to add to start date for the next occurrence.\nStoring past events only seems advantageous if you need to establish relationships with other entities in your model, and even then it's not necessary to have an explicit \"event instance\" table in every case. If the other entities already have date/time \"instance\" data then a foreign key to the event (or join table for a many-to-many) would most likely be sufficient.\nTo do \"change this instance\"/\"change all future instances\", I was planning on just duplicating the events and expiring the stale ones. So to change a single instances, you'd expire the old one at it's last occurrence, make a copy for the new, unique occurrence with the changes and without any repetition, and another copy of the original at the following occurrence that repeats into the future. Changing all future instances is similar, you would just expire the original and make a new copy with the changes and repition details.\n\nThe two problems I see with this design so far are:\n\nIt makes MWF-type events hard to represent. It's possible, but forces the user to create three separate events that repeat weekly on M,W,F individually, and any changes they want to make will have to be done on each one separately as well. These kind of events aren't particularly useful in my app, but it does leave a wart on the model that makes it less universal than I'd like.\nBy copying the events to make changes, you break the association between them, which could be useful in some scenarios (or, maybe it would just be occasionally problematic.) The event table could theoretically contain a \"copied_from\" id field to track where an event originated, but I haven't fully thought through how useful something like that would be. For one thing, parent/child hierarchical relationships are a pain to query from SQL, so the benefits would need to be pretty heavy to outweigh the cost for querying that data. You could use a nested-set instead, I suppose.\n\nLastly I think it's possible to compute events for a given timespan using straight SQL, but I haven't worked out the exact details and I think the queries usually end up being too cumbersome to be worthwhile. However for the sake of argument, you can use the following expression to compute the difference in months between the given month and year an event:\n(:month + (:year * 12)) - (MONTH(occursOn) + (YEAR(occursOn) * 12))\n\nBuilding on the last example, you could use MOD to determine whether difference in months is the correct multiple:\nMOD(:month + (:year * 12)) - (MONTH(occursOn) + (YEAR(occursOn) * 12), repeatIncrement) = 0\n\nAnyway this isn't perfect (it doesn't ignore expired events, doesn't factor in start / end times for the event, etc), so it's only meant as a motivating example. Generally speaking though I think most queries will end up being too complicated. You're probably better off querying for events that occur during a given range, or don't expire before the range, and computing the instances themselves in code rather than SQL. If you really want the database to do the processing then a stored procedure would probably make your life a lot easier.\n", "python - \"EOL while scanning single-quoted string\"?

This is an easy mistake to make.\nI am assuming you are using a Prefork Apache, and an in-process application server (such as PHP or mod_perl). In this model, you will end up with a maximum of (MaxClients * max memory usage of your application per process) memory used. If you don't have nearly that much, it's time to decrease one, the other or both.\nIn the general case, this means decreasing MaxClients to the point where your server has enough ram to cope.\nThe default values typically used for MaxClients (150 is typical) are not suitable for running an in-process heavyweight application server on a modest machine if you are using the Prefork model (Most application servers either don't support, or discourage, the use of threaded models).\nHowever, decreasing MaxClients will eventually cause the application to become unavailable, particularly if you have keepalives on and the keepalive timeout too long. Processes which are just keeping a connection alive (state K in server-status) still use a lot of RAM, and that may be a problem - try to minimise keepalive timeout, or turn it off altogether.\nYou need to keep an eye on server-status (as provided by mod_status).\nOf course you should only make ANY of these changes if you understand the consequences.

At my last job, we ran into some real issues with Runtime exceptions being forgotten until they showed up in production (on agedwards.com), so we resolved to use checked exceptions exclusively.\nAt my current job, I find that there are many who are for Runtime exceptions in many or all cases.\nHere's what I think:  Using CheckedExceptions, I am forced at compile time to at least acknowledge the exception in the caller.  With Runtime exceptions, I am not forced to by the compiler, but can write a unit test that makes me deal with it.  Since I still believe that the earlier a bug is caught the cheaper it is to fix it, I prefer CheckedExceptions for this reason.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, a method call is a contract to some degree between the caller and the called.  Since the compiler enforces the types of parameters that are passed in, it seems symmetrical to let it enforce the types on the way out.  That is, return values or exceptions.\nMy experience tells me that I get higher quality, that is, code that JUST WORKS, when I'm using checked exceptions.  Checked exceptions may clutter code, but there are techniques to deal with this.  I like to translate exceptions when passing a layer boundary.  For example, if I'm passing up from my persistence layer, I would like to convert an SQL exception to a persistence exception, since the next layer up shouldn't care that I'm persisting to a SQL database, but will want to know if something could not be persisted.  Another technique I use is to create a simple hierarchy of exceptions.  This lets me write cleaner code one layer up, since I can catch the superclass, and only deal with the individual subclasses when it really matters.\n", "Abstract and title together on the first page of an article - TeX - LaTeX Stack Exchange": "\nAs explained earlier, the titlepage class option uses the titlepage environment to typeset title (\\maketitle) and abstract (abstract-environment), which leads to a new page being issued.

It was done for a java development team using various java IDE tools.  The result wasn't regarded as a success, and the company brought the team back into a central London office at considerable expense.\nFor someone doing this on a day-in day-out basis on interactive software, the result isn't really very pleasant.  For something that mainly uses text-based tools such as vim and unix command line tools, it works somewhat better.  At one point I had XVNC going over a 128 Kbit DSL link (of a type that was prevalent in New Zealand at the time) and could do work on an Oracle-based data warehouse at a remote location quite readily.  The level of interactivity required by the tooling made them much less sensitive to the slow link than a Windows-based IDE.\nSo, I'll invoke the 'it depends' argument with some qualifications:\n\nI would not recommend it for a modern IDE, and certainly not for something heavily graphical like Dreamweaver, BI Development Studio or Informatica.\nFor a textual environment like traditional unix development tools it could probably be made to work quite well.  These user interfaces are much less sensitive to latency than a direct-manipulation user interface.\n\nI'm something of a believer in the 'best tools' principle.  Going out of your way to give a second-rate user interface to a development team will give off negative signals. The cost saving from doing this is likely to be minimal and it will annoy some of your team members.

You may have to sign something stating you would not use an administrative access on your machine to install illegal software, but you'd still get admin.\nIn the few cases I have gone for job interviews (I'm mostly in academia but worked some in the industry), one of my greatest concerns was the amount of control I had about my computing environment, from hardware, to software, to administrative rights.

If no applicable method is\n  found during this phase then\n  processing continues to the second\n  phase.\n\nIf you don't cast it explicitly, it will go to the second phase of trying to find a matching method, allowing autoboxing, and then it is indeed ambiguous, because your second argument can be matched by boolean or Object. \n\nThe second phase (\u00a715.12.2.3) performs\n  overload resolution while allowing\n  boxing and unboxing, but still\n  precludes the use of variable arity\n  method invocation.\n\nWhy, in the second phase, doesn't the compiler choose the second method because no autoboxing of the boolean argument is necessary? Because after it has found the two matching methods, only subtype conversion is used to determine the most specific method of the two, regardless of any boxing or unboxing that took place to match them in the first place (\u00a715.12.2.5).\nAlso: the compiler can't always choose the most specific method based on the number of auto(un)boxing needed. It can still result in ambiguous cases. For example, this is still ambiguous:\npublic class Test {\n    static void f(Object a, boolean b) {}\n    static void f(int a, Object b) {}\n\n    static void m(int a, boolean b) { f(a, b); } // ambiguous\n}\n\nRemember that the algorithm for choosing a matching method (compile-time step 2) is fixed and described in the JLS. Once in phase 2 there is no selective autoboxing or unboxing. The compiler will locate all the methods that are accessible (both methods in these cases) and applicable (again the two methods), and only then chooses the most specific one without looking at boxing/unboxing, which is ambiguous here.\n", "php - Integrating iCalendar in Moodle": "\nOn moodle.org, there is a change request for this feature in the Moodle Tracker that you might want to follow:\nCalendar: IMPORT or Subscribe to iCal feed into Moodle calendar\n.\n", "replacing regex in java string, which contains `&#xA;` symbol": "\nI'm not 100% sure how the java regex-engine works, but I can't possibly imagine that an entity would cause your problems.

That way you can track occurrences in one place.  \n1) Connection : monitor your internet connectivity from the server and from the outside.  Log this somewhere\n2) Server : monitor all the processes that you need to to ensure they are running and not pinning the server.  Use a HP Server or something equivalent with hardware failure notification that it can do from a bios level.  Notify and log if they are.\n3) Software : Identify the key software that always needs to be running. Set the performance levels if any and then monitor them.  Nagios should be able to help with this.  On windows it can be a bit more.  When an exception occurs, you should be able to run a script from it to restart processes automatically.  My dream system is allowing me to interact with servers via SMS if the server sees it as an exception that I have to either permit, or one that will happen automatically unless I cancel by sms.  One day..\n4) Remote Power : Ensure Remote power-reset capabilities are in your hand.  You might want to schedule weekly reboots if you ever use windows for anything.\n5) Business Logic Testing : Have regularly running scripts testing the workflow of your system.  Selenium can probably achieve some of this, but I like logging the results as well to say this ran at this time and these files had errors.   If possible anywhere, have the system monitor itself through your scripts.\n6) Backups : Make a backup that you can set and forget.

All the other threads in your process would be in an indeterminate state,  How would you synchronize with them?   Remember, the idea is that the process needs to be killed. \nThe other scenario is even tougher: your code is benign and trying to do the right thing - e.g. clean up and be a good system citizen.   Some code isn't.  Imagine what a boon to a malware author it would be if the OS allowed code to be run for a process that was being killed.   It would be bad enough for malicious processes that were running with standard user privileges, and completely awful for any running with administrative privileges.\nCritical finalizes and structured exception handling will not solve this fundamental issue.  \nON the upside, the OS will free all the resources it knows about when your process is killed, namely memory and kernel objects.  Those will not leak.  But explorer doesn't know about your process so it cannot clean up for it. \nOne way to solve this would be to have a monitoring process that keeps track of your other processes state and cleans up for it.

On early 1970s machines, single precision was significantly more efficient and as today, used half as much memory as double precision.  Hence it was a reasonable default for floating-point numbers.\nlong double was added much later when the IEEE standard made allowances for the Intel 80287 floating-point chip, which used 80-bit floating-point numbers instead of the classic 64-bit double precision.\nQuestioner is incorrect about guarantees; today almost all languages guarantee to implement IEEE 754 binary floating-point numbers at single precision (32 bits) and double precision (64 bits).  Some also offer extended precision (80 bits), which shows up in C as long double.  The IEEE floating-point standard, spearheaded by William Kahan, was a triumph of good engineering over expediency: on the machines of the day, it looked prohibitively expensive, but on today's machines it is dirt cheap, and the portability and predictability of IEEE floating-point numbers must save gazillions of dollars every year.\n", "What programming language would be best for creating a roguelike game?": "\nWay back in the day I tried to write Roguelike games using QuickBASIC out of all things (it was 1988.)

But Rapid Deployment?\nMy concern is that you are looking at the daily builds in the wrong way.  The dailies do NOT need to be widely deployed.  In fact, QA and Development are the only ones who should care about the builds on a day to day basis.  EVen then, the devs shouldn't be out of sync ;).  \nThe customer team should only recieve builds at the end of a iteration.  That is where you show them what you have done and they provide feedback and you move forward from there.  Giving them daily builds could cause a vicious thrashing that would kill your velocity.\nAll that being said, a nice deployment package might be good for QA.  But again, it depends on how in step they are with your development iterations.  My experience, right or wrong, is that QA is one iteration back testing the deliverables from the last iteration.  From that point of view, they should be testing with the last \"stable\" release as well.\n", "Using Emacs as an IDE": "\nYou'll have to be specific as to what you mean by \"the rest\".  Except for the object inspector (that I\"m aware of), emacs does all the above quite easily:\n\neditor (obvious)\ncompiler - just run M-x compile and enter your compile command.  From there on, you can just M-x compile and use the default.  Emacs will capture C/C++ compiler errors (works best with GCC) and help you navigate to lines with warnings or errors.\nDebugging - similarly, when you want to debug, type M-x gdb and it will create a gdb buffer with special bindings\nDocumentation Lookup - emacs has excellent CScope bindings for code navigation.

You don't get to tell it what the concrete types of your domain model objects are. You only get to tell it what the base types and interfaces are. Then it gets to choose how to implement the domain types efficiently.\nFor example, NHibernate uses its own internal implementation of IList<T> that knows how to do lazy loading.\nMoreover, NHibernate uses its own internal implementation of Building from your domain model. It is not necessarily the case that all the Building objects you will be using with NHibernate will have, as their concrete type, Building. It is only true that they will be Buildings, whether Building is the concrete type of your object, or whether it is the base type of the concrete type of your object.\nBut this is the right thing to do, since you are supposed to be using interfaces and base types instead of concrete types anyway. NHibernate helps you use all the right approaches to programming.\nNow, why do you need a List<Building> per se? Why will IList<Building> not suffice?\n", "Java maximum memory on Windows XP": "\nKeep in mind that Windows has virtual memory management and the JVM only needs memory that is contiguous in its address space. So, other programs running on the system shouldn't necessarily impact your heap size. What will get in your way are DLL's that get loaded in to your address space. Unfortunately optimizations in Windows that minimize the relocation of DLL's during linking make it more likely you'll have a fragmented address space. Things that are likely to cut in to your address space aside from the usual stuff include security software, CBT software, spyware and other forms of malware. Likely causes of the variances are different security patches, C runtime versions, etc. Device drivers and other kernel bits have their own address space (the other 2GB of the 4GB 32-bit space).\nYou could try going through your DLL bindings in your JVM process and look at trying to rebase your DLL's in to a more compact address space. Not fun, but if you are desperate...\nAlternatively, you can just switch to 64-bit Windows and a 64-bit JVM. Despite what others have suggested, while it will chew up more RAM, you will have much more contiguous virtual address space, and allocating 2GB contiguously would be trivial.\n", "performance - Can I use a RAM disk to speed up my IDE?": "\nHonestly, if you have Vista/Windows Server 2008 x64 and you jam your workstation with 4 to 8 GB of RAM, for most tasks, everything will be in cache or stored by SuperFetch, which will be a lot easier to manage and just about as high performance as a RAM disk.  The RAM disk won't do a thing for you if you're starving your other system RAM to make it work.\nBTW, I tried your suggestion a couple of years ago.  While it technically worked, copying the necessary data to the RAM disk on every boot took too long and was a pain.\n", "Dynamically adding a form to a Django formset": "\nThis is how I do it, using jQuery:\nMy template:\n<h3>My Services</h3>\n{{ serviceFormset.management_form }}\n{% for form in serviceFormset.forms %}\n    <div class='table'>\n    <table class='no_error'>\n        {{ form.as_table }}\n    </table>\n    </div>\n{% endfor %}\n<input type=\"button\" value=\"Add More\" id=\"add_more\">\n<script>\n    $('#add_more').click(function() {\n        cloneMore('div.table:last', 'service');\n    });\n</script>\n\nIn a javascript file:\nfunction cloneMore(selector, type) {\n    var newElement = $(selector).clone(true);\n    var total = $('#id_' + type + '-TOTAL_FORMS').val();\n    newElement.find(':input').each(function() {\n        var name = $(this).attr('name').replace('-' + (total-1) + '-','-' + total + '-');\n        var id = 'id_' + name;\n        $(this).attr({'name': name, 'id': id}).val('').removeAttr('checked');\n    });\n    newElement.find('label').each(function() {\n        var newFor = $(this).attr('for').replace('-' + (total-1) + '-','-' + total + '-');\n        $(this).attr('for', newFor);\n    });\n    total++;\n    $('#id_' + type + '-TOTAL_FORMS').val(total);\n    $(selector).after(newElement);\n}\n\nWhat it does:\ncloneMore accepts selector as the first argument, and the type of formset as the 2nd one. What the selector should do is pass it what it should duplicate. In this case, I pass it div.table:last so that jQuery looks for the last table with a class of table. The :last part of it is important because the selector is also used to determine what the new form will be inserted after. More than likely you'd want it at the end of the rest of the forms. The type argument is so that we can update the management_form field, notably TOTAL_FORMS, as well as the actual form fields. If you have a formset full of, say, Client models, the management fields will have IDs of id_clients-TOTAL_FORMS and id_clients-INITIAL_FORMS, while the form fields will be in a format of id_clients-N-fieldname with N being the form number, starting with 0. So with the type argument the cloneMore function looks at how many forms there currently are, and goes through every input and label inside the new form replacing all the field names/ids from something like id_clients-(N)-name to id_clients-(N+1)-name and so on. After it is finished, it updates the TOTAL_FORMS field to reflect the new form and adds it to the end of the set.\nThis function is particularly helpful to me because the way it is setup it allows me to use it throughout the app when I want to provide more forms in a formset, and doesn't make me need to have a hidden \"template\" form to duplicate as long as I pass it the formset name and the format in which the forms are laid out. Hope it helps.\n", "Progress bar using Office VBA": "\nI don't think there's any built-in way to make a form stay on top in VBA, but one question is are you calling DoEvents when you're updating anything on your form?

That way you can make links without having to know the exact title of a target page, and bouncing on the shift key to WriteInCamelCase, or throwing in square brackets. Make it very easy to link to other websites outside the wiki, too (and by \"easy\" I do not mean like wikisisters, which, if I remember correctly, is like foowiki:ALinkLikeThis).\nSimilarly, if you can generate links within text automatically, you could, for example, have a mail system that wikifies your email. You create a wiki page, say, for Joel Spolsky, and references to Joel emails in your inbox become links to that page, which you can find by clicking \"what links here\". (This probably needs something along the lines of Bayesian filtering to prune the stray references to other Joels... your Bayesian Classifier learns that if the context is smart and getting things done, it's Spolsky.

Only if you can safely predict that you can stick tight to the model web forms was designed to handle, work within the out-of-the-box pattern, and do not care much about testability, would I recommend web forms.\nThe only other scenario where web forms might make sense is if you have a team of people highly ingrained with this technology and want to keep inline with existing application stacks. Even then, for the growth of your developers and long-term product maintenance (post transition), I still recommend MVC if you can swing it.\nThat said, Microsoft will probably continue to support the web forms model for some time and eventually the two models will probably become easier and easier to plug and play or interchange with one another (based on conversations I have had with a couple of the ASP.NET team's program managers).\n", ".net - Caselessly comparing strings in C#": "\nThe main thing you should be concerned about isn't performance, it's correctness, and from that aspect the method you probably want to be using for a case insensitive comparison is either:\nstring.Compare(a, b, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) == 0;\n\nor\na.Equals(b, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)\n\n(The first one is useful if you know the strings may be null; the latter is simpler to write if you already know that at least one string is non-null.

She tried to be polite but pretty soon I could tell she had no idea what I was going on about. She was a forecast analyst and was using a SAS forecast tool that had a GUI on top which she was learning to use. I soon realized that when people talk about using SAS it is about as specific as 'using Microsoft.' So it is worth brushing up on the suite of SAS BI tools, Data Mining tools, etc. I think they all have SAS language underneath them, but don't assume someone is talking about SAS programming just 'cause they say 'SAS.'\n", "linux - What are some good resources for learning network programming?": "\nUnix network programming by Richard Stevens is a must-have book which discusses many advanced network programming techniques.

I wrote a row-count program for a binary (length-prefixed rather than delimited) bcp output file once and ended up having to redo it in C because the python one was too slow.  This program was quite small (it only took a couple of days to re-write it in C), so I didn't bother to try and build a hybrid application (python glue with central routines written in C) but this would also have been a viable route.\nA larger application with performance critical bits can be written in a combination of C and a higher level language.  You can write the performance-critical parts in C with an interface to Python for the rest of the system.  SWIG, Pyrex or Boost.Python (if you're using C++) all provide good mechanisms to do the plumbing for your Python interface.  The C API for python is more complex than that for Tcl or Lua, but isn't infeasible to build by hand.  For an example of a hand-built Python/C API, check out cx_Oracle.\nThis approach has been used on quite a number of successful applications going back as far as the 1970s (that I am aware of).  Mozilla was substantially written in Javascript around a core engine written in C.  Several CAD packages, Interleaf (a technical document publishing system) and of course EMACS are substantially written in LISP with a central C, assembly language or other core.  Quite a few commercial and open-source applications (e.g. Chandler or Sungard Front Arena) use embedded Python interpreters and implement substantial parts of the application in Python.\nEDIT: In rsponse to Dutch Masters' comment, keeping someone with C or C++ programming skills on the team for a Python project gives you the option of writing some of the application for speed.  The areas where you can expect to get a significant performance gain are where the application does something highly iterative over a large data structure or large volume of data.  In the case of the row-counter above it had to inhale a series of files totalling several gigabytes and go through a process where it read a varying length prefix and used that to determine the length of the data field.  Most of the fields were short (just a few bytes long).  This was somewhat bit-twiddly and very low level and iterative, which made it a natural fit for C.\nMany of the python libraries such as numpy, cElementTree or cStringIO make use of an optimised C or FORTRAN core with a python API that facilitates working with data in aggregate.  For example, numpy has matrix data structures and operations written in C which do all the hard work and a Python API that provides services at the aggregate level.\n", "javascript - Can the jQuery UI Datepicker be made to disable Saturdays and Sundays (and holidays)?": "\nThere is the beforeShowDay option, which takes a function to be called for each date, returning true if the date is allowed or false if it is not.

In OpenGL that's PBO (Pixel Buffer Object) extension or good old glTexSubImage* function. In D3D9 it's LockRect on the texture or other ways (e.g. LockRect on a scratch texture, then blit into a GPU texture). Any of those would potentially use DMA, but you can't be sure.\nThen the data is in a texture. You can render it to a screen with some shaders (e.g. doing YCbCr conversion), or render into other texture(s) to do more complex processing effects (e.g. blur/glow/...).\nUsing Direct3D is easier in a sense that there are clearly defined \"wast ways\" of doing stuff.

Since many of these activities need elevated permissions the install may be performed by the administrator, while the application can be used by all users.\nThere may actually be requirements for a scriptable installation procedure in corporate environments.\nNot having an installer opens the way to portable applications. If the program has everything in a directory, then this can simply be copied to a USB stick and be run on any system. This may of course not make sense for your particular kind of app, but that is for you to decide.\n\nI'm not sure that the issue about corrupted settings is really important here. If settings are corrupted (why?) - how is the application to know what to do about it? OTOH the installer can of course also be written to not blindly overwrite any old settings. It all depends...\nEdit: You write in your comment:\n\nEven portable apps require certain configuration/settings, Isn't it better to have the main app check that settings are valid/exist on each startup, and only prompt the user when needed.\n\nand again, it really depends on your needs. There are different types of configuration settings or preferences, and you have to decide individually:\n\nPer-user configuration settings will be missing if the application is run for the first time by the current user. It can be helpful to show a message that it is missing, and how to create it. For example in FlameRobin (a database administration program for Firebird) we have a message that is shown when no registered servers and databases are found on program startup, and how to register them.\nPer-user settings for UI behaviour will also be missing, but there are default values for them. The user will get the default behaviour of the application, and can later change things in the option dialog. Since it is best to minimize the number of such settings, and since the defaults should be what most users expect or what works best in the general case, there is also no need to bother the user at program startup.\nSome configuration may be not per-user, but per-program. This is generally stored in a location where standard users have no write access, so checking for this and prompt the user to enter it is not really helpful. What could be done is to start an external program, asking the standard user for the account with sufficient privileges and its password.\n\n", "cocoa - Multiple custom controls that use mouseMoved in one window": "\nYou will also need to override -acceptsFirstResponder to return YES.\n\n    #pragma mark NSResponder Overrides\n    - (BOOL)acceptsFirstResponder\n    {\n    return YES;\n    }\n\n\n-mouseMoved events are expensive so I turn off mouse moved events when my control's -mouseExited message is called and I turn it on in -mouseEntered.\n\n    - (void)mouseEntered:(NSEvent *)theEvent\n{\n    [[self window] setAcceptsMouseMovedEvents:YES];\n    [[self window] makeFirstResponder:self];\n}\n\n- (void)mouseMoved:(NSEvent *)theEvent\n{\n...\n}\n\n- (void)mouseExited:(NSEvent *)theEvent\n{\n    [[self window] setAcceptsMouseMovedEvents:NO];\n}\n\nI quickly tested this in my custom control application.

Once compiled they cease to associate in any way, shape, or form with the language they were compiled in and are merely binary executables.  (there are artifacts taht may show what language it was compiled from, but that isn't the point here)\nSo once compiled, they are associated to the machine (X86, the intel and amd instruction set and architecture) and the OS.\nThis is why they can run on any compatible x86 machine, and any compatible OS (win95 through winvista, for some software).\nHowever, they cannot run on an OSX machine, even if it's running on an intel processor - the binary isn't compatible unless you run additional emulation software (such as parallels, or a VM with windows).\nBeyond that, if you want to run them on an ARM processor, or MIPS, or PowerPC, then you have to run a full machine instruction set emulator that interprets the binary machine code from X86 into whatever machine you're running it on.\nContrast that with .NET.\nThe .NET virtual machine is fabricated as though there were much better processors out in the world - processors that understand objects, memory allocation and garbage collection, and other high level constructs.  It's a very complex machine and can't be built directly in silicon now (with good performance) but an emulator can be written that will allow it to run on any existing processor.\nSuddenly you can write one machine specific emulator for any processor you want to run .NET on, and then ANY .NET program can run on it.  No need to worry about the OS or the underlying CPU architecture - if there's a .NET VM, then the software will run.\nBut let's go a bit further - once you have this common language, why not make compilers that convert any other written language into it?\nSo now you can have a C, C#, C++, Java, javascript, Basic, python, lua, or any other language compiler that converts written code so it'll run on this virtual machine.\nYou've disassociated the machine from the language by 2 degrees, and with not too much work you enable anyone to write any code and have it run on any machine, as long as a compiler and a VM exists to map the two degrees of separation.\nIf you're still wondering why this is a good thing, consider early DOS machines, and what Microsoft's real contribution to the world was:\nAutocad had to write drivers for each printer they could print to.  So did lotus 1-2-3.  In fact, if you wanted your software to print, you had to write your own drivers.  If there were 10 printers, and 10 programs, then 100 different pieces of essentially the same code had to be written separately and independently. \nWhat windows 3.1 tried to accomplish (along with GEM, and so many other abstraction layers) is make it so the printer manufacturer wrote one driver for their printer, and the programmer wrote one driver for the windows printer class.  \nNow with 10 programs and 10 printers, only 20 pieces of code have to be written, and since the microsoft side of the code was the same for everyone, then examples from MS meant that you had very little work to do.\nNow a program wasn't restricted to just the 10 printers they chose to support, but all the printers whose manufacturers provided drivers for in windows.\nThe same issue is occurring in application development.  There are really neat applications I can't use because I don't use a MAC.  There is a ton of duplication (how many world class word processors do we really need?).\nJava was meant to fix this, but it had many limitations, some of which aren't really solved.\n.NET is closer, but no one is developing world-class VMs for platforms other than Windows (mono is so close... and yet not quite there).\nSo...  That's why we need VMs.  Because I don't want to limit myself to a smaller audience simply because they chose an OS/machine combination different from my own.\n-Adam\n", "Mercurial and a sort of Continuous Integration workflow for Java project": "\nWhat you're looking for is called a Partial Clone and it isn't supported in mercurial.\nHonestly, your workflow sounds pretty broken -- creating a subset repo and trying to keep it in sync is fighting against how the tools were intended to be used.

C# and C++/CLI were definitely slower than C++, even with pointers, I haven't been able to get above 10 frames per second with those languages. As soon as I switched to C++, I got something like 15-20 frames per second instantly. A few more clever changes and SSE got me up to 40 frames per second.

It's almost as good as sliced bread. :)   \nEDIT:\nThere are no set methods for ResultSet, while there are Update methods. The problem with using the Update method's for the purpose of rebuilding a ResultSet is that it requires selecting a Row to update. Once the ResultSet has freed itself, all rows are set to null. A null reference cannot be called. A List of Lists mimics a ResultSet itself, or more correctly, an array of arrays mimic a ResultSet.   \nWhile Vectors are thread safe, there is a huge overhead attached to them. Use the ArrayList instead. As each nested List is created and placed into the outer nest List, insert it in this manner.\nnest.add(Collections.unmodifiableList(nested));\n\nAfter all of the nested Lists are inserted, return the nest List as an umodifiableList as well. This will give you a thread-safe collection without the overhead of the vectors.  \n", "vmware - Carrying and Working on an Entire Development Box from a USB Stick.

Also copying my 4GB VM off and back onto the drive was also quite slow - about 10 minutes to copy it onto the drive.\nIf you have an esata port I'd highly recommend looking at high-speed ESata options like this Kanguru 32GB ESata/USB Flash drive OR this 32GB one by OCZ.\nThe read and write speeds of these drives are much higher over ESata than other USB drives. And you can still use them as USB if you don't have an ESata port. Though if you don't have an ESata port you can buy PCI to ESata cards online and even ESata ExpressCards for your laptop.\nEDIT: A side note, you'll find the USB flash drives use FAT instead of NTFS. You don't want to use NTFS because it makes a lot more reads & writes on the disk and your drive will only have a limited number of reads & writes before it dies. But by using FAT you'll be limited to max 2GB file size which might be a problem with your VM. If this is the case, you can split your VM disks into 2GB chunks.

Let's say that when the user clicks the tab you want the handle_tab_click() function to fire. Here's an example of binding the onclick event to your my_tab tab:\n$(\".my_tab\").bind(\"click\", handle_tab_click);\n\nYour handle_tab_click() function will be given an event argument which will be able to provide you with information on the element that fired the event (in this case, the element with class name my_tab).\nfunction (event) {\n    if ($(event.target).hasClass(\"my_tab\")) { /* handle tab click */ }\n    if ($(event.target).hasClass(\"my_tab_2\")) { /* a different tab click */ }\n    if ($(event.target).hasClass(\"my_tab_3\")) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\nSee the JQuery event documentation for more details here.\nFetching the data via ajax\nFetching data will require you to invoke a remote script while supplying information about which tab was clicked (in order to fetch the appropriate information). In the following snippet, we're invoking the remote script myscript.php, supplying the HTTP GET argument tab_clicked=my_tab and calling the function tab_fetch_cb when the script returns.  The final parameter is the type of data being returned (it's up to you to choose).\n$.get(\"myscript.php\", {tab_clicked, \"my_tab\"}, tab_fetch_cb, \"text/json/xml\")\n\nIt's up to you to design myscript.php to handle the tab_clicked parameter, fetch the appropriate data and return it (i.e. write it back out to the client).\nHere's an example for tab_fetch_cb:\nfunction tab_fetch_cb(data, status) {\n    // populate your newly opened tab with information \n    // returned from myscript.php here\n}\n\nYou can read more about the JQuery get function here, and JQuery ajax functions here\nI'm sorry I can't be more specific in my examples, but a lot of the processing is really dependant on your task.

Whenever you need a break from coding, hit M-x info and pick a random page to read.  Your emacs ability will improve incredibly quickly.\nIt is also important to realize how emacs' self-documenting-ness helps you work.  Say, for example, you are wondering how you can scale the font size.  Instead of interrupting your flow and asking here, or on IRC, or Google, you can ask emacs!  Just hit C-h a (M-x command-apropos) and type a search term, in our case scale.  If there are matching functions, their names, keybindings, and documentation will appear.  There are, and now you've just discovered text-scale-increase and text-scale-decrease.\nThere are other self-documentation functions that are good to learn C-h m will tell you what keybindings and commands are available in the current major and minor modes.  This is a great way to discover features you didn't know existed.\nAnother way to \"learn by osmosis\" is to M-x customize-group for the modes you use regularly.  (customize is the interactive configuration editor that almost all modes support.)\nThe final thing to do is to learn Emacs Lisp.  It is nice to use existing tools, but sometimes you will need your own.  If you try to avoid learning Lisp, you will always be stuck with things not quite working right, and that's a shame.  \nEmacs is a great environment for customizing itself.  Emacs includes two Lisp manuals that are viewable via M-x info.  It is self-documenting, so you can say C-h f or M-x describe-function to get the documentation for any function.  You can even press TAB ENT to jump to the source code of that function, to see how it's implemented.  This is great when you think \"I wish I had something that worked like foo, but just slightly different.\"  You can read how foo is implemented, make your change in the *scratch* buffer, and then see if you like the change.

When I started with C++, I didn't use them for a long time, until I came to the conclusion that I can do better using namespaces. \nMany libraries work around namespaces by putting prefixes before names. For example, wxWidgets puts the characters \"wx\" before everything. Qt puts \"Q\" before everything. It's nothing really wrong with that, but it requires you to type that prefix all over again, even though when it can be deduced from the context which declarations you mean. Namespaces have a hierarchic order. Names that are lexically closer to the point that reference them are found earlier. So if you reference \"Window\" within your GUI framework, it will find \"my::gui::Window\", instead of \"::Window\". \nNamespaces enable some nice features that can't be used without them. For example, if you put your class into a namespace, you can define free functions within that namespace. You then call the function without putting the namespace in front by importing all names, or selectively only some of them into the current scope (\"using declaration\"). \nNowadays, I don't do any project anymore without using them. They make it so easy not to type the same prefix all over again, but still have good organization and avoidance of name-pollution of the global namespace. \n", "visual studio 2008 - Viewing version tree in VS2008": "\nI suppose it depends where you did find your ClearCase plugin.\nI just check with one of my ClearCase VS2008 user:\nHe has 2 tool bars (one CC UCM, one Base CC with the version tree button)\nFor VS2008, you need first to install the CC plugin like VS2005, then adds some files and .reg to update this installation to a VS2008 compliant CC plugin.\n\nHere is our current ClearCase-VS2008 integration process:\nFollow this IBM technote if ClearCase is installed before VS .NET 2005/2003, in order to add \"IBM Rational ClearCase Client for VS .NET\" in the Custom Setup window step.\nGet the CC-CQ-VS2008.zip mentionned this IBM technote and execute \"reg_VS2008.bat\"\n\nThen tell me if you still do not see any \"version tree\" button.\n", "asp.net 2.0 - Installing .NET 3.5 on a server with .NET 2.0 applications": "\nIf you have .NET 2 SP1 you shouldn't have a problem.\nTo be exact .NET 3 & 3.5 are built on top of .NET 2.0 SP 1, we had a problem deploying 3.5 onto a server which only had .NET 2 (not SP1) and it caused the apps on there to break.

They can be adequate and most of the time adequate is OK but in a high-volume low-latency environment they're a no-no;\nIn general purpose programming languages like Java and C# you need an awful lot of magic to make them work (eg load-time weaving in Java, instrumentation, etc);\nWhen using an ORM, rather than getting further from SQL (which seems to be the intent), you'll be amazed how much time you spend tweaking XML and/or annotations/attributes to get your ORM to generate performant SQL;\nFor complex queries, there really is no substitute.  Like in JPA there are some queries that simply aren't possible that are in raw SQL and when you have to use raw SQL in JPA it's not pretty (C#/.Net at least has dynamic types--var--which is a lot nicer than an Object array);\nThere are an awful lot of \"gotchas\" when using ORMs.  This includes unintended or unexpected behavior, the fact that you have to build in the capability to do SQL updates to your database (by using refresh() in JPA or similar methods because JPA by default caches everything so it won't catch a direct database update--running direct SQL updates is a common production support activity);\nThe object-relational mismatch is always going to cause problems.  With any such problem there is a tradeoff between complexity and completeness of the abstraction.  At times I felt JPA went too far and hit a real law of diminishing returns where the complexity hit wasn't justified by the abstraction.\n\nThere's another problem which takes a bit more explanation.\nThe traditional model for a Web application is to have a persistence layer and a presentation layer (possibly with a services or other layers in between but these are the important two for this discussion).  ORMs force a rigid view from your persistence layer up to the presentation layer (ie your entities).\nOne of the criticisms of more raw SQL methods is that you end up with all these VOs (value objects) or DTOs (data transfer objects) that are used by simply one query.  This is touted as an advantage of ORMs because you get rid of that.\nThing is those problems don't go away with ORMs, they simply move up to the presentation layer.  Instead of creating VOs/DTOs for queries, you create custom presentation objects, typically one for every view.  How is this better?  IMHO it isn't.\nI've written about this in ORM or SQL: Are we there yet?.\nMy persistence technology of choice (in Java) these days is ibatis.  It's a pretty thin wrapper around SQL that does 90%+ of what JPA can do (it can even do lazy-loading of relationships although its not well-documented) but with far less overhead (in terms of complexity and actual code).\nThis came up last year in a GWT application I was writing.  Lots of translation from EclipseLink to presentation objects in the service implementation.  If we were using ibatis it would've been far simpler to create the appropriate objects with ibatis and then pass them all the way up and down the stack.  Some purists might argue this is Bad\u2122.  Maybe so (in theory) but I tell you what: it would've led to simpler code, a simpler stack and more productivity.\n", "cocoa touch - UILabel text overlapping on update?": "\ncheck the \"clears graphics context\" works for me, i carelessly deselected it at first~~\n", "user interface - Why is GUI code so computationally expensive?": "\nI've no idea generally, but I'd like to add another item to your list - font rendering and calculations. Finding vector glyphs in a font and converting them to bitmap representations with anti-aliasing is no small task. And often it needs to be done twice - first to calculate the width/height of the text for positioning, and then actually drawing the text at the right coordinates.\nAlso, most drawing code today relies on clipping mechanisms to update just a part of the GUI. So, if just one part needs to be redrawn, the code actually redraws the whole window behind the scenes, and then takes just the needed part to actually update.\nAdded:\nIn the comments I found this:\n\nI'm also very interested in this. It can't be that the gui is rendered using only the cpu because if you don't have proper drivers for your gfx-card, desktop graphics render incredibly slow. If you have gfx-drivers however desktop-gfx go kinda fast but never as fast as a directx/opengl app.\n\nHere's the deal as I understand it: every graphic card out there today supports a generic interface for drawing. I'm not sure if it's called \"VESA\", \"SVGA\", or if those are just old names from the past. Anyway, this interface involves doing everything through interrupts. For every pixel there is an interrupt call. Or something like that. The proper VGA driver however is able to take advantage of DMA and other enhancements that make the whole process WAY less CPU-intensive.\nAdded 2: Ah, and for OpenGL/DirectX - that's another feature of today's graphics cards. They are optimized for 3D operations in exclusive mode. That's why the speed. The normal GUI just utilizes basic 2D drawing procedures. So it gets to send the contents of the whole screen every time it wants an update. 3D applications however send a bunch of textures and triangle definitions to the VRAM (video-RAM) and then just reuse them for drawing. They just say something like \"take the triangle set #38 with the texture set #25 and draw them\". All these things are cached in the VRAM so this is again way faster.\nI'm not sure, but I would suspect that the modern 3D-accelerated GUIs (Vista Aero, compiz on Linux, etc.) also might take advantage of this. They could send common bitmaps to the VGA up front and then just reuse them directly from the VRAM. Any application-drawn surfaces however would still need to be sent directly every time for updates.\nAdded 3: More ideas. :) The modern GUI's for Windows, Linux, etc. are widget-oriented (that's control-oriented for Windows speakers). The problem with this is that each widget has its own drawing code and associated drawing surface (more or less). When the window needs to get redrawn, it calls the drawing code for all its child-widgets, who in turn call the drawing code for their child-widgets, etc.. Every widget redraws its whole surface, even though some of it is obscured by other widgets. With above mentioned clipping techniques some of this drawn information is immediately discarded to reduce flickering and other artifacts. But still it's lots of manual drawing code that includes bitmap blitting, stretching, skewing, drawing lines, text, flood-filling, etc.. And all this gets translated to a series of putpixel calls that get filtered through clipping filters/masks and other stuff. Ah, yes, and alpha blending has also become popular today for nice effects which means even more work. So... yes, you could say this is because of lots of abstraction and indirection. But... could you really do it any better? I don't think so. Only 3D techniques might help, because they take advantage of GPU for alpha-calculations and clipping.\n", "C#.NET How to add a hyperlink in a reportviewer": "\nI think your question has been answered here.\nEDIT:\nAs an example, on a TextBox:\nRight Click > Properties > Navigation > Jump to URL\nThis should be set to:   =\"page.aspx?id=\" & Fields!RelativePath.Value\nIf it's not working, it may be because of relative path issues.\nI'd suggest using System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory to construct the absolute URL to wherever you're trying to get to.\n", "multithreading - What happens if you fire a background thread to execute right before ASP.NET completes its page processing?": "\nI have done some experimenting with the same type of code doing some time consuming logging in a separate thread.

As a side note there are only 10 users, though.\nI actually found svnserve very easy to install and maintain and doesn't penalise you in lack of futures.

Hence, fooMethod(Class) is a subsignature of the fooMethod(Class<?>) but not the opposite (JLS 8.4.2).\nFor overriding with instance methods you need the overriding method to be a subsignature of the overridden method (JLS 8.4.8.1). This is clearly not the case here. \nNow that we have established the fact that your subclass method doesn't override the superclass method according to the JLS, let's look at the runtime implications when type erasure has occured. We now have two methods that look exactly the 'same' (same name, same parameter types) but do not override each other. If they don't override, they must be both available on the subtype as separate methods, but they have identical runtime signatures: conflict. So Java has to disallow it.\nOverriding generic parameter types using raw parameter types is allowed because raw types exist just for this reason: they are a convenient mechanism with specific unsound type rules to accommodate interaction with legacy code. So the type system here will decide that the subclass method does override the superclass one, they are identical after type erasure and we can never have a conflict. As a consequence of this libraries can be generified independently of existing non-generic code.\n", "How can I access the ListViewItems of a WPF ListView?": "\nTo understand why ContainerFromItem didn't work for me, here some background.

Instead it starts an asynchronous call and waits for the UI thread to callback and execute the actual ListViewItem control generation.\nTo be notified when this happens, the ItemContainerGenerator exposes a StatusChanged event which is fired after all Containers are generated.\nNow I have to listen to this event and decide whether the control currently want's to set focus or not.\n", "How to do Trim operation to remove space character in a text field in JavaScript?": "\nin case you did mean Trim:\nx.replace(/^\\s*|\\s*$/g,'');\n", "performance - Memory Allocation/Deallocation Bottleneck?": "\nIt's significant, especially as fragmentation grows and the allocator has to hunt harder across larger heaps for the contiguous regions you request.

We use the Fibonnaci scale and Planning Poker for this phase. It is important that the whole team actively participate in this process. \nAfter that, the team has to guess how many stories they are able to complete in the 1st sprint, which will be their initial estimated velocity (points/iteration).

The 1st planning will usually take the whole day or even 2 days, depending on backlog size, team size and the length of the sprints.\nAfter this 1st round of story estimation, the product owner together with the team might want re-prioritize the backlog to optimize the cost/benefit ratio, so the might be some back and forth until there is an agreement.\nYou should end up with something like this:\nPROJECT ACME ROADMAP\n\nSPRINT 1 (38 points) <= estimated velocity\n--------\nStory 1 (21 points)\nStory 2 (13 points)\nStory 3 (4 points)\n\nSPRINT 2 (40 points)\n--------\nStory 4 (13 points)\nStory 5 (13 points)\nStory 6 (8 points)\nStory 7 (5 points)\n\nSPRINT 3 (39 points)\n--------\n...\n\nOn the following sprints, this roadmap will be revised over and over, at the start of each sprint, adjusting the velocity to the actual velocity that the team is obtaining and re-calculating the project length as needed. Sometimes, re-estimating the stories is necessary as well, as the team evolves and requirements change. However, the time to revise the roadmap should be no more than half a day.\nThe progress at this level should be visible to stakeholders using a burndown chart, where the X axis are the sprints and the Y axis are the story points.\nSprint Estimation (Task Level)\nThe 2nd part of the planning phase for each sprint is spent breaking down each story into tasks. Here, tasks should be highly technical in nature and estimated using hours. We have a policy that if the task is estimated longer than 8 hours, then it needs to be broken down into more detailed tasks no matter what. The result will be the sprint backlog, with tasks grouped by story, and the sprint burndown chart, where X/Y axis should be days of the sprint and hours respectively.\nIt should look like this:\nSprint 8\n--------\nStory 17\n  Task 1: 8 hours\n  Task 2: 6 hours\n  Task 3: 2 hours\n\nStory 18\n  Task 1: 8 hours\n  Task 2: 6 hours\n\nStory 19\n  Task 1: 6 hours\n  Task 2: 3 hours\n...\n\nSo basically, these are the 2 types of estimation you should be doing at the start of each sprint, where usually the 1st sprint requires a little more effort to build the initial project roadmap.\n", "c# - Get raw text from markdown'ed text": "\n\nIn my DB, I have a text that is markdown'ed.

Some of the projects that are closer to the \"leaf\" of the dependency tree need to be able to use \"stable\" (or previously \"released\") versions of the more \"core\" projects.\nI solve exactly this problem using Hudson, ant, and ivy.  I follow a pattern demonstrated by Clark in Pragmatic Project Automation (he doesn't demonstrate the dependency problems and solutions, and he uses CruiseControl rather than hudson.)\nI have a hand-written ant build file (we call it \"cc-build.xml\", because of our CruiseControl roots.)  This file is responsible for refreshing the working space for the project from the CM repository and labeling the contents for future reference.  It then hands off control to another hand-written ant build file (build.xml) that is provided by each project's developers.  This project is responsible for the traditional build steps (compile, packaging, etc.)  It is required to spit out the installable artifacts, unit test reports, etc, to the Hudson artifacts directory. It is my experience that automatically generated build files (by Eclipse or other similar IDE's) will never get close to getting this sufficiently robust for use in a CI scenario. \nAdditionally, it uses ivy to resolve its own dependencies.   Ivy supports precisely-specified dependency versions (e.g. \"use version 1.1\") and it supports \"fuzzy versions\" (e.g. \"use version 1.1+\" or \"use the latest version in integration status.\")  Our projects typically start out specifying a very \"fuzzy\" version for internal projects under ongoing development, and as they get close to a release point, they \"freeze\" the dependency version so that stuff stops moving underneath them.\nThe non-leaf projects (projects that are dependents for other projects) also use ivy to publish their artifacts to our internal ivy repository.  That repository keeps all past builds of the dependents, so that any project can always depend on any other previous version.\nLastly, each project in Hudson is configured to have a build trigger that causes a rebuild when any of its dependent projects successfully build.  This causes them to get built again with the (possibly) new ivy dependent version.\nIt is worth noting that once you get this up and running, consistent automated \"labeling\" or \"tagging\" of an automated build's inputs is going to be critical for you - otherwise troubleshooting post-build problems is going to result in having to untangle a hornet's nest to find the original source.\nGetting all of this setup for our environment took quite a bit of effort (primarily in setting up the ivy repository and ant build files,) but it has paid for itself many times over in saved headaches in manually managing the dependencies and decreased troubleshooting effort.\n", "jdbc - Jython zxJDBC cursor.tables() always returns None": "\nTry a print cursor.fetchall() after your cursor.tables()\nfrom com.ziclix.python.sql import zxJDBC\nimport TableTest\n\nurl = 'jdbc:mysql://localhost/jythontest'\n\nprint 'Java:'\nTableTest.tables(url);\n\nprint 'Python:'\nconn = zxJDBC.connect(url, 'root', None, 'com.mysql.jdbc.Driver')\ncursor = conn.cursor()\nprint cursor.tables(None, None, '%', ('TABLE',))\nprint cursor.fetchall()\n\n(tested with Informix and jython 2.5 beta) \ni assume:\n\ncursor.tables() excutes the query in\npython \ncursor.fetchall() returns the\nresults\n\n", "c++ - vc++ Line Graph Example": "\nIn MFC:\nSee LineTo and also MoveTo from CDC.\nAnd use CPaintDC to draw on the OnPaint event like here.\n", ".net - WCF - advantages and disadvantages": "\nPrimary advantage: Once you get over the learning curve, WCF makes it relatively easy to expose and consume software components.  i.e. Given a component bakes functionality into a WCF Service Contract, a developer can expose that same component in-proc, across processes on a single box, across a Windows intranet, or throughout the internet all by just changing hosts and configuration information.

At the very least, you need one certificate with two different key usages or extended key usages.\nA few thoughts in no specific order:\n\nCheck your targeted browsers, they should each have a set of preconfigured root certificates - those are the most widely recognized public certificate sources.  I'd probably check both Firefox and IE. Certificate vendors known to me as big names are - Versign, GeoTrust, RSA, Thawte, Entrust.  But there's also GoDaddy and many others.  Anything that comes in the delivered browser as a Trusted Root Certificate, will allow you to connect to your users without additional greif.\nI suggest Googling for both \"code signing certificate\" and \"SSL certificate\". \nHow you configure your site will determine whether or not your website is validated or your authentication server is validated.  If the certificate is stored on the apps server, then your user is getting SSL encryption all the way to the server.  But many sites put the SSL certificate a little farther forward - like on a firewall, and then stage a collection of apps servers behind it.  I don't see a security flaw in that, so long as the networking is carefully configured.  To the outside users, both configurations will look the same - they'll get the lock on their browsers and a certificate that tells them that www.foo.com is offering it's credentials.\n\nI'm seeing pretty great deals for SSL Certificates:\n - GoDaddy - $12.99\n - Register.com - $14.99\nBut they aren't necessarily code signing certifiates. For example, while GoDaddy's SSL Cert is $12.99, their code signing certs are $199.99!  That's part of many certificate vendors business models - lure you in with cheap SSL Certs, and make you pay for code signing.  A case could be made that code signing certificates are relatively higher liability.  But also... they have to subsidize the cheap SSL certs somehow.\nTheoretically, it should be possible to make a certificate that does both code signing and SSL, but I'm not sure you want that.  If something should happen, it would be nice to be able to isolate the two functions.  Also, I'm pretty sure you'd have to call the certificate vendors and ask if they did this, and if they don't, having them do it will likely jack up the price quite high.\nAs far as vendor, things to consider:\n\nThe technology is pretty much all the same.  These days, aim for a minimum of 128 bit keys, I'd probably bump it up to 256, but I'm paranoid.\nBeyond browser acceptabiliy, the only reason to pay more would be name recognition.  Among the paranoid security wonks, I'd expect RSA, Thawte, Verisign and GeoTrust to have very good reputations.  Probably EnTrust, too.  This probably only matters if you are dealing with a security focused product.  I think your average user will not be so aware.\nFrom a security geek perspective - you're only as safe as the security of your Root CA (Certificate Authority).  For the truly paranoid, the thing to do would be to dig into the background material of how the company hosts its root and issuing CAs, how are they physically securited?  network security?  personnel access control?  Also - do they have public CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists), how do you get a cert revoked?  Do they offer OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)?  How do they check out certificate requestors to be sure they are giving the right cert to the right person?  ... All this stuff really matters if you are offering something that must be highly secure.  Things like medical records, financial managment applications, tax information, etc should be highly protected.  Most web apps aren't so high risk and probably don't require this degree of scrutiny.\n\nOn that last bullet - if you dig into the Verisigns of the world - the very expensive certs - you're likely to see the value.  They have a massive infrastructure and take the security of their CAs very seriously.  I'm not so sure about the super-cheap hosting services.  That said, if your risk is low, US$300 for an SSL Cert doesn't make much sense compared to US$12.99!!\n", "database - Datastructures used in DBMS": "\nUsually a clever implementation of B-Trees\nFrom the above linked wikipedia article:\n\nA B-tree of order m (the maximum number of children for each node) is a tree which satisfies the following properties:\n\nEvery node has at most m children.\nEvery node (except root and leaves) has at least m\u20442 children.\nThe root has at least two children if it is not a leaf node.\nAll leaves appear in the same level, and carry information.\nA non-leaf node with k children contains k\u20131 keys\n\n\nThe advantages of which are that data can be accessed in logarithmic time, as with most search trees (such as standard binary trees), but the timing properties are better in the average case.\n", "linux - Ffmpeg and Xing header - iTunes issue and Duration issue": "\nI have solved the above by making sure that I actually converted to an MP3 format rather than just copying the audio codec and assuming its already in MP3 format!!\n", "php - how to incorporate subdomains into MVC framework": "\nIt sounds like, to me, the approach you are describing is the logical next step to implement the features you are adding.

I'd start by just writing the HttpHandler and seeing how it performs. If you need it to be faster, try looking more closely at the things you're actually doing while processing the request and seeing what can be optimized. For example, if you're doing any logging to a database, try writing to a local database instead of across a network. If it's still not fast enough, then maybe look into writing something lower level. Until that point though, I'd stick with whatever's easiest for you to write.\nFor reference, I've written an ad server in ASP.NET (using HttpHandlers) that can serve an ad (including targeting and logging the impression to a local database) in 0-15ms under load. I thought I was doing quite a bit of processing - but that's a pretty good response time IMHO.\n\nUpdate after several months:\nIf you clear all the HttpModules that are included by default, this will remove a fair amount of overhead. By default, the following HttpModules are included in every site via the machine-level web.config file:\n\nOutputCache\nSession (for session state)\nWindowsAuthentication\nFormsAuthentication\nPassportAuthentication\nRoleManager\nUrlAuthorization\nFileAuthorization\nAnonymousIdentification\nProfile\nErrorHandler\nServiceModel\n\nLike I said above, my ad server doesn't use any of these, so I've just done this in that app's web.config:\n<httpModules>\n   <clear />\n</httpModules>\n\nIf you need some of those, but not all, you can remove the ones you don't need:\n<httpModules>\n   <remove name=\"PassportAuthentication\" />\n   <remove name=\"Session\" />\n</httpModules>\n\nASP.NET MVC Note: ASP.NET MVC requires the session state module unless you do something specific to workaround it.

Let's start at the beginning: you mentioned a \"multidimensional function\", but then go on to discuss the usual one-variable Gaussian curve. This is not a multidimensional function: when you integrate it, you only integrate one variable (x). The distinction is important to make, because there is a monster called a \"multivariate Gaussian distribution\" which is a true multidimensional function and, if integrated, requires integrating over two or more variables (which uses the expensive Monte Carlo technique I mentioned before). But you seem to just be talking about the regular one-variable Gaussian, which is much easier to work with, integrate, and all that.\nThe one-variable Gaussian distribution has two parameters, sigma and mu, and is a function of a single variable we'll denote x. You also appear to be carrying around a normalization parameter n (which is useful in a couple of applications). Normalization parameters are usually not included in calculations, since you can just tack them back on at the end (remember, integration is a linear operator: int(n*f(x), x) = n*int(f(x), x) ). But we can carry it around if you like; the notation I like for a normal distribution is then \nN(x | mu, sigma, n) := (n/(sigma*sqrt(2*pi))) * exp((-(x-mu)^2)/(2*sigma^2))\n(read that as \"the normal distribution of x given sigma, mu, and n is given by...\") So far, so good; this matches the function you've got. Notice that the only true variable here is x: the other three parameters are fixed for any particular Gaussian.\nNow for a mathematical fact: it is provably true that all Gaussian curves have the same shape, they're just shifted around a little bit. So we can work with N(x|0,1,1), called the \"standard normal distribution\", and just translate our results back to the general Gaussian curve. So if you have the integral of N(x|0,1,1), you can trivially calculate the integral of any Gaussian. This integral appears so frequently that it has a special name: the error function erf. Because of some old conventions, it's not exactly erf; there are a couple additive and multiplicative factors also being carried around. \nIf Phi(z) = integral(N(x|0,1,1), -inf, z); that is, Phi(z) is the integral of the standard normal distribution from minus infinity up to z, then it's true by the definition of the error function that\nPhi(z) = 0.5 + 0.5 * erf(z / sqrt(2)).\nLikewise, if Phi(z | mu, sigma, n) = integral( N(x|sigma, mu, n), -inf, z); that is, Phi(z | mu, sigma, n) is the integral of the normal distribution given parameters mu, sigma, and n from minus infinity up to z, then it's true by the definition of the error function that\nPhi(z | mu, sigma, n) = (n/2) * (1 + erf((x - mu) / (sigma * sqrt(2)))).\nTake a look at the Wikipedia article on the normal CDF if you want more detail or a proof of this fact.\nOkay, that should be enough background explanation. Back to your (edited) post. You say \"The erf(z) in scipy.special would require me to define exactly what t is initially\". I have no idea what you mean by this; where does t (time?) enter into this at all? Hopefully the explanation above has demystified the error function a bit and it's clearer now as to why the error function is the right function for the job.\nYour Python code is OK, but I would prefer a closure over a lambda:\ndef make_gauss(N, sigma, mu):\n    k = N / (sigma * math.sqrt(2*math.pi))\n    s = -1.0 / (2 * sigma * sigma)\n    def f(x):\n        return k * math.exp(s * (x - mu)*(x - mu))\n    return f\n\nUsing a closure enables precomputation of constants k and s, so the returned function will need to do less work each time it's called (which can be important if you're integrating it, which means it'll be called many times). Also, I have avoided any use of the exponentiation operator **, which is slower than just writing the squaring out, and hoisted the divide out of the inner loop and replaced it with a multiply. I haven't looked at all at their implementation in Python, but from my last time tuning an inner loop for pure speed using raw x87 assembly, I seem to remember that adds, subtracts, or multiplies take about 4 CPU cycles each, divides about 36, and exponentiation about 200. That was a couple years ago, so take those numbers with a grain of salt; still, it illustrates their relative complexity. As well, calculating exp(x) the brute-force way is a very bad idea; there are tricks you can take when writing a good implementation of exp(x) that make it significantly faster and more accurate than a general a**b style exponentiation.\nI've never used the numpy version of the constants pi and e; I've always stuck with the plain old math module's versions. I don't know why you might prefer either one.\nI'm not sure what you're going for with the quad() call. quad(gen_gauss, -inf, inf, (10,2,0)) ought to integrate a renormalized Gaussian from minus infinity to plus infinity, and should always spit out 10 (your normalization factor), since the Gaussian integrates to 1 over the real line. Any answer far from 10 (I wouldn't expect exactly 10 since quad() is only an approximation, after all) means something is screwed up somewhere... hard to say what's screwed up without knowing the actual return value and possibly the inner workings of quad().\nHopefully that has demystified some of the confusion, and explained why the error function  is the right answer to your problem, as well as how to do it all yourself if you're curious. If any of my explanation wasn't clear, I suggest taking a quick look at Wikipedia first; if you still have questions, don't hesitate to ask. \n", "visual studio - Loading excel column data using C# in a dropdown menu": "\nYou can use the OleDb Managed Data Provider to read an Excel spreadsheet using ADO.NET just like you would with a database.\nusing System.Data.OleDb;\n\nDataTable dt = new DataTable();\nstring connString = @\"Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=c:\\Book1.xls;Extended Properties='Excel 8.0;HDR=NO'\";\nusing (OleDbConnection conn = new OleDbConnection(connString))\n{\n    conn.Open();                \n    //Where [F1] = column one, [F2] = column two etc, etc.\n    OleDbCommand selectCommand = new OleDbCommand(\"select [F1] AS [id] from [Sheet1$]\",conn);\n    OleDbDataAdapter adapter = new OleDbDataAdapter();\n    adapter.SelectCommand = selectCommand;\n    adapter.Fill(dt);\n}\n\nlistBox1.DataSource = dt;\nlistBox1.DisplayMember = \"id\";\n\n", "c# - Unmanaged thread running Managed Code": "\nIn general, it's unsafe to kill a thread in a running process; see the warnings and notes in TerminateThread.\nIf I were doing such an app, I would be inclined to investigate ways to host the 3rd party module within a separate process with a well-defined communication interface; eg: inside a COM+ application.

If you're on IE6, prepare to see your computer spontaneously combust into a flaming ball of browser incompetence.\nTo read up on this, check out this thread (from my very first Stackoverflow post no less)!\nHere's a link to the jQuery docs for the animate() feature: http://docs.jquery.com/Effects/animate\n", "C++ 'true' and 'false' keywords suddenly not true or false in Visual C++ 6.0": "\nA preprocessor macro could certainly do it, although that would be pretty surprising.

This sample application does not violate the MVC principles according to me. RadControls do not rely on ViewState or postbacks in MVC applications (you can check the generated output to see for yourself - no __doPostBack or __VIEWSTATE). Indeed you need to write some code to bind the grid or populate the menu - but still the code is in the View (ASPX) and is entirely related with the presentation (again this is just my opinion so I might be wrong).\nI should also mention that there are some limitations indeed - some of the built-in features (that rely on postback) do not work in MVC.

For example, if your application superclassed the button class, a call to Get\u00adClass\u00adName would return Awesome\u00adButton, but a call to Real\u00adGet\u00adWindow\u00adClass would return button.\n", "java.awt.HeadlessException - Applet not displayed - Part 2": "\nYou could catch that exception or you could avoid it by checking first:\nif (! java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()) {\n    // code that throws headless exception\n} else {\n  log.info(\"Skipping GUI portion\")\n}\n\nDon't set a DISPLAY on a server that no one is going to look at, or you might end up waiting forever for someone to click OK on a dialog that no one can see.\n", "ios - How can I develop for iPhone using a Windows development machine?": "\nIt's certainly possible to develop on a Windows machine, in fact, my first application was exclusively developed on the old Dell Precision I had at the time :)\nThere are three routes;\n\nInstall OSx86 (aka iATKOS / Kalyway) on a second partition/disk and dual boot.\nRun Mac OS X Server under VMWare (Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) onwards, read the update below).\nUse a framework and/or toolset, which allows developing on Windows, like Delphi XE4 with the mac-in-cloud service, which can build without MacOS device need. This is a commercial toolset, but the component and lib support is growing.\n\nOther honorable mentions are Flutter, Xamarin and similar; which may at end need actual MacOS device for final build (but you can test on Android till then, as they're cross-platform).\n\n\n\nThe first route requires modifying (or using a pre-modified) image of Leopard that can be installed on a regular PC. This is not as hard as you would think, although your success/effort ratio will depend upon how closely the hardware in your PC matches that in Mac hardware - e.g. if you're running a Core 2 Duo on an Intel Motherboard, with an NVidia graphics card you are laughing. If you're running an AMD machine or something without SSE3 it gets a little more involved.\nIf you purchase (or already own) a version of Leopard then this is a gray area since the Leopard EULA states you may only run it on an \"Apple Labeled\" machine. As many point out if you stick an Apple sticker on your PC you're probably covered.\nThe second option is more costly. The EULA for the workstation version of Leopard prevents it from being run under emulation and as a result, there's no support in VMWare for this. Leopard server, however, CAN be run under emulation and can be used for desktop purposes. Leopard server and VMWare are expensive, however.\nIf you're interested in option 1) I would suggest starting at Insanelymac and reading the OSx86 sections.\nI do think you should consider whether the time you will invest is going to be worth the money you will save though. It was for me because I enjoy tinkering with this type of stuff and I started during the early iPhone betas, months before their App Store became available.\nAlternatively, you could pick up a low-spec Mac Mini from eBay. You don't need much horsepower to run the SDK and you can always sell it on later if you decide to stop development or buy a better Mac.\nUpdate: You cannot create a Mac OS X Client virtual machine for OS X 10.6 and earlier. Apple does not allow these Client OSes to be virtualized. With Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) onwards, Apple has changed its licensing agreement in regards to virtualization.

You are right that maintaining data isolation is a huge concern (1a technically shares this issue at a higher level). The other issue is if your application is data intensive you have to worry about data scalability. For example if every customer is expected to have tens/hundreds millions rows of data. Then you will start to run into issues and query performance for individual customers due to total customer base volumes. Clients are more forgiving for slowdowns caused by their own data volume. Being told its slow because the other 99 clients data is large is generally a no-go.\nUnless you know for a fact you will be dealing with huge data volumes from the start I would probably go with #2 for now, and begin looking at clustering or moving to 1a/b setup if needed in the future.\n", "Should I manually set Perl's @ARGV so I can use <> to open, scan, and close files?": "\nOn the topic of manipulating @ARGV - that's definitely working code, Perl certainly allows you to do that. I don't think it's a good coding habit though. Most of the code I've seen that uses the \"while (<>)\" idiom is using it to read from standard input, and that's what I initially expect your code to do. A more readable pattern might be to open/close each input file individually:\nforeach my $file (@files) {\n    open FILE, \"<$file\" or die \"Error opening file $file ($!)\";\n    my @lines = <FILE>;\n    close FILE or die $!;\n\n    foreach my $line (@file) {\n        if ( $line =~ /$pattern/ ) {\n            # do something here!\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThat would read more easily to me, although it is a few more lines of code. Perl allows you a lot of flexibility, but I think that makes it that much more important to develop your own style in Perl that's readable and understandable to you (and your co-workers, if that's important for your code/career).\nPutting subroutines in the main function or in a subroutine is also mostly a stylistic decision that you should play around with and think about. Modern computers are so fast at this stuff that style and readability is much more important for scripts like this, as you're not likely to encounter situations in which such a script over-taxes your hardware.\nGood luck!

However, unlike Network Service it accesses the network as an Anonymous user.\n\nName: NT AUTHORITY\\LocalService\nthe account has no password (any password information you provide is ignored)\nHKCU represents the LocalService user account\nhas minimal privileges on the local computer\npresents anonymous credentials on the network\nSID: S-1-5-19\nhas its own profile under the HKEY_USERS registry key (HKEY_USERS\\S-1-5-19)\n\n\u00a0\nNetworkService account \nLimited service account that is meant to run standard privileged services. This account is far more limited than Local System (or even Administrator) but still has the right to access the network as the machine (see caveat above).\n\nNT AUTHORITY\\NetworkService\nthe account has no password (any password information you provide is ignored)\nHKCU represents the NetworkService user account\nhas minimal privileges on the local computer\npresents the computer's credentials (e.g. MANGO$) to remote servers\nSID: S-1-5-20\nhas its own profile under the HKEY_USERS registry key (HKEY_USERS\\S-1-5-20)\nIf trying to schedule a task using it, enter NETWORK SERVICE into the Select User or Group dialog  \n\n\u00a0\nLocalSystem account (dangerous, don't use!) \nCompletely trusted account, more so than the administrator account.

For example, processing running as LocalService can still access the internet. \nThe general issue with running as a standard out of the box account is that if you modify any of the default permissions you're expanding the set of things everything running as that account can do. So if you grant DBO to a database, not only can your service running as Local Service or Network Service access that database but everything else running as those accounts can too. If every developer does this the computer will have a service account that has permissions to do practically anything (more specifically the superset of all of the different additional privileges granted to that account).\nIt is always preferable from a security perspective to run as your own service account that has precisely the permissions you need to do what your service does and nothing else. However, the cost of this approach is setting up your service account, and managing the password. It's a balancing act that each application needs to manage.\nIn your specific case, the issue that you are probably seeing is that the the DCOM or COM+ activation is limited to a given set of accounts. In Windows XP SP2, Windows Server 2003, and above the Activation permission was restricted significantly. You should use the Component Services MMC snapin to examine your specific COM object and see the activation permissions. If you're not accessing anything on the network as the machine account you should seriously consider using Local Service (not Local System which is basically the operating system). \n\nIn Windows Server 2003 you cannot run a scheduled task as \n\nNT_AUTHORITY\\LocalService (aka the Local Service account), or \nNT AUTHORITY\\NetworkService (aka the Network Service account). \n\nThat capability only was added with Task Scheduler 2.0, which only exists in Windows Vista/Windows Server 2008 and newer.\nA service running as NetworkService presents the machine credentials on the network.

This is the reason all the network operations in SL are forced async.\nYou can't touch the UI from any thread but the UI thread.\n\nThose are the two constraints.

The Android SDK doesn't provide a direct method to change the indicator of a TabHost after it's been created.  The TabSpec is only used to build the tab, so changing the TabSpec after the fact will have no effect.\nI think there's a workaround, though.  Call mTabs.getTabWidget() to get a TabWidget object.  This is just a subclass of ViewGroup, so you can call getChildCount() and getChildAt() to access individual tabs within the TabWidget.  Each of these tabs is also a View, and in the case of a tab with a graphical indicator and a text label, it's almost certainly some other ViewGroup (maybe a LinearLayout, but it doesn't matter) that contains an ImageView and a TextView.  So with a little fiddling with the debugger or Log.i, you should be able to figure out a recipe to get the ImageView and change it directly.\nThe downside is that if you're not careful, the exact layout of the controls within a tab could change and your app could break.  Your initial solution is perhaps more robust, but then again it might lead to other unwanted side effects like flicker or focus problems.\n", "c++ - How to implement RFC 3393 (Ipdv packet delay varation) in C?": "\nRFC 3393 is for measuring the variance in the packet delay, not for measuring the delay itself.  \nTo give an example: you're writing a video streaming application.  You want to buffer as little video data as possible (so that the video starts playing as soon as possible).  Let's say that data always always always takes 20ms to get from machine A to machine B.  In this case (and assuming that machine A can send the video data as fast as it needs playing), you don't need any buffer at all.  As soon as you receive the first frame, you can start playing, safe in the knowledge that by the time the next frame is needed, it will have arrived (because the data always takes exactly 20ms to arrive and machine A is sending at least as fast as you're playing).  \nThis works no matter how long that 20ms is, as long as it's always the same.  It could be 1000ms - the first frame takes 1000ms to arrive, but you can still start playing as soon as it arrives, because the next frame will also take 1000ms and was sent right behind the first frame - in other words, it's already on its way and will be here momentarily.  Obviously the real world isn't like this.\nTake the other extreme: most of the time, data arrives in 20ms.  Except sometimes, when it takes 5000ms.  If you keep no buffer and the delay on frames 1 through 50 is 20ms, then you get to play the first 50 frames without a problem.  Then frame 51 takes 5000ms to arrive and you're left without any video data for 5000ms.  The user goes and visits another site for their cute cat videos.  What you really needed was a buffer of 5000ms of data - then you'd have been fine.\nLong example, short point: you're not interested in what the absolute delay on the packets is, you're interested in what the variance in that delay is - that's how big your buffer has to be.\nTo measure the absolute delay, you'd have to have the clocks on both machines be synchronised.  Machine A would send a packet with timestamp 12337849227 28 and when that arrived at machine B at time 12337849227 48, you'd know the packet had taken 20ms to get there.\nBut since you're interested in the variance, you need (as RFC 3393 describes) several packets from machine A.  Machine A sends packet 1 with timestamp 1233784922 72 8, then 10ms later sends packet 2 with timestamp 1233784922 73 8, then 10ms later sends packet 3 with timestamp 1233784922 74 8.\nMachine B receives packet 1 at what it thinks is timestamp 1233784922 12 8.  The one-way delay between machine A and machine B has in this case (from machine B's perspective) been -600ms.  This is obviously complete rubbish, but we don't care.  Machine B receives packet 2 at what it thinks is timestamp 1233784922 15 8.  The one-way delay has been -580ms.  Machine B receives packet 3 at what it thinks is timestamp 1233784922 16 8.  The one-way delay was again -580ms.\nAs above, we don't care what the absolute delay is - so we don't even care if it's negative, or three hours, or whatever.  What we care about is that the amount of delay varied by 20ms.  So you need a buffer of 20ms of data.\nNote that I'm entirely glossing over the issue of clock drift here (that is, the clocks on machines A and B running at slightly different rates, so that for example machine A's time advances at a rate of 1.00001 seconds for every second that actually passed).

However, note that taking measurements of the element will force it to reflow, so that the measurements will be correct. The changes may or may not not be visibly repainted, but the reflow itself still has to happen behind the scenes.\nThis effect is created when measurements are taken using properties like offsetWidth, or using methods like getComputedStyle. Even if the numbers are not used, simply using either of these while the browser is still caching changes, will be enough to trigger the hidden reflow. If these measurements are taken repeatedly, you should consider taking them just once, and storing the result, which can then be used later.\n\nI take this to mean the same thing they said earlier. Opera will try its hardest to cache values and avoid reflow for you, but you shouldn't rely on its ability to do so.\nFor all intents and purposes just believe what they both say when they say that all three types of interactions can cause reflow.\nCheers.\n", "sql server - Why does a parameterized query produces vastly slower query plan vs non-parameterized query": "\nIt appears that the query planner has made a decision in the literal query which is based upon information that it already has.

There are no known encryption schemes (let alone public-key ones) that are based on an NP-complete problem (and hence all of them, under polynomial-time reductions).  Some are \"closer\" that others, though, so let me elaborate.\nThere is a lot to clarify here, so let's start with the meaning of \"based on an NP-complete problem.\"  The generally agreed upon interpretation of this is: \"can be proven secure in a particular formal model, assuming that no polynomial-time algorithms exist for NP-complete problems\".  To be even more precise, we assume that no algorithm exists that always solves an NP-complete problem.  This is a very safe assumption, because that's a really hard thing for an algorithm to do - it's seemingly a lot easier to come up with an algorithm that solves random instances of the problem with good probability.\nNo encryption schemes have such a proof, though.  If you look at the literature, with very few exceptions (see below), the security theorems read like the following:\n\nTheorem: This encryption scheme is provably secure, assuming that no\n  polynomial-time algorithm exists for\n  solving random instances of some problem X.\n\nNote the \"random instances\" part.  For a concrete example, we might assume that no polynomial-time algorithm exists for factoring the product of two random n-bit primes with some good probability.  This is very different (less safe) from assuming that no polynomial-time algorithm exists for always factoring all products of two random n-bit primes.\nThe \"random instances\" versus \"worst case instances\" issue is what is tripped up several responders above.  The McEliece-type encryption schemes are based on a very special random version of decoding linear codes - and not on the actual worst-case version which is NP-complete.\nPushing beyond this \"random instances\" issue has required some deep and beautiful research in theoretical computer science.  Starting with the work of Mikl\u00f3s Ajtai, we have found cryptographic algorithms where the security assumption is a \"worst case\" (safer) assumption instead of a random case one.  Unfortunately, the worst case assumptions are for problems that are not known to be NP complete, and some theoretical evidence suggests that we can't adapt them to use NP-complete problems.  For the interested, look up \"lattice based cryptography\".\n", "javascript - Setting cross-domain cookies in Safari": "\nFrom the Safari Developer FAQ:\n\nSafari ships with a conservative cookie policy which limits cookie writes to only the pages chosen (\"navigated to\") by the user.

The abstraction has worked pretty well over the past year and a half across these disparate methods, although sometimes the GUI will display different verbiage to the user (for example, it'll say \"Authorize\" and \"Charge\" instead of \"Approve\" and \"Deposit\" for credit card payments, and the screen for entering cash performs the Approve/Deposit step in one fell swoop.)\nHope that makes sense.

Thus, if you have two methods in a class where both methods have the same name, same return type, but different parameter types, then any code invoking this overloaded method must make explicit which one will be invoked.  Your current code does this with the types it provides due to the use of explicit casts but the fully dynamic version does not.  If method overloading were decided at runtime, then your code would do what you want.  But because it is decided at compile time, your code does not compile.\nTo solve your problem, you can use generics, or you can restructure your code.  First I'll introduce a test harness that shows a very simplified version of what you're starting with:\npublic class Test {\n  public void test(Object obj) {\n    if (obj instanceof Horse) {\n      Horse c = (Horse) obj;\n      noise(c);\n    }\n    if (obj instanceof Cow) {\n      Cow c = (Cow) obj;\n      noise(c);\n    }\n  }\n\n  public void noise(Horse h) {\n    System.out.println(\"Neigh\");\n  }\n\n  public void noise(Cow c) {\n    System.out.println(\"Moo\");\n  }\n\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    Object o1 = new Horse();\n    Object o2 = new Cow();\n    Test tester = new Test();\n    tester.test(o1);\n    tester.test(o2);\n  }\n}\n\nclass Horse {}\n\nclass Cow {}\n\nThis code runs and does what you would expect.  It prints \"Neigh\" followed by \"Moo\".\nYou are trying to replace\n    if (obj instanceof Horse) {\n      Horse c = (Horse) obj;\n      noise(c);\n    }\n\nwith \n    if (obj instanceof Horse) {\n      handleNoise(obj, Horse.class);\n    }\n\nand then adding the method to handle it (simplified):\nvoid handleNoise(Object obj, Class clazz) {\n  noise(clazz.cast(obj));\n}\n\nand as I said before, this doesn't work the overloading of noise is decided at compile time.  The compiler sees that you are casting, but does not know at compile time what the type is.  So it cannot pick an overloading and compilation fails.\nThe best way to solve this is by using polymorphism, because polymorphism is decided at runtime.  That is, have all of those classes implement some interface and then move the code in question into the individual classes.  Here is an example that does this:\npublic class Test {\n  public void test(Animal obj) {\n    obj.noise();\n  }\n\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    Animal o1 = new Horse();\n    Animal o2 = new Cow();\n    Test tester = new Test();\n    tester.test(o1);\n    tester.test(o2);\n  }\n}\n\ninterface Animal {\n  void noise();\n}\n\nclass Horse implements Animal {\n  public void noise() {\n    System.out.println(\"Neigh\");\n  }\n}\n\nclass Cow implements Animal {\n  public void noise() {\n    System.out.println(\"Moo\");\n  }\n}\n\nNotice how much simpler the test method is!  If you can have each item implement an interface that handles what you call stringProp below, then you can simplify part way:\nif (obj instanceof Cust) {\n  loopOverSet(c.getCustPhonSet());\n} else if (obj instanceof Name) {\n  loopOverSet(c.getCustNameSet());\n}\n// and so on for the rest...\n\nand then add the method:\nvoid loopOVerSet(Set cxSet) {\n  if (cxSet != null && cxSet.size() > 0) {\n    Iterator cxSetIterator = cxSet.iterator();\n    while (cxSetIterator.hasNext())\n    {\n      ((StringProp)cxSetIterator.next()).stringProp();\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThis assumes that the previously-overloaded methods stringProp have been moved into the individual classes CustPhone and CustName and so on and that these classes all implement some interface which I've called StringProp where this interface defines the method stringProp().  Since this code is using overriding instead of overloading it will be decided at runtime.\n", "How can i add a MouseDown event handler to a <asp: button> control?": "\nSpecifically to answer your question as stated in your title: to add additional event handlers to an asp:button or other server controls that are not composite you simply add the handler to the element.

I realize you may not be a native English speaker but perhaps you could give it another pass.\n", "Which is faster, python webpages or php webpages?": "\nIt sounds like you don't want to compare the two languages, but that you want to compare two web systems.\nThis is tricky, because there are many variables involved.\nFor example, Python web applications can take advantage of mod_wsgi to talk to web servers, which is faster than any of the typical ways that PHP talks to web servers (even mod_php ends up being slower if you're using Apache, because Apache can only use the Prefork MPM with mod_php rather than multi-threaded MPM like Worker).\nThere is also the issue of code compilation. As you know, Python is compiled just-in-time to byte code (.pyc files) when a file is run each time the file changes. Therefore, after the first run of a Python file, the compilation step is skipped and the Python interpreter simply fetches the precompiled .pyc file. Because of this, one could argue that Python has a native advantage over PHP. However, optimizers and caching systems can be installed for PHP websites (my favorite is eAccelerator) to much the same effect.\nIn general, enough tools exist such that one can pretty much do everything that the other can do. Of course, as others have mentioned, there's more than just speed involved in the business case to switch languages. We have an app written in oCaml at my current employer, which turned out to be a mistake because the original author left the company and nobody else wants to touch it. Similarly, the PHP-web community is much larger than the Python-web community; Website hosting services are more likely to offer PHP support than Python support; etc.\nBut back to speed. You must recognize that the question of speed here involves many moving parts. Fortunately, many of these parts can be independently optimized, affording you various avenues to seek performance gains.\n", "language agnostic - Algorithm for Finding Redundant Edges in a Graph or Tree": "\nYou want to compute the smallest graph which maintains vertex reachability.\nThis is called the transitive reduction of a graph.

The compiler at this stage needs your source and the header files of the other stuff that you're going to link with (see below).\nCompilation consists of turning your source files into object files. Object files have your compiled code and enough information to know what other stuff they need, but not where to find that other stuff (e.g., the LUA libraries).\n2/ Linking, the next stage, is combining all your object files with libraries to create an executable. I won't cover dynamic linking here since that will complicate the explanation with little benefit.\nNot only do you need to specify the directories where the linker can find the other code, you need to specify the actual library containing that code. The fact that you're getting  unresolved externals indicates that you haven't done this.\nAs an example, consider the following simplified C code (xx.c) and command.\n#include <bob.h>\nint x = bob_fn(7);\n\ncc -c -o xx.obj xx.c\n\nThis compiles the xx.c file to xx.obj. The bob.h contains the prototype for bob_fn() so that compilation will succeed. The -c instructs the compiler to generate an object file rather than an executable and the -o xx.obj sets the output file name.\nBut the actual code for bob_fn() is not in the header file but in /bob/libs/libbob.so, so to link, you need something like:\ncc -o xx.exe xx.obj -L/bob/libs;/usr/lib -lbob\n\nThis creates xx.exe from xx.obj, using libraries (searched for in the given paths) of the form libbob.so (the lib and .so are added by the linker usually). In this example, -L sets the search path for libraries. The -l specifies a library to find for inclusion in the executable if necessary. The linker usually takes the \"bob\" and finds the first relevant library file in the search path specified by -L.\nA library file is really a collection of object files (sort of how a zip file contains multiple other files, but not necessarily compressed) - when the first relevant occurrence of an undefined external is found, the object file is copied from the library and added to the executable just like your xx.obj file. This generally continues until there are no more unresolved externals. The 'relevant' library is a modification of the \"bob\" text, it may look for libbob.a, libbob.dll, libbob.so, bob.a, bob.dll, bob.so and so on. The relevance is decided by the linker itself and should be documented.\nHow it works depends on the linker but this is basically it.\n1/ All of your object files contain a list of unresolved externals that they need to have resolved. The linker puts together all these objects and fixes up the links between them (resolves as many externals as possible).\n2/ Then, for every external still unresolved, the linker combs the library files looking for an object file that can satisfy the link. If it finds it, it pulls it in - this may result in further unresolved externals as the object pulled in may have its own list of externals that need to be satisfied.\n3/ Repeat step 2 until there are no more unresolved externals or no possibility of resolving them from the library list (this is where your development was at, since you hadn't included the LUA library file).\nThe complication I mentioned earlier is dynamic linking. That's where you link with a stub of a routine (sort of a marker) rather than the actual routine, which is later resolved at load time (when you run the executable). Things such as the Windows common controls are in these DLLs so that they can change without having to relink the objects into a new executable.\n", "authentication - How should I implement user membership in my ASP.NET MVC site?": "\nWhen you create a new ASP.NET MVC site, it already has membership built in.

To specifically set a mime-type of a given file-type, you must use auto props. \nPlease note that if subversion determines your file to be of mime-type image/x-xbitmap or image/x-xpixmap, it will be treated as a text file\nAuto-props affect the svn add and svn import actions and are set using the runtime configuration, which are specified through either command line options or in the config file for subversion, found in the subversion installation conf directory.\nThe following values should be set:\n# default is 'no', so we enable auto props with\nenable-auto-props = yes\n\n# specify absolute path to mime.types like file, e.g.\nmime-types-file = /etc/mime.types\n\nThis should map your binary files correctly.\nEDIT: From the cvs2svn manual:\n\n--auto-props=FILE     \nSpecify a file in the format of Subversion's config file, whose\n  [auto-props] section can be used to set arbitrary properties on\n  files in the Subversion repository based on their filenames. (The\n  [auto-props] section header must be present; other sections of the\n  config file, including the enable-auto-props setting, are ignored.)\n  Filenames are matched to the filename patterns case-insensitively,\n  consistent with Subversion's behavior. The auto-props file might\n  have content like this:\n[auto-props]\n*.txt = svn:mime-type=text/plain;svn:eol-style=native\n*.doc = svn:mime-type=application/msword;!svn:eol-style\n\n\nSo, using the command line switch --auto-props and an auto-props\nfile, you should be able to get the wanted functionality of the\ncvs2svn script\n", "refactoring - When is a function too long?": "\nHere is a list of red-flags (in no particular order) that could indicate that a function is too long:\n\nDeeply nested control structures: e.g. for-loops 3 levels deep or even just 2 levels deep with nested if-statements that have complex conditions.\nToo many state-defining parameters: By state-defining parameter, I mean a function parameter that guarantees a particular execution path through the function.  Get too many of these type of parameters and you have a combinatorial explosion of execution paths (this usually happens in tandem with #1).\nLogic that is duplicated in other methods: poor code re-use is a huge contributor to monolithic procedural code.  A lot of such logic duplication can be very subtle, but once re-factored, the end result can be a far more elegant design.\nExcessive inter-class coupling: this lack of proper encapsulation results in functions being concerned with intimate characteristics of other classes, hence lengthening them.\nUnnecessary overhead: Comments that point out the obvious, deeply nested classes, superfluous getters and setters for private nested class variables, and unusually long function/variable names can all create syntactic noise within related functions that will ultimately increase their length.\nYour massive developer-grade display isn't big enough to display it: Actually, displays of today are big enough that a function that is anywhere close to its height is probably way too long.  But, if it is larger, this is a smoking gun that something is wrong.\nYou can't immediately determine the function's purpose:  Furthermore, once you actually do determine its purpose, if you can't summarize this purpose in a single sentence or happen to have a tremendous headache, this should be a clue.  \n\nIn conclusion, monolithic functions can have far-reaching consequences and are often a symptom of major design deficiencies.  Whenever I encounter code that is an absolute joy to read, it's elegance is immediately apparent.  And guess what: the functions are often very short in length.\n", "objective c - How do I generate random numbers on iOS?": "\nThere is a very similar question here on StackOverFlow.

Specifically:\n\nCreate a UIView subclass and name it something like RoundRectView.\nIn RoundRectView's drawRect: method, draw a path around the bounds of the view using Core Graphics calls like CGContextAddLineToPoint() for the edges and and CGContextAddArcToPoint() for the rounded corners.\nCreate a UILabel instance and make it a subview of the RoundRectView.\nSet the frame of the label to be a few pixels inset of the RoundRectView's bounds. (For example, label.frame = CGRectInset(roundRectView.bounds, 8, 8);)\n\nYou can place the RoundRectView on a view using Interface Builder if you create a generic UIView and then change its class using the inspector.

It happened with classic ASP, .NET just makes it a lot easier. Most of us in this profession have a natural tendency to overcomplicate things, and it takes discipline and an active mind to overcome that.\nAlso, many mediocre developers wrongly believe that maximizing layers of abstraction and pattern use makes them better developers.\nFinally, many mediocre developers have been taught that they should use layers, abstractions and patterns, but have not been taught well enough to know how, when or why. So they go into a project thinking \"well, I know I should have some layers here...\" and you can imagine what comes out.\nUltimately, the \"best practice\" of best practices is to code as simply as possible UNTIL you run into a real problem that is preventing you from moving forward.

You don't make the cpu more faster by having more threads but you make it more likely a thread will always appear at within a given period to handle a request. \nHaving a bunch of threads which just move data in parallel is a rather inefficient shot-gun (Creating one thread per request naturally just fails completely). Using the thread pool pattern can be a more effective, focused approach to decreasing latency. \nNow, in the thread pool, you want to have at least as many threads as you have CPUs/cores. You can have more than this but the extra threads will again only decrease latency and not increase speed. \nThink the problem of organizing server threads as akin to organizing a line in a super market. Would you like to have a lot of cashiers who work more slowly or one cashier who works super fast? The problem with the fast cashier isn't speed but rather that one customer with a lot of groceries might still take up a lot of their time. The need for many threads comes from the possibility that a few request that will take a lot of time and block all your threads. By this reasoning, whether you benefit from many slower cashiers depends on whether your have the same number of groceries or wildly different numbers.

That's not the same thing as your problem, which is keeping a connection alive during a request. To configure the per-connection timeout see KB181050.\nAssuming the programming angle here is that you are trying to write a server-side script that takes a long time to complete:\nTo avoid the request timing out, you need to have the server-side script return something every so often to reassure the browser that the server hasn't died and a result will be forthcoming.\nHow exactly you might do this depends on what server-side technologies you're using. Anything that waits for the entire response body and headers to be completed before sending anything back to the client is out. In eg. CGI you could return a response body with 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked' to spit out a few bytes every so often and keep the connection alive.\nAlternatively, return a page right away and spawn the long process in the background, then have the client side page poll for its completion.\n", "java - How to quickly find added / removed files?": "\nCan you jump out of java.\nYou could simply use\ndir /b /s /on M:\\tests\\  \n\nthe /on sorts by name\nif you pipe that out to out.txt\nThen do a diff to the last time you ran this file either in Java or in a batch file.

That was a long time ago! leventov's answer offers a more up-to-date perspective.\nThat post is wrong, and nanoTime is safe. There's a comment on the post which links to a blog post by David Holmes, a realtime and concurrency guy at Sun. It says:\n\nSystem.nanoTime() is implemented using the QueryPerformanceCounter/QueryPerformanceFrequency API [...] The default mechanism used by QPC is determined by the Hardware Abstraction layer(HAL) [...] This default changes not only across hardware but also across OS versions. For example Windows XP Service Pack 2 changed things to use the power management timer (PMTimer) rather than the processor timestamp-counter (TSC) due to problems with the TSC not being synchronized on different processors in SMP systems, and due the fact its frequency can vary (and hence its relationship to elapsed time) based on power-management settings.\n\nSo, on Windows, this was a problem up until WinXP SP2, but it isn't now.\nI can't find a part II (or more) that talks about other platforms, but that article does include a remark that Linux has encountered and solved the same problem in the same way, with a link to the FAQ for clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME), which says:\n\n\nIs clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME) consistent across all processors/cores? (Does arch matter?  e.g. ppc, arm, x86, amd64, sparc).\n\nIt should or it's considered buggy.\nHowever, on x86/x86_64, it is possible to see unsynced or variable freq TSCs cause time inconsistencies. 2.4 kernels really had no protection against this, and early 2.6 kernels didn't do too well here either. As of 2.6.18 and up the logic for detecting this is better and we'll usually fall back to a safe clocksource.\nppc always has a synced timebase, so that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nSo, if Holmes's link can be read as implying that nanoTime calls clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME), then it's safe-ish as of kernel 2.6.18 on x86, and always on PowerPC (because IBM and Motorola, unlike Intel, actually know how to design microprocessors).\nThere's no mention of SPARC or Solaris, sadly. And of course, we have no idea what IBM JVMs do. But Sun JVMs on modern Windows and Linux get this right.\nEDIT: This answer is based on the sources it cites. But i still worry that it might actually be completely wrong. Some more up-to-date information would be really valuable.

That will tell you how the webserver locally is serving up the file.\nUpdate: Having looked at your file, it really is iso-8859-1, so what I would suggest is setting the .Encoding attribute of your Webclient instance like so before you tell it to download the file:\nclient.Encoding = System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding(\"iso-8859-1\")\n\nAlternatively, you could use the DownloadBytes methods instead of the DownloadString methods, and then parse the bytes into an xml file.  The problem currently is that by the time the xml parser gets the file contents, the bytes have already been interpreted as a string, so it's too late to change the encoding there.\n", "apache flex - spline for non differentiable function?": "\nYou can't calculate the gradient of a \"kink\" (as you so eloquently put it). If you really need a gradient at such a point (x), I'd just average the gradient at (x-d) and (x+d) where d is a small enough delta. It's as mathematically valid as any other single answer you're likely to get.\nFor example, the function:\nf(x) = |x|\n\nwill produce:\n\\   |   /\n \\  |  /\n  \\ | /\n   \\|/\n----+----\n\nwhere there is no gradient at the origin (0,0). However, averaging the gradients at -0.0001 (gradient = -1) and +0.0001 (gradient = +1) will give you a gradient of zero (flat line).\nThis should give a half-decent answer for other equations that produce non-symmetrical gradients at (x-d) and (x+d) as well.\nWhat I would do, since it's licensed under MIT, is to modify the source to allow an option for the Bezierspline to use that +/- delta method to calculate gradients at the non-continuous points.

Unless you have to re-sort it many times per minute, I would suggest you just use the qsort() built into the language. That's what it's for, after all.\nI'd suggest using a simple array of char pointers for the alpha order. For maintaining the frequency order, you'll can use a structure such as:\ntypedef struct {\n    char *word;      // points to one of the strings.\n    int frequency;   // counts the number of occurrences.\n} tFreq;\n\nin another array, which you can populate fully whenever you create or modify the alpha-sorted array of pointers (see below for my reasoning why this seemingly inefficient process is suitable).\nAs an example of the speed, consider the following piece of code:\n#include <stdio.h>\n#define MAXWDS 66000\n\nstatic char *words[MAXWDS];\n\nstatic int compFn (const void *p1, const void *p2) {\n    return strcmp (*((const char **)p1), *((const char **)p2));\n}\n\nint main() {\n    char *pWord;\n    int i, j, sz;\n    time_t t0, t1;\n\n    srand (time (0));\n    for (i = 0; i < MAXWDS; i++) {\n        sz = rand() % 32 + 1;\n        pWord = words[i] = malloc (sz + 1);\n        for (j = 0; j < sz; j++)\n            pWord[j] = 'A' + (rand() % 26);\n        pWord[sz] = '\\0';\n    }\n\n    t0 = time(0);\n    qsort (words, MAXWDS, sizeof (char*), compFn);\n    t1 = time(0);\n\n    printf (\"Time taken for %7d elements was %2d second(s)\\n\", MAXWDS, t1 - t0);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nOn a 3GHz dual core Intel chip, here's the outputs from a few select values of MAXWDS:\n   MAXWDS   Output\n---------   ------\n   66,000   Time taken for   66000 elements was  0 second(s)\n  100,000   Time taken for  100000 elements was  0 second(s)\n  500,000   Time taken for  500000 elements was  0 second(s)\n  600,000   Time taken for  600000 elements was  1 second(s)\n1,000,000   Time taken for 1000000 elements was  1 second(s)\n2,000,000   Time taken for 2000000 elements was  2 second(s)\n3,000,000   Time taken for 3000000 elements was  5 second(s)\n4,000,000   Time taken for 4000000 elements was  7 second(s)\n5,000,000   Time taken for 5000000 elements was  9 second(s)\n6,000,000   Time taken for 6000000 elements was 10 second(s)\n7,000,000   Time taken for 7000000 elements was 11 second(s)\n9,999,999   Time taken for 9999999 elements was 21 second(s)\n\nSo, as you can see, qsort is fairly efficient for the data set sizes you're talking about.\nIn fact, implementing the whole process for maintaining two sorted lists, as shown in the code below, shows you exactly how insignificant 66,000 elements are. The basic premise is to:\n\nmodify the alpha sorted strings as needed, then do a full alpha sort of them (t0 to t1).\nuse the fact that they're sorted to easily transfer them to another array but with only one element per word, and the frequency (t1 to t2).\nsort that frequency array as well (t2 to t3).\n\nThe following code shows how that's done. The only mildly tricky bit is the transfer from the alpha array to the frequency array.\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#define MAXWDS 66000\ntypedef struct {\n    char *word;\n    int frequency;\n} tFreq;\nstatic char *words[MAXWDS];\nstatic tFreq freq[MAXWDS];\nstatic int numFreq;\n\nstatic int compFn (const void *p1, const void *p2) {\n    return strcmp (*((const char **)p1), *((const char **)p2));\n}\n\nstatic int compFn2 (const void *p1, const void *p2) {\n    return ((tFreq*)p2)->frequency - ((tFreq*)p1)->frequency;\n}\n\n\u00a0\nint main() {\n    char *pWord;\n    int i, j, sz;\n    time_t t0, t1, t2, t3;\n\n    // Generate random words.\n    srand (time (0));\n    for (i = 0; i < MAXWDS; i++) {\n        sz = rand() % 32 + 1;\n        pWord = words[i] = malloc (sz + 1);\n        for (j = 0; j < sz; j++)\n            pWord[j] = 'A' + (rand() % 26);\n        pWord[sz] = '\\0';\n    }\n\n    t0 = time(0);\n\n    // Alpha sort.\n    qsort (words, MAXWDS, sizeof (char*), compFn);\n    t1 = time(0);\n\n\u00a0\n    // Pre-condition to simplify loop: make first word with zero frequency.\n\n    freq[0].word = words[0];\n    freq[0].frequency = 0;\n\n    // Transfer to frequency array.\n\n    for (i = numFreq = 0; i < MAXWDS; i++) {\n        // If new word, add it and set frequency to 0.\n        if (strcmp (freq[numFreq].word, words[i]) != 0) {\n            numFreq++;\n            freq[numFreq].word = words[i];\n            freq[numFreq].frequency = 0;\n        }\n\n        // Increment frequency (for old and new words).\n        freq[numFreq].frequency++;\n    }\n    numFreq++;\n    t2 = time(0);\n\n    // Sort frequency array.\n    qsort (freq, numFreq, sizeof (tFreq), compFn2);\n    t3 = time(0);\n\n\u00a0\n    // Output stats.\n    printf (\"Time taken for      sorting %5d elements was %d seconds.\\n\",\n        MAXWDS, t1 - t0);\n    printf (\"Time taken for transferring %5d elements was %d seconds.\\n\",\n        numFreq, t2 - t1);\n    printf (\"Time taken for      sorting %5d elements was %d seconds.\\n\",\n        numFreq, t3 - t2);\n    printf (\"Time taken for   everything %5s          was %d seconds.\\n\\n\",\n        \"\", t3 - t0);\n    for (i = 0; i < 28; i++) {\n        printf (\"[%-15s] %5d\\n\", freq[i].word, freq[i].frequency);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nAnd the output for 66,000 random strings is (the first few strings are there so you can see that the sort worked):\nTime taken for      sorting 66000 elements was 0 seconds.\nTime taken for transferring 62422 elements was 0 seconds.\nTime taken for      sorting 62422 elements was 0 seconds.\nTime taken for   everything                was 0 seconds.\n\n[Z              ]   105\n[H              ]    97\n[X              ]    95\n[P              ]    90\n[D              ]    89\n[K              ]    87\n[T              ]    86\n[J              ]    85\n[G              ]    84\n[F              ]    83\n[Q              ]    83\n[W              ]    81\n[V              ]    81\n[M              ]    80\n[I              ]    79\n[O              ]    78\n[A              ]    78\n[B              ]    75\n[U              ]    74\n[N              ]    73\n[C              ]    73\n[S              ]    70\n[Y              ]    68\n[L              ]    65\n[E              ]    60\n[R              ]    59\n[NQ             ]     8\n[XD             ]     8\n\nSo, even if you do those operations every single time you insert or delete a value, they will have no discernible impact (unless obviously, if you're doing it more than once every couple of seconds, but then you would think about batching the changes for efficiency).\n", "java - Query in Lucene": "\nI think you have to do this in two steps:\nStep 1: extract product ids\nBooleanQuery query = new BooleanQuery();\n\nquery.add(new TermQuery(\"attributeId\", 7), BooleanClause.Occur.MUST); \nquery.add(new TermQuery(\"value\", \"hindi\"), BooleanClause.Occur.MUST); \nTopDocs docs = searcher.search(query, null, searchLimit);\n\nYou then need to extract the productId from the docs\nStep 2: run query\nBooleanQuery query = new BooleanQuery();\n\nquery.add(new TermQuery(\"attributeId\", 10), BooleanClause.Occur.MUST); \nquery.add(new TermQuery(\"value\", \"Romance\"), BooleanClause.Occur.MUST); \n\n// build \"IN\" clause\nBooleanQuery pidQuery = new BooleanQuery();\nfor( long productId : productIds ){\n    pidQuery.add(new TermQuery(\"productId\", productId), BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD); \n}\nquery.add(pidQuery, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST); \nTopDocs docs = searcher.search(query, null, searchLimit);\n\n", "big o - Whats the least upper bound of the growth rate using big-Oh notation of these two functions": "\nn -> f(n) looks like O(c*n) = O(n)\nn -> g(n) ~ O(2*n^3) = O (n^3)\n", "c# - Data binding to SelectedItem in a WPF Treeview": "\nI realise this has already had an answer accepted, but I put this together to solve the problem.

VSS is pessimistic: merge conflicts are so hard to resolve that you avoid them with locking. So in svn, you don't need to know that a file is \"checked out\". You just check out a version without locking and edit as you like. Conflicts are resolved before commit, and usually svn resolves them automatically for you, unless two or more commits are modifying the same source lines.\nTherefore a \"status search\" is not really needed.\nSVN does support the notion of locking, which is useful for those hard-to-merge binary files. Even there the lock is not hard; it's merely a signal to other developers \"please do not commit while I'm editing this file.\" SVN GUIs have the option of locking a file. You can also enforce locking with the special svn:needs-lock property.\nSee the svnbook for more info on locking: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.2/svn.advanced.locking.html\n", "Powershell - calling remote WMI objects - RPC error HRESULT: 0x800706BA (RPC server not available)": "\n\nI got and error of \"RPC not available\", or unauthorized access.

If your exact same calls work for a local host but not over the internet, you've got a problem.\nIf you control the firewalls, you can look into restricting the ports that DCOM uses, and then opening up those ports.\nIf you're just using the wild internet, perhaps you might want to look into setting up a VPN, which I think should eliminate the 'Internet' issue?\n", "Query all user defined types from Sql Server?": "\nIn SQL Server 2005 (and above) you can do this\nSELECT * FROM sys.Types WHERE is_user_defined = 1\n\nIf you are on SQL Server 2000, you can use SysTypes.

Consequently, if you were allowed to declare a parameter as ref or out, there would be no way to keep the complete snapshot of the function at the time we had left off.\nEDIT: Technically, not all methods that return IEnumerable<T> are considered iterators. Just those that use yield to produce a sequence directly are considered iterators.

I've occasionally used this to set one value in the designer (eg. making its child controls all Visible in the designer) but override some of them to a different default value in the constructor (eg. hiding certain child controls which will only show in certain circumstances, such as an indicator on a status bar).\nHowever, the constructor does get executed if the control is placed as a child on another control or form in the designer.  OnLoad gets executed as well.  This may be how your logging code was getting accidentally triggered in the designer.\nFor detecting design vs runtime, an answer to another question has screenshots of some emperical tests showing the values returned by some common approaches.  It appears that a child control of a child control (two levels down) of the form or control being edited in the designer sees its own DesignMode == false, so the normal property check will fail to protect code (eg. in the OnLoad method) for controls nested within a control added in the designer.  If you were checking DesignMode as one would expect, it could be the nesting which caused it to get around that check.  It also always sees DesignMode == false within the constructor.\nAlso, note that the LicenseManager.UsageMode check only sees DesignTime within the constructor; when OnLoad is called it is within a RunTime LicenseContext.  The most complete solution seems to be to check LicenseManager.UsageMode in the constructor of the control or form (or component) and save the setting to a member variable or property which you can check later to avoid running code that should never run in the designer even when nested.

We weren't using neo4j, it was an in-house thing built on top of Berkeley DB, but it was similar. It was used in production (it still is).\nThe reason we used a graph database was that the data being stored by the system and the operations the system was doing with the data were exactly the weak spot of relational databases and were exactly the strong spot of graph databases. The system needed to store collections of objects that lack a fixed schema and are linked together by relationships. To reason about the data, the system needed to do a lot of operations that would be a couple of traversals in a graph database, but that would be quite complex queries in SQL.\nThe main advantages of the graph model were rapid development time and flexibility. We could quickly add new functionality without impacting existing deployments. If a potential customer wanted to import some of their own data and graft it on top of our model, it could usually be done on site by the sales rep. Flexibility also helped when we were designing a new feature, saving us from trying to squeeze new data into a rigid data model.\nHaving a weird database let us build a lot of our other weird technologies, giving us lots of secret-sauce to distinguish our product from those of our competitors. \nThe main disadvantage was that we weren't using the standard relational database technology, which can be a problem when your customers are enterprisey. Our customers would ask why we couldn't just host our data on their giant Oracle clusters (our customers usually had large datacenters). One of the team actually rewrote the database layer to use Oracle (or PostgreSQL, or MySQL), but it was slightly slower than the original. At least one large enterprise even had an Oracle-only policy, but luckily Oracle bought Berkeley DB. We also had to write a lot of extra tools - we couldn't just use Crystal Reports for example.\nThe other disadvantage of our graph database was that we built it ourselves, which meant when we hit a problem (usually with scalability) we had to solve it ourselves. If we'd used a relational database, the vendor would have already solved the problem ten years ago.\nIf you're building a product for enterprisey customers and your data fits into the relational model, use a relational database if you can. If your application doesn't fit the relational model but it does fit the graph model, use a graph database. If it only fits something else, use that.\nIf your application doesn't need to fit into the current blub architecture, use a graph database, or CouchDB, or BigTable, or whatever fits your app and you think is cool. It might give you an advantage, and its fun to try new things.\nWhatever you chose, try not to build the database engine yourself unless you really like building database engines.\n", "apache flex - Can I create server-side Java classes, OR mapping, and client-side AS classes from a single model description?": "\nYou can start here : http://www.graniteds.org/confluence/display/DOC/2.+Gas3+Code+Generator\n", "parsing - Formula in a database row - Java": "\nYou can use business rules engine to implement this instead of implementing your own parsing logic or writing a DSL.\nRefer to Business Rules Engine for details.

In VA Smalltalk, where Envy is used, the former approach is taken.  I believe Squeak would follow the latter approach using Monticello, but I'm not entirely certain.\nIn most Smalltalk implementations, it's easy to see both the original version of the overridden code, and the currently installed override.  \nIn client applications, overrides really only impact you when you update to a new version of Smalltalk from the venor (or the Squeak team, et. al.).  For server apps, where multiple applications may be resident in the server, you need to be much more careful about what you decide to do.\nOverrides (or monkey patches, as you call them) are a powerful tool, but you need to be careful about how you use them - and if you do use them, you should re-examine whether you still need them on a regular basis.

It's not like it reads the whole file and then guesses at what the encoding is.\nFrom the docs for StreamReader:\n\nThis constructor initializes the\n  encoding to UTF8Encoding, the\n  BaseStream property using the stream\n  parameter, and the internal buffer to\n  the default size.\nThe detectEncodingFromByteOrderMarks\n  parameter detects the encoding by\n  looking at the first three bytes of\n  the stream. It automatically\n  recognizes UTF-8, little-endian\n  Unicode, and big-endian Unicode text\n  if the file starts with the\n  appropriate byte order marks. See the\n  Encoding.GetPreamble method for more\n  information.\n\nNow File.Copy is just copying the raw bytes from place to place - it shouldn't change anything in terms of character encodings, because it doesn't try to interpret the file as a text file in the first place.\nIt's not quite clear to me where you see a problem (partly due to the ANSI/ASCII part). I suggest you separate out the issues of \"does File.Copy change things?\" and \"what character encoding is detected by StreamReader?\" in both your mind and your question. The answers should be:\n\nFile.Copy shouldn't change the contents of the file at all\nStreamReader can only detect UTF-8 and UTF-16; if you need to read a file encoded with any other encoding, you should state that explicitly in the constructor.

However if this data will only be used once in one way then it is probably overkill.\nYou would need to roll your own XML description of the data so SharePoint knows how to pull it from the database (or use something third party like Lightning Tools). As Colin mentioned it requires the Enterprise license of MOSS.\nSQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)\nIf Reporting Services is already available for use then this is the quickest and simplest solution. It works well but can get painful as more advanced features are required in your reports.\nYou should be able to use the Report Designer wizard to point to your table and set everything up for you. There are SSRS web parts that can be used within SharePoint, or indeed you can run SSRS inside SharePoint using SharePoint integration mode.\nApplication Page\nThis method Steven mentioned lets you integrate an ASP.NET application into SharePoint (such that it can be accessible by a URL within your SharePoint site). This allows anything that ASP.NET does, and the code-behind will be aware of SharePoint so you can tap into that if needed as well. The cons here are code access security and deployment.\nSee this webcast for how to do it.\nWeb Part\nSimilar to developing an application page but much more integrated with SharePoint. A custom web part is very powerful and allows you to integrate ASP.NET code on a SharePoint page. As you would know web parts can be dragged to whatever location and give a consistent properties pane. Again, code access security and deployment needs to be considered.\nIf you like designer view in Visual Studio then be aware this isn't the approach that Microsoft push. You can however use something like SmartPart where you would develop your custom app as a user control and the SmartPart wraps it into a web part. I'm used to doing it the MS way now and actually prefer the additional control this gives, however it can take more time.\nPage Viewer Web Part\nIf you don't want to touch your SharePoint installation at all then have a look at this web part. It takes a URL as parameter and displays an IFrame containing the page that would be your report, either in SSRS or standard ASP.NET.\nThe downside from this lack of integration is problems with sizing the IFrame, and possible security warnings from the browser if accessing the URL in a different domain.\n", "How to programmatically create MS Access table in SQL Server using SSIS?": "\nIs it an option to change the table structure?  For example if you had a child table with a column called Year and another called Value then there would be no need to keep adding new columns year on year.  It is good practice to store data in tables rows rather than in the column names.\nIt is also possible for example to use ADOX in MS-Acceess VBA to loop through the Fields Collection of the Access table and from this create a new table in SQL Server.  Code would be something like in this link but would need changing to work with a SQL Server connection etc.  \n", "c# - AD Provider Membership.GetUser() cause error saying: \"The parameter 'username' must not be empty.\"": "\nThe problem was that the current thread principal has not been set.\nAdding the follwing row:\nThread.CurrentPrincipal = new WindowsPrincipal(WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent());\nis initialize the current principlal and the GetUser() is back to work.\n", ".net - compling assemblies on a 64bit plaform for a 32bit": "\nUse AnyCPU.

Declare the file types as Document Types\nWithin your Xcode project, add a Document Type for all the file formats your application supports. Set the Role of each type according to your application's abilities:\n\nMark read/write capable file types as Editor;\nMark import only file types as Viewer.\n\nSet the Class to the document type you want to handle each file type. One document class can handle multiple file types.\nIn the example below, there are three file types declared: font-pestle, otf, and ttf. The first, font-pestle, is the native format of the application. This type has the role Editor.\nThe remaining two formats, otf and ttf, can be imported but not written by the application; thus they are marked as Viewer.\n\n2. Additional file types in your NSDocument subclass\nWith the Document Types added, the application will automatically allow users to open files of the specified types.\nYou need to add file type handling code to your document class. In the ideal case, add the branching code to the readFromData:ofType:error: method:\n- (BOOL)readFromData:(NSData*)someData ofType:(NSString*)typeName error:(NSError**)outError\n{\n    if ([NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace type:@\"eu.miln.font-pestle\" conformsToType:typeName] == YES)\n    {\n        // read native format\n    }\n    else if ([NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace type:@\"public.opentype-font\" conformsToType:typeName] == YES)\n    {\n        // read import only format\n\n        // disassociate document from file; makes document \"untitled\"\n        self.fileURL = nil;\n        // associate with primary file type\n        self.fileType = @\"eu.miln.font-pestle\";\n\n    }\n    else // ...\n\n}\n\nThe self.fileURL = nil; is important. By setting fileURL to nil, you are saying the document is not associated with any on-disk file and should be treated as a new document.\nTo allow auto-saving, implement the NSDocument method autosavingFileType to return the primary file type.\n", "ajax - Firefox not displaying the form": "\nYour generated DOM is invalid. Character data (text) and <br>, <form> and <script> elements may not be child elements of  elements - only <tbody>, <thead> and <tfoot> element may (although in XHTML you can have <tr> elements too).\nFor those elements to exist inside a table, they must appear entirely within a table cell.\nGiven broken HTML, Firefox will do a good job of compensating for author errors, but when the broken DOM is generated with JS, you bypass some of the autocorrection routines.\nAs an aside, your Doctype (HTML + Transitional + No system identifier) triggers Quirks mode - which doesn't generally help matters.\nI suggest:\n\nSwitch to a Doctype that triggers Standards mode\nValidate your markup\nBuild the content you are adding with JavaScript using plain HTML instead\nMake that validate\nWrite JavaScript to generate the DOM you have now tested as being valid\n\n", "c# - Weird problem with an SQL exception truncate string or binary data": "\nCan you give any indication what you are doing at this point? One option would be i18n issues - i.e. does the 2008 server have different regional settings to your machine? this might mean that you are building some TSQL that is different (for example, formatting a date differently), and it no longer fits in the specified field (varchar(10), for example, will take some date formats but not others). Of course, the real fix here is to use a datetime - but this is just an example!\nI think your best bet comes from doing a sql trace using the sql development tools; this will make it obvious what is actually being sent.\n", "RAILS: Authlogic gem & Userstamp plugin": "\nWell, I just found it out the hard way. ;-)\nIf you use Authlogic (2.0.11) in combination with Userstamp (2.0) make sure that Authlogic's current_user method in the ActionController is protected and not private (as is the default). Or you'll get a NoMethodError in User sessionsController#new.\nBesides that it just works like a charm.\nP.S.: There's no need to manually implement the set_stamper method in the ActionController. Authlogic and Userstamp work well with the method defined by the Userstamp plugin. If you've no idea what I'm talking about, just ignore this. :-)\n", "c++ - Is there a faster way to detect object type at runtime than using dynamic_cast?": "\nI always look on the use of dynamic_cast as a code smell. You can replace it in all circumstances with polymorphic behaviour and improve your code quality. In your example I would do something like this:\nclass GenericClass\n{\n  virtual void DoStuff()\n  {\n    // do interesting stuff here\n  }\n};\n\nclass InterestingDerivedClass : public GenericClass\n{\n  void DoStuff()\n  {\n    // do nothing\n  }\n};\n\nclass CallbackImpl : public ICallback {\n    void DoStuff( GenericClass* param ) {\n        param->DoStuff();\n    }\n}\n\nIn your case, you cannot modify the target classes, you are programming to a contract implied by the declaration of the GenericClass type. Therefore, there is unlikely to be anything that you can do that would be faster than dynamic_cast would be, since anything else would require modifying the client code.\n", "php - Firefox shows waiting cursor and \"loading..\" even after post request is complete": "\nCould it be a firefox specific bug as none of the other browsers are exhibiting it ?

The Oracle SQL Reference just refers to updating a subquery.  I tend to think of it as a form of \"view updating\", with the subquery being in in-line view.\nYes, it works when a number of tables are joined, but subject to the rules of view updating. This means that only one of the view's base tables can be updated, and this table must be \"key-preserved\" in the view: i.e. its rows should only be able to appear once in the view.  This requires that any other tables in the view (subquery) are referenced via foreign key constraints on the table to be updated.  \nSome examples may help.  Using the standard Oracle EMP and DEPT tables, with EMP.EMPNO being defined as the primary key of EMP, and EMP.DEPTNO being defined as a foreign key to DEPT.DEPTNO, then this update is allowed:\nupdate (select emp.empno, emp.ename, emp.sal, dept.dname\n        from   emp join dept on dept.deptno = emp.deptno\n       )\nset sal = sal+100;\n\nBut this is not:\n-- DEPT is not \"key-preserved\" - same DEPT row may appear\n-- several times in view\nupdate (select emp.ename, emp.sal, dept.deptno, dept.dname\n        from   emp join dept on dept.deptno = emp.deptno\n       )\nset dname = upper(dname);\n\nAs for performance: the optimiser will (must) identify the base table to be updated during parsing, and joins to other table will be ignored since they do not have any bearing on the update to be performed - as this AUTOTRACE output shows:\nSQL> update (select emp.ename, emp.sal, dept.dname\n  2              from   emp join dept on dept.deptno = emp.deptno\n  3             )\n  4      set sal = sal-1;\n\n33 rows updated.\n\n\nExecution Plan\n----------------------------------------------------------\nPlan hash value: 1507993178\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Id  | Operation           | Name         | Rows  | Bytes | Cost (%CPU)| Time     |\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|   0 | UPDATE STATEMENT    |              |    33 |   495 |     3   (0)| 00:00:01 |\n|   1 |  UPDATE             | EMP          |       |       |            |          |\n|   2 |   NESTED LOOPS      |              |    33 |   495 |     3   (0)| 00:00:01 |\n|   3 |    TABLE ACCESS FULL| EMP          |    33 |   396 |     3   (0)| 00:00:01 |\n|*  4 |    INDEX UNIQUE SCAN| SYS_C0010666 |     1 |     3 |     0   (0)| 00:00:01 |\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPredicate Information (identified by operation id):\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n   4 - access(\"EMP\".\"DEPTNO\"=\"DEPT\".\"DEPTNO\")\n\n(Note that table DEPT is never accessed even though DEPT.DNAME appears in the subquery).\n", "seo - Some undesired words appeared in Google's snippets, how to get read of it?": "\nIncluding the price in the snippet is actually very desirable for most people.

Know what's critical to it's success and then use that list to see if any software, language, or tool will aid it, and at what cost, and if the cost outweighs the benefit.\n1) Use a crammer's schedule.

It's amazing how much doesn't matter anymore when you have to do 50% of the features at 100% of the quality. Focus on value, value, value.    Read something like 37 Signal's book Getting Real for more on this.\n2) Do not re-invent the wheel.  It's always easier it seems to build something from scratch.  Unless you are doing a fraction of the implementation and it's truly simpler, meaning you can avoid abstraction until you forget what you were building, consider it.  If you can build it faster, better, cheaper and in the same amount of time, do it. \n3) Know the features of your tools, and the benefits any tools need to give your solution.

Our goal was to get a developer up and running on a clean PC within 15 minutes including the time it takes to install dependent software like the IDE or a local database. In the end we came close with some time to tweak the local configuration as per below.\nThe problem is the .IPR file stores more settings than a .sln file -eg settings for individual plugins. So a major cause for the overwrites is if a developer with a different plugin configuration opens the IPR file some default settings for the plugin are written to the file. We felt developers should not have to restrict themselves to a given plugin super set (just a minimum configuration).\nThe way we alleviated the problem (although not entirely solved) was to switch to the .idea folder format. This takes the content of the .IPR file and splits many of the nodes into individual files and folders in the .idea sub-folder. From here we were able to exclude many of the frequently written to files from source control. Some of the files we excluded were:\n\nworkspace.xml\ndataSources.xml\nsqlDataSources.xml\ndynamic.xml\n\nSome files we'd like IntelliJ to leave alone are (although the blame can also go to the plugin developers and not just Jetbrains):\n\nprojectCodeStyle.xml (so we can get consistent code formatting in the project - again this can be overwritten based on a developer's local plugin mix).\nany file under the runConfigurations folder. It can be time consuming to configure run configurations particularly if you have a complex app with many facets. The most commonly stupid thing that gets changed by simply opening the IDE or building is the \"DEBUG_PORT\" option under RunnerSettings. My opinion is if it's dynamically allocated why not have a value of \"Dynamic\"?\nmisc.xml. This file also contains plugin configuration. Some settings look handy to share and others look more for personal config. Eg the IvyIDEA plugin puts an absolute path to your ivy config file.\nThe module files. These are mostly left alone but an example of needless overwritting is the IvyIDEA plugin putting details of the local ivy-cache location in this file. But again this is the plugin's fault and not really Jetbrains.\n\nHope this helps.\nChristian.\n", "language agnostic - How to test if matrix is diagonal?": "\nIt would be much better to just traverse all the off-diagonal elements and test if they are near zero (comparing a floating-point number for inequality is prone to rounding errors and can lead to erroneous results).\nFirst, once you find any violating element you can immediately stop traversing and this may allow for significant time decrease if violating matrices are typical.\nSecond, it would potentially allow for better loop unrolling by the compiler (Fortran compilers are known for good optimization strategies) and for faster on-chip execution due to less inter-instruction dependencies.\nAdd to this the fact that your suggested algorithm is prone to overflows and error accumulation and the \"traverse-and-test\" algorithm is not.\n", "How to use activity indicator view on iPhone?": "\nCreate:\nspinner = [[UIActivityIndicatorView alloc] initWithActivityIndicatorStyle:UIActivityIndicatorViewStyleWhiteLarge];\n[spinner setCenter:CGPointMake(kScreenWidth/2.0, kScreenHeight/2.0)]; // I do this because I'm in landscape mode\n[self.view addSubview:spinner]; // spinner is not visible until started\n\nStart:\n[spinner startAnimating]; \n\nStop:\n [spinner stopAnimating];\n\nWhen you're finally done, remove the spinner from the view and release.\n", "objective c - Problem with rotating clock needle": "\nYour code uses a timer to start a CAAnimation every second.

Even then I'm not sure it was possible.\nToday, Windows doesn't delegate the invocation of the next hook in the chain to you (thus the deprecated parameter to CallNextHookEx) and HHOOKs don't let you reach out to hooks you didn't register anymore.\n\nMore properly, there is no good and supported way to do this.\nYou could install a rootkit, dig deep into Windows internals and find the hook chain that way; but that's obviously going to ridiculous - and dangerous - lengths.\nHooking (via one of the myriad API hooking solutions out there, Detours seems popular) SetWindowsHookEx and CallNextHookEx can get you most of the way there for applications that conform to pre-NT conventions.  The gist is to immediately unhook new hooks after calls to SetWindowsHookEx, unhook any passed hooks (that aren't your own) to CallNextHookEx.  To guarantee a \"clean\" application, you'd also have to simulate a number of events to force any already called hooks to be invoked so they can be unhooked.  Also, this regime will fail as soon as you encounter any of the applications written in the last 8+ years that pass NULL to CallNextHookEx.\nSo even though it is technically possible (maybe) to unhook HHOOKs your app didn't register, you're probably better off trying to accomplish whatever it is you're after a different, less horribly brittle way.\n", "python - list() doesn't work in Google App Engine?": "\nIt seems like you implemented your own list() function.

I was able to get it setup in a matter of an hour or two and had basic security using my database over a few different pages. Your mileage may vary of course, but worst case scenario you have their full fledged tutorial you can poke and prod to see how it reacts.\nSecondly, the library is very configurable.

The ItemsSource property is the ItemsControl.ItemsSource property.  And it merely requires that whatever it's bound to implements IEnumerable.\nKeyedCollection does implement IEnumerable, as it implements Collection.\nHere's a short sample using a KeyedCollection:\n<Grid>\n    <DockPanel x:Name=\"QuickListButtonsStackPanel\">\n        <Button DockPanel.Dock=\"Top\"\n                Content=\"Load Animals\"\n                Click=\"AnimalButtonClick\" />\n        <Button DockPanel.Dock=\"Top\"\n                Content=\"Load Objects\"\n                Click=\"ObjectButtonClick\" />\n\n        <TextBlock DockPanel.Dock=\"Bottom\"\n                   Background=\"Azure\"\n                   Text=\"{Binding SelectedExample}\" />\n\n        <ListBox x:Name=\"uiListBox\"\n                 ItemsSource=\"{Binding Examples}\"\n                 SelectedItem=\"{Binding SelectedExample}\" />\n\n    </DockPanel>\n</Grid>\n\nAnd the code for our Window & KeyedCollection:\npublic partial class Window1 : Window, INotifyPropertyChanged\n{\n    public Window1()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n        this.DataContext = this;\n    }\n\n    public KeyedCollection<char, string> Examples\n    {\n        get;\n        set;\n    }\n\n    private string mySelectedExample;\n    public string SelectedExample\n    {\n        get\n        { return this.mySelectedExample; }\n        set\n        {\n            this.mySelectedExample = value;\n            this.NotifyPropertyChanged(\"SelectedExample\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void AnimalButtonClick(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        Examples = new AlphabetExampleCollection();\n        Examples.Add(\"Ardvark\");\n        Examples.Add(\"Bat\");\n        Examples.Add(\"Cat\");\n        Examples.Add(\"Dingo\");\n        Examples.Add(\"Emu\");\n\n        NotifyPropertyChanged(\"Examples\");\n    }\n\n    private void ObjectButtonClick(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        Examples = new AlphabetExampleCollection();\n        Examples.Add(\"Apple\");\n        Examples.Add(\"Ball\");\n        Examples.Add(\"Chair\");\n        Examples.Add(\"Desk\");\n        Examples.Add(\"Eee PC\");\n\n        NotifyPropertyChanged(\"Examples\");\n    }\n\n\n\n    #region INotifyPropertyChanged Members\n\n    private void NotifyPropertyChanged(String info)\n    {\n        if (PropertyChanged != null)\n        {\n            PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(info));\n        }\n    }\n\n    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;\n\n    #endregion\n}\n\npublic class AlphabetExampleCollection : KeyedCollection<char, string>\n{\n    public AlphabetExampleCollection() : base() { }\n\n    protected override char GetKeyForItem(string item)\n    {\n        return Char.ToUpper(item[0]);\n    }\n}\n\nThe other issue that may be occurring is if you are just adding/removing items from the collection, and not re-setting the collection.  In the example above, you can see that we are re-instating the keyed collection.  If we didn't do this, then just calling NotifyPropertyChanged wouldn't do anything.  \nLets add in two more buttons to demonstrate this:\n<Button DockPanel.Dock=\"Top\"\n        Content=\"Add Zebra\"\n        Click=\"AddZebraClick\" />\n<Button DockPanel.Dock=\"Top\"\n        Content=\"Add YoYo\"\n        Click=\"AddYoYoClick\" />\n\nAnd the Hanlders:\nprivate void AddZebraClick(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    Examples.Add(\"Zebra\");\n    NotifyPropertyChanged(\"Examples\");\n}\n\nprivate void AddYoYoClick(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    Examples.Add(\"YoYo\");\n    NotifyPropertyChanged(\"Examples\");\n}\n\nBoth of these, as is will not work.  When you call NotifyPropertyChanged the property has to actually be changed.  And in this case, it is not.  We've modified it's items, but the Examples collection is still the same collection. To fix this we could cycle the collection as we did in the first part, or if we have access to the UI, we could call:             \nuiListBox.Items.Refresh();\n\nWe could also cycle the DataSource, we could cycle the ListBox's ItemsSource, or we could clear and re-assign the binding but just calling UpdateTarget() won't do it however.\n", ".net - SQL 2005 XML Special/Escaped Characters from System.Xml.XmlDocument.OuterXml": "\nIf you've got an XmlDocument with invalid characters in, you basically haven't got valid XML.

Recent versions of restful auth are much better than earlier versions which spewed code left, right and centre but my advice would be where possible leave the user and session code generated by restful auth well alone.

Part of the reason for this is that Objective-C was originally a very thin runtime layer on top of C, and added objects to C with minimum fuss. Unfortunately for us now, naming conflicts are something we have to deal with when using Objective-C. You win some, you lose some...\nOne small clarification (although it's not much for consolation) is that Objective-C actually has two flat namespaces \u2014 one for classes and one for protocols (like Java's interfaces). This doesn't solve any class naming conflicts, but it does mean you can have a protocol and class with the same name (like <NSObject> and NSObject) where the latter usually adopts (\"implements\") the former. This feature can prevent \"Foo / FooImpl\" pattern rampant in Java, but sadly doesn't help with class conflicts.\nQuestion 2: How to [name] and organize Objective-C classes?\nNaming\nThe following rules are subjective, but they are decent guidelines for naming Objective-C classes.\n\nIf your code can't be run by other code (it's not a framework, plugin, etc. but an end-user application or tool) you only need to avoid conflicts with code you link against. Often, this means you can get away with no prefix at all, so long as the frameworks/plugins/bundles you use have proper namespaces.\nIf you're developing \"componentized\" code (like a framework, plugin, etc.) you should choose a prefix (hopefully one that's unique) and document your use of it someplace visible so others know to avoid potential conflicts. For example, the CocoaDev wiki \"registry\" is a de facto public forum for calling \"dibs\" on a prefix. However, if your code is something like a company-internal framework, you may be able to use a prefix that someone else already does, so long as you aren't using anything with that prefix.\n\nOrganization\nOrganizing source files on disk is something that many Cocoa developers unfortunately gloss over. When you create a new file in Xcode, the default location is the project directory, right beside your project file, etc. Personally, I put application source in source/, test code (OCUnit, etc.) in test/, all the resources (NIB/XIB files, Info.plist, images, etc.) in resources/, and so on. If you're developing a complex project, grouping source code in a hierarchy of directories based on functionality can be a good solution, too. In any case, a well-organized project directory makes it easier to find what you need.\nXcode really doesn't care where your files are located. The organization in the project sidebar is completely independent of disk location \u2014 it is a logical (not physical) grouping. You can organize however you like in the sidebar without affecting disk location, which is nice when your source is stored in version control. On the other hand, if you move the files around on disk, patching up Xcode references is manual and tedious, but can be done. It's easiest to create your organization from the get-go, and create files in the directory where they belong.\nMy Opinion\nAlthough it could be nice to have a package/namespace mechanism, don't hold your breath for it to happen. Class conflicts are quite rare in practice, and are generally glaringly obvious when they happen. Namespaces are really a solution for a non-problem in Objective-C. (In addition, adding namespaces would obviate the need for workarounds like prefixes, but could introduce a lot more complexity in method invocation, etc.)\nThe more subtle and devious bugs come from method conflicts when methods are added and/or overridden, not only by subclasses, but also be categories, which can cause nasty errors, since the load order of categories is undefined (nondeterministic). Implementing categories is one of the sharpest edges of Objective-C, and should only be attempted if you know what you're doing, particularly for third-party code, and especially for Cocoa framework classes.\n", "SQL Server 2008 Licensing when splitting Report Manager and Report Service on different machines": "\nYou need a license for each client accessing the reporting manager. The Report Manager will fall into the 'multiplexing' category, no matter on which machine is installed.

It mentions how descendant selectors are inefficient because once the rightmost selector has been matched \"the browser must [also] traverse up the DOM tree, evaluating every ancestor element until it finds a match or reaches the root element.\"  Mozilla even says \"the descendant selector is the most expensive selector in CSS.\"  So div.photo-column{...} would be preferable to div.result-row div.photo-column{...}.  \nIt also mentions that you should remove redundant qualifiers such as \"class selectors qualified by tag selectors (when a class is only used for one tag, which is a good design practice anyway).\"  That makes sense because if you have div.photo-column{...} instead of .photo-column{...} the browser has to make two checks, one to check for class=\"photo-column\" and, if that's true, one to check if the element is a div, rather than just checking for the class, if that's all you specify.    \n", "algorithm - php list into a table": "\nWhat you're gonna need to do is add columns while you're iterating through the rows.

You can even use the \"loading\" class to show some fancy background, like a spinning circle of dots in Mozilla.\nAlso some projects use another method of loading scripts instead of \"onLoad\". First you create a global array, let's say, named \"domReady\".\nwindow.domReady = [];\n\nAnd when you need to add some function that will be run on page load, you just push it into this array:\nwindow.domReady.push( function foo(){ alert('Hey!'); } );\n\nAnd at the last line of the document you put the function that will run all the pushed procedures:\nfor (procedure in window.domReady) {\n    window.domReady[procedure].call();\n}\n\nSince it will be the last line of the document before the closing  tag, the DOM will be ready, and you won't have to wait until all the images are loaded.\n", "What's the most efficient way to do weighted fulltext search in MYSQL?": "\nuse thinking sphinx, http://freelancing-god.github.com/ts/en/\n", "Is it possible to load a separate application into the iphone?": "\nYou'll need to register as an iPhone developer to get the correct keys for signing and loading an application onto an iPhone.

Give it a Int, it will return a Int. Give it a Person, it will return a Person.\nIn C#, you can't be so sure. This is that 'function' in C#:\npublic T Id<T>(T x);\n\nNow, because of subtyping you could call it like so:\nvar pers = Id<Person>(new Student());\n\nWhile pers is of type Person, the argument to the Id function is not. In fact pers might have a more specific type than just Person. Person could even be an abstract type, guaranteeing that pers will have a more specific type.\nAs you can see, even with a function as simple as id the .NET type system already allows for a lot more than the stricter type system from Haskell. While that might be useful to do some programming work, it also makes it harder to reason about a program by just looking a the types of things (which is a joy to do in Haskell).\n\nAnd a second thing, there is ad hoc polymorphism (aka overloading) in Haskell, via a mechanism known as 'type classes'.\nequals :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool\n\nThis function checks if two values are equal. But not just any two values, just the values that have instances for the Eq class. This is sort of like constraints on type parameters in C#:\npublic bool Equals<T>(T x, T y) where T : IComparable\n\nThere is a difference, however. For one thing, the subtyping: you could instantiate it with Person and call it with Student and Teacher.\nBut there is also a difference in what this compiles to. The C# code compiles to almost exactly what its type says. The type checker makes sure the arguments implement the proper interface, and than you're good.\nWhereas the Haskell code complies to something like this:\nequals :: EqDict -> a -> a -> Bool\n\nThe function gets an extra argument, a dictionary of all the functions it needs to do the Eq things. Here's how you could use this function, and what it compiles to:\nb1 = equals 2 4          --> b1 = equals intEqFunctions 2 4\nb2 = equals True False   --> b2 = equals boolEqFunctions True False\n\nThis also shows what makes subtyping such a pain, imagine if this where possible.\nb3 = equals someStudent someTeacher\n     --> b3 = equals personEqFunctions someStudent someTeacher\n\nHow is the personEqFunctions dictionary supposed to figure out if a Student is equal to a Teacher? They don't even have the same fields.\nIn short, while Haskell type constraints at first sight might look like .NET type constraints, they are implemented completely differently and compile to two really different things.\n", "c - Content for Linux Operating Systems Class": "\nMy list:\n\nWhat an operating system's concerns are: Abstraction and extension of the physical machine and resource management.\nHow the build process works ie, how architecture specific/machine code stuff is implanted\nHow system calls work and how modules can link up\nMemory management / Virtual Memory / Paging and all the rest\nHow processes are born, live and die in POSIX and other systems\nuserspace vs kernel threads and what the difference is between process/threads\nWhy the monolithic Kernel design is growing tiresome and what are the alternatives\nScheduling (and some of the alternative / domain specific schedulers)\nI/O, Driver development and how they are dynamically loaded\nThe early stages of booting and what the kernel does to setup the environment\nProblems with clocks, mmu-less systems etc\n...

There are two common answers:\n\nfor efficiency: to avoid my function\ncalls being virtual.\nfor safety: to ensure that my class is not used as a\nbase class (for example, to be sure\nthat I can copy objects without fear\nof slicing)\n\nIn my experience, the efficiency reason is usually misplaced fear. In C++, virtual function calls are so fast that their real-world use for a class designed with virtual functions does not to produce measurable run-time overheads compared to alternative solutions using ordinary function calls. Note that the virtual function call mechanism is typically used only when calling through a pointer or a reference. When calling a function directly for a named object, the virtual function class overhead is easily optimized away.\nIf there is a genuine need for \"capping\" a class hierarchy to avoid virtual function calls, one might ask why those functions are virtual in the first place. I have seen examples where performance-critical functions had been made virtual for no good reason, just because \"that's the way we usually do it\".\nThe other variant of this problem, how to prevent derivation for logical reasons, has a solution. Unfortunately, that solution is not pretty. It relies on the fact that the most derived class in a hierarchy must construct a virtual base. For example:\nclass Usable;\n\nclass Usable_lock {\n    friend class Usable;\nprivate:\n    Usable_lock() {}\n    Usable_lock(const Usable_lock&) {}\n};\n\nclass Usable : public virtual Usable_lock {\n    // ...\npublic:\n    Usable();\n    Usable(char*);\n    // ...\n};\n\nUsable a;\n\nclass DD : public Usable { };\n\nDD dd;  // error: DD::DD() cannot access\n        // Usable_lock::Usable_lock(): private  member\n\n(from D&E sec 11.4.3). \n", "hibernate cascade deletion": "\nTry\ncascade=\"all-delete-orphan\"\n\n", "performance - Linq to SQL : Optimizing queries with Sql Server Compact Edition": "\nIt seems like your problem is sql index/foreign key performance vs. collection iterator performance.\nLinq to Datasets does offer a way to preserve relationships (more specifically, ADO.net Datasets have a relationship collection) and can enforce primary key, foreign key, and unique constraints.

It looks like in the 11 years sense this question has been posted, there has been work done in this direction.  Here is a link:\nhttps://www.groundai.com/project/a-neural-based-program-decompiler/1\nAnd here is the abstract\nA Neural-based Program Decompiler\n\nReverse engineering of binary executables is a critical problem in the computer security domain. On the one hand, malicious parties may recover interpretable source codes from the software products to gain commercial advantages. On the other hand, binary decompilation can be leveraged for code vulnerability analysis and malware detection. However, efficient binary decompilation is challenging. Conventional decompilers have the following major limitations: (i) they are only applicable to specific source-target language pair, hence incurs undesired development cost for new language tasks; (ii) their output high-level code cannot effectively preserve the correct functionality of the input binary; (iii) their output program does not capture the semantics of the input and the reversed program is hard to interpret. To address the above problems, we propose Coda111Coda is the abbreviation for CodeAttack., the first end-to-end neural-based framework for code decompilation. Coda decomposes the decompilation task into of two key phases: First, Coda employs an instruction type-aware encoder and a tree decoder for generating an abstract syntax tree (AST) with attention feeding during the code sketch generation stage. Second, Coda then updates the code sketch using an iterative error correction machine guided by an ensembled neural error predictor. By finding a good approximate candidate and then fixing it towards perfect, Coda achieves superior performance compared to baseline approaches. We assess Coda\u2019s performance with extensive experiments on various benchmarks. Evaluation results show that Coda achieves an average of 82% program recovery accuracy on unseen binary samples, where the state-of-the-art decompilers yield 0% accuracy. Furthermore, Coda outperforms the sequence-to-sequence model with attention by a margin of 70% program accuracy. Our work reveals the vulnerability of binary executables and imposes a new threat to the protection of Intellectual Property (IP) for software development.\n\n", "algorithm - Goal Seek functionality in PHP": "\nThere is a bit (a little bit) about what Goal Seek does here, on the Microsoft support site.

To get the correct results for search, you need apply language identification to the search query and use that analyzer. \nThe upside here is you will be able to use language-specific stemmer & stopwords, pushing the quality of search up. The extra overhead while indexing should be acceptable. The search queries where language identification fails to identify correct language may suffer though.

Focus is not lost when selecting autocomplete values.\nEssentially, there does not appear to be any way to reasonably guarantee the event will be processed the way you want. \nFirst off, do you really need to listen to every keystroke?\nSecondly, would you be better served by turning off autocomplete?\n(e.g. <input type='text' value='abc' autocomplete='off' onkeyup='changeSomething(this);' />)\n", "html - Asp.Net MVC: Forms being block elements": "\nWhen you post a form, the name attribute of the button used to post it is sent as a form value.
