My \"bounty rep stash\" would go down, but not drastically decrease, and would probably stay somewhat even with the rate I ask questions.  \nThis is just an example using myself as an example, but I bet it applies to others as well.

If you're going to scale a SQL Server database fast to a large audience at a low cost, you don't want any extraneous business logic in the database.  No triggers, no UDFs, no CLR code, no record-by-record operations.\nNormally when I do performance tuning for clients, I start tracing queries with a duration of more than 10 seconds.  At Stack Overflow, I have to crank my filters down to 150-200 ms just to see any activity. It always gives me a grin.\nJust generally speaking, application servers are cheap, and SQL Server is expensive ($5k-$25k per CPU).  Even if you use open source databases, it's easier to scale application servers than it is to scale database servers.  Every added web/application server is relatively easy to implement with a load balancer - every added database server, not so much.

Teams, and Ads in the form of normal ads and Employer Branding.  Is that money enough?  That's wholly unclear since it's now in private hands that aren't as forthcoming about their revenue and designs as the original founders were.\nTalent (as we knew it) is gone. Careers (as we knew it) is gone.\nThe original answer is still relevant in its broad strokes; but going forward I anticipate we'll see more direct monetization attempts.\nOriginal Answer (2009)\nStack Overflow as a business model is highly dependent upon its advertising model -- which is directly related to the value of advertising on the internet.\nIn an effort to branch out from this dependency, They've released the \"Stack Exchange\" product as well as careers.stackoverflow.com and jobs.stackoverflow.com.\nI'll discuss each in turn.\nAdvertising: The tried-and-true business model of the internet. In times of recession, ad-revenue is down across the board, but it's still the lowest friction way to make money.  It requires the least resources from a business perspective.\nStack Exchange: This one puzzles me.  I don't know if Stack Overflow LLC licenses the Stack Overflow source code to FogCreek (which would seem to make the most 'legal' sense since they are two separate entities) or if they 'sold' it outright.  Or, as a third alternative, they have a business agreement that allows for a split of the revenues and they promise to share the improvements to the source code model.\nThe main problem with Stack Exchange is that it is an unproven business model.  How many 'pay for private knowledge exhcange' sites do you know of?  The cost is also subject to change.  If they charge too much, they make too little, but if they don't charge enough, they don't make nearly as much.  It's also dependent upon how the people that use it either monetize it, or write it off as a business expense.  The latter depends upon Stack Exchange bringing some sort of business value that justifies the expense.  Only time will tell.\nJobs:  As Joel points out the jobs board brought about 1 million in revenue in its first year.  I can only assume it brings in more now -- and with Stack Overflow and its sister sites, I'm sure Stack Overflow LLC gets a cut of that revenue as well.\nCareers: The first effort by Stack Overflow LLC that doesn't seem dependent on Fog Creek support (even the monetization of Stack Exchange requires Fog Creek support, as Aaron is a Fog Creek employee).  It requires that developers and businesses pay to get a seemingly 'high quality' pool of applicants.  It deserves its shot; but I'm leery since it's trying something very new (charging applicants!).\nSuccess is a subjective factor, but business success isn't.  Stack Overflow is able to pay three employees (not including the Ad guy) and cover its hosting cost.  It's currently the new hotness in the programming world.  Where else can you have Jon Skeet, Eric Lippert, Alan Kay, Joel Spolsky, Jason Cohen, Jeff Atwood, and many other 'rockstars' of our industry participate on a daily basis?  It sounds like hero worship, but the quality they bring is immeasurable.

Downvotes take reputation and upvotes give it. But reputation is still how you get privileges. And that's a problem.\nAt this moment, I've got about 970 MSE rep. If I post a number of suggestions that I see as perfectly valid, but the people on MSE don't want to see adopted, I lose a lot of rep. It's not necessarily that the ideas are bad; all it would take is that they were not\u2026 accepted among the community. And thus, simply by adding ideas to the site, I'm pushed farther away from greater privileges.\nIndeed, there have been some MSE conversations that I've been reluctant to even consider bringing up, in part for these reasons. Questions about what forums are, what SE is, whether forums still have a place in a post-SE world, how best SE-style sites should build a community, the nature of a SE-based community vs. a forum, etc. My views on these issues would certainly be \u2026 controversial and in some ways antithetical to the prevailing wind of the people on MSE.\nSo if I were to talk about them, I lose rep. Not because I'm right or wrong, but simply because of the general feelings of the collective of people on MSE.\nAnd that would be fine\u2026 if rep didn't give me abilities. The ability to create tags, to cast close votes, to see the up/down votes on a question/answer, unreviewed edits, etc.\nFor regular SE sites, reputation is a relative measure of the actual worth of the person. A person who has high rep has contributed significantly to the site. And thus, this person is more deserving of powers over the site. On MSE, this is not the case.\nSo my suggestion is this: leave the rep the same, but make MSE privileges based on the privileges you have for the highest rep site on your account. Since MSE is effectively shared (it's the default discussion place for Stack Exchange), it makes sense that being a member in good standing for any Stack Exchange site would transfer over. So if you are a 10,000 rep user of Super User, you would have the same privileges on MSE.\n", "Adding incntiv for diting - Mta Stack Exchang": "\nI think there is already sufficient encouragement to get people to edit posts.\n\nPeople edit because they earned that ability (sufficient reputation to allow editing).\nThere is a badge awarded for editing a certain number of post.\nRecognition - The post is marked as \"edited\" and tagged with their name.\nSome people just find an intrinsic reward by helping out and adding to the site.\n\nThere are currently over 1,800 people with \"editor\" status on StackOverflow.

When Meta Stack Overflow replaced UserVoice, the number of feature-requests exploded:\n\nPrivate message system unlocked by reputation\n\nWhy don't we have instant messaging on Stack Exchange?\n\nIs there a way to contact another member of stack overflow?\n\nIs there plans for an IM Capability?\n\nRequest a specific expert on a subject to answer your question\n\nFeature Request: \"WAKE UP and accept my answer please\"\n\nMy Social Network Integration for Private Messaging, Commenting, Etc\n\nhow can I get in touch with a stackoverflow member privately?\n\nMany, many more\n\n\nThe consistent response to this is that it's a bad idea, because:\n\nIt could hide information from the community: useful information transmitted privately is unavailable to other readers, subverting the core purpose of the site.\n\nIt could be used to harass other users (\"Answer my question!\", \"Accept my answer!\", \"Yer momma so fat she overflows the stack!\", etc...)\n\n\nHowever, there is some value in being able to communicate with other users outside the context of a specific question or answer. This point was conceded with the implementation of a chat system: users on every Stack Exchange site can create and participate in chat rooms, integrated with the normal user accounts. There are still no truly private messages between users, but for those who want to chew the fat or discuss whatever outside the confines of the sites themselves, this can provide a viable solution.\nFinally, it became apparent that moderators occasionally need to contact users about sensitive topics, and relying on email for this created problems. So the ability for moderators to send a private message to another user was implemented. The use of these messages are heavily restricted, reviewed by the system administrators, and reserved for critical messages only.\nFor normal users, the advice remains: if you want others to be able to contact you privately, add basic contact info to your profile's bio page.\n", "Do all meta stackoverflow bug, feature request, and discussion eventually get reviewed by a moderator?": "\nI periodically review...\nHighly voted bugs with no status assigned\nhttps://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged?tagnames=bug%20-status-~&sort=votes\nHighly voted all feature requests with no status assigned\nhttps://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged?tagnames=feature-request%20-status-~&sort=votes\nIf you want something implemented, then vote for it!\nI also highly recommend you check out what is currently planned as well.\nhttps://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/status-planned\n", "What kind of edits contribute to the editor badges?": "\nWhat is included\n\ncommunity-wiki posts\ntag wikis and excerpts\n\nWhat is NOT included (only applies to Strunk & White and Copy Editor)\n\nedits to your own posts\nedits to tags \n\nTo count for S&W/Copy Editor, the edit must cover the title, the body or both.\n", "Etiquette of screen-scraping Stack Overflow": "\nWe have scripts that check for unusual / abusive access patterns, and a daily \"top n\" traffic summary report of inordinate and anomalous usage.\nWe regularly block (IP range ban) unknown scrapers that do not identify themselves and/or have poor behavior patterns.

For example, one scraper used 120 megabytes of bandwidth in only 3,310 hits which is substantial.

The site goes to great lengths to keep voting data private, and I support that. Jeff strongly had in mind the AOL data dump debacle (google it if you're not familiar) in which AOL thought they had anonymised a search dataset but enterprising researchers were able to correlate data searched for with other information and actually identify real-world individuals. Like, down to their home address, just from what they typed into the AOL search box.\nStack Overflow obviously has less private information and less potentially invasive results if voting data were to be exposed, but if the online site keeps voting data private then the data dump should respect that privacy too.\nIf the millisecond-resolution vote timestamp were included in the dump, I believe the up/down voting patterns could strongly correlate with other activity on the site (questions, answers, comments). The more history available in the dump, the stronger the correlation can be. People use Stack Overflow during certain times of the day and not others, and the usage pattern will be distinct for each individual. There might be enough pattern information in there to identify who cast a given vote or votes.\nI'm not completely certain that one could get useful information out of timestamp correlation in this way, but I think there's enough of a risk that I suggested truncating the timestamps. If somebody can present a convincing argument that there wouldn't be a way to discover user voting patterns, then the data dump can always be changed for future runs.

The job is simply to enforce the terms and conditions of the site and some maintenance/tidying up. \nAlthough Stack Overflow is meant to be community driven I am not sure on the idea on them worrying about community approval. Sometimes, not often though, it may be their job to be unpopular (say, closing a popular but wildly off-topic question). \n\nUltimately I see little to gain in moderator elections. If any moderator is bad/abuses their position then I imagine they would be kicked out by the SO Team anyway!. \nI think regular elections for new moderators is fine, but I don't see why existing ones should be up for re-election and maybe booted out. \nFinally you should consider that generally elections are useful in deciding the direction of the community.

They make the post easier to edit and maintain by a wider group of users, but they do not contribute to any user's reputation.\nSome of the key features are:\n\nA much lower reputation (100 instead of 2000) is needed to freely edit a community wiki post originally made by someone else. 1\nVoting on a community wiki post does not affect the author's reputation, and downvoting a community wiki answer will not deduct 1 reputation from the voter.\nAccepting an answer marked as community wiki does not affect its original author's reputation, and does not give +2 to the question author.\nBounties awarded to answer marked as community wiki still give reputation to the original author.\nEdits suggested by users with less than 100 reputation will still provide +2 reputation to the editor when approved.\nThe original author still gets badges based on community posts.\nThe original author keeps the reputation gained (or lost) before their post entered community mode.\nThe original author still receives notifications for substantial edits, suggested edits, and comments on the post.\nThe user listed in the author box need not be the original author. Rather, it is the user with the highest percentage of authorship in the final revision, determined by the number of lines inserted or deleted, with a bonus (factor of 2) for the original author. Note that the name shown is calculated upon each edit and cached, so if the user later changes their display name, their previous name will still be displayed until the post is edited again.\n\nHow does a post become a Community Wiki post?\nThere are only three ways that a post becomes community wiki.\n\nThe answer's (not question's) author checks the community wiki checkbox when composing or editing the answer. Note that this checkbox isn't available to users with less than 10 reputation. The checkbox also is not available if the question being answered is already a community wiki. 2\n\nIf you post an answer to a community wiki question, your answer will also be community wiki.\n\nA moderator has reason to believe that the question or answer serves better in community wiki mode - if you believe your post should be converted to a community wiki, you may flag it for moderator attention.\n\n\nIn the past, questions could be made community wiki by their authors or by certain automatic triggers but now the only means is by a moderator converting it to community wiki. When a moderator converts a question to community wiki, all existing answers will also be converted in addition to converting future answers.3\nHow can the Community Wiki status be removed from a post?\nCommunity Wiki status can only be removed by a moderator.\nIf community wiki status is removed from a post, reputation is automatically recalculated as if the post was never a wiki.\nHow can I find Community Wiki posts?\nTo search for Community Wiki posts, type wiki:1, wiki:yes, or wiki:true into the search box. See How do I search? for more information.\nMiscellaneous\n\nRollbacks cannot remove community wiki status.\n\nThe Community User4 might appear as the last editor of a post, even a non-wiki post. This happens either 1. when an edit by an anonymous user is approved, or 2. when it randomly pokes old unanswered questions so they get some attention. In the latter case, this will only be shown in certain overviews and on a notice on the question, and not an actual revision in the revision history.\n\nIf you are looking for an example community wiki post, see this question and this answer. They are all community wikis. You can easily identify community wikis by the text \"community wiki\" where the author's profile picture should be.\n\n\n\n1 The original author of a community wiki post can always edit it, even if they have <100 reputation. Other edits made by users with less than 100 reputation must be reviewed in the usual way before being applied.\n2 Since October 2010, there is no community wiki checkbox when asking a question.\n3 In the past, converting a question to community wiki would not automatically convert the answers, so you may see non-Community Wiki answers to older Community Wiki questions. Additionally, if a non-Community Wiki question is merged into a Community Wiki question, the imported answers will not be automatically converted. If you would like to edit them, you can flag for a moderator to add Community Wiki status to the answer. (Newer answers to these older questions will automatically be Community Wiki.)\n4 See Who is the Community User?, or read the Community User\u2019s profile.\n", "Can we enable syntax highlighting for code in comments?": "\nAt least, I would want bold and italic to work.\nAs for syntax highlighting, you don't get that for simple inlined code sections, so why would you need it in comments.\n", "To give each edit own version history": "\nI think that this behavior is a byproduct of counting all edits in a five-minute window as one edit. This feature was created because there was a common pattern of quickly answering a question with two or three sentenced and maybe a link. Then the user would immediately edit their answer with more detail, and also correct typos and other errors.\nThe problem comes when you factor in the fact that a post rolls over to Community Wiki after 5(?) edits from the original author. Since it's very easy to make these 5 edits in the initial period of 'forming' the post, people wanted a way to retain ownership and reputation from these posts. The solution has been collapsing all edits within a 5-minute window into 1 edit.\nIf it's possible to retain the multiple-edits-count-as-one feature and still have a revision entry for each edit, then I support this feature request.\n", "Do you clean up (delete) your old, unvoted answers? Is doing so encouraged?": "\nYes - I do this. It's one of the reasons I've asked for the ability to see separate up and down votes so I can see those answers that truly have no votes. If an answer has equal numbers of up and down votes (usually 1!) I'd like the chance to be able to correct the answer.\nI also only delete where my answer is just one of several that say the same thing.

Attaching rep to the score of the question rather than the individual votes would also mean the overall view was important, and up and downvotes were commutative: +5 and -5 would give you 0 rep rather than 40 as it does now.\n", "Include meta in search results and related questions?": "\nNaw, let's not do that.\nIf we show meta search results in with SO search results, folks will just stay on SO for their meta-SO tasks, including asking more meta-SO questions on SO proper.

Every few minutes, there's a percentage chance for a certain specific badge's query to run and award all users who qualify for it. The percentage chance is unique per badge and depends on how expensive the badge's query is to run. Under some rare cases, due to random chance, it may be possible that a certain badge's query may not run for many hours, but the majority of the time, the badge query runs at least once every hour, and in 99.9% of cases, it runs at least once every 24 hours.\nBadges that check for number of days (e.g. Refiner, Inquisitive, Epic, etc.) are usually awarded once per day, to ensure that users don't earn the badges if they meet the criteria early in the day but cease to meet them by the time the day is over.\nGeneral rule: Wait at least 24 hours. If you haven't gotten it by then, you probably didn't meet the criteria for the badge, or you initially met them but ceased to meet them by the time the job ran. Try checking the list of all badges and their exact criteria. If you still didn't get awarded a badge after 24 hours and you've confirmed that you still continue to meet its criteria, go ahead and file a report, as at that point, chances are that the badge query is at fault, but it may also be that the badge query simply didn't run due to unlucky random chance (see above).\nTag badges\nThe tag-based badges are calculated on a daily basis at 03:00 UTC, which is when all the tag scores get updated. At that time, any new badges you may have earned will also be awarded, and any badges for which you no longer meet the criteria will be revoked.\nAgain, if you do not receive the badge at that time, you probably don't meet the criteria, or ceased to meet them by the time the script ran.

OpenID requires very long URLs and proxies / firewalls with aggressive settings will sometimes block OpenID accidentally. This has been documented a bunch of times, often in corporate settings. If so, try without the proxy/firewall -- or convince your network admins that OpenID is in fact safe to allow..\n\nHave you modified the default cookie policy in your browser? OpenID, and our login process, requires cookies to be enabled and match the default settings that browsers ship with. If you have modified the cookie policy in your browser (or even worse, have disabled cookies altogether) this can prevent logins from working.\n\nHave you tried clearing your domain cookies? Sometimes the cookie information gets corrupted somehow (not quite sure what happens here) but clearing cookies for the domain in question (serverfault.com, superuser.com, stackoverflow.com) has been known to work.\n\nHave you tried in a different browser? The world is lousy with great browsers, and switching out browsers can quickly tell you if there's something \"wonky\" with your browser plugins, configuration, etc.\n\nAre you able to log in to other sites that support OpenID? Lots of sites now support OpenID including big ones like Facebook. Does your OpenID work there?\n\nDoes your OpenID profile have invalid information in it? This is quite rare, but we have seen instances where profiles with problematic info (like invalid / gibberish email addresses) cause exceptions on our end. If possible, try a new, default OpenID or switch OpenID providers just for testing.\n\nIs your site especially slow to respond? In order to prevent denial of service attacks, it's common for OpenID libraries to have cutoff times of a few seconds when making HTTP requests. If you're delegating, try putting your delegation on a blank, plain vanilla HTML \"hello world\" page to remove any processing delays.\n\nDo you use a self-signed SSL certificate? Because self-signed SSL certificates, if generally accepted, would allow DNS poisoning or other network attacks to enable identity spoofing, we do not support them.\n\nIs your HTML valid? If you are OpenID delegation, something as simple as a missing opening <head> tag will cause an OpenID login failure but you won't necessarily know it from viewing your site in a modern browser. Check your HTML for validity.\n\n\nCheck your OpenID\nThere's also a diagnostic page which might give you more information about any potential problems:\nhttp://test-id.org/OP/Sreg.aspx\nAfter using the above page, check the \"recent logs\" link to see what is going wrong.\nBonus Round\nDon't wait until after something goes wrong to set up an alternate OpenID in your profile.\n", "What HTML tags are allowed on Stack Exchange sites?": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocked.

If you are offended by a user, suck it up and deal with it, or if you find it truly abusive, alert the proper authorities. Taking action into your own hands to go and downvote everything you find is not acceptable at all. By downvoting an item, you are giving a subtle clue to future viewers of the answer that it is not correct (when in fact it may be) and you will be providing a disservice to more than just the person you are attacking.\nFurther Edit If you are the recipient of a case of serial downvoting, take your problem up with the team by mailing team@stackoverflow.com.

The problem is that any \"fix\" to that is likely to harm the system too. For example, suppose someone does create an answer just by grabbing all the best bits of other answers. That's improving the site by collecting all the information together. In an ideal world, the other posters would then delete their original answers, leaving one definitive answer. That's good for the site, but bad for individuals in terms of \"unfair\" rep and badges.\nBasically there's a tension between what's good (and fair) for an individual and what's good for the site as a resource.

It uses highlight.js, and may not necessarily be using the latest release of that library. Therefore, any bugs and feature requests regarding syntax highlighting cannot be handled by Stack Exchange.\nWhy isn't my code being highlighted correctly?\n1. Check that the site you're using has syntax highlighting enabled\nThe full list is available on Meta. If syntax highlighting is not enabled on a site, follow the instructions at the bottom of the answer there.\n2. Make sure you're specifying a language code or the tag exists on a site\nIn case of a tag name make sure to also specify it in lower case. See How do I use syntax highlighting? section below for more info.\n2a. Check that the language is supported on Stack Exchange\nSee Language codes currently available on Stack Exchange section below. If your language is not on the list, follow the instructions in How do I report a bug or request a new language? section below.\n2b. Check that the tag has a language code associated with it\nEach tag may have a highlighting language specified in its properties. Visit the tag's wiki page to see it: click on the tag you've found at step 2 (such as javascript), then click \"Learn more...\". The language code that is currently being used for the tag (if any) will be displayed at the very bottom, below the wiki buttons:\n\n\n\nIf the tag doesn't have a highlighting language specified when it should, create a feature-request on your site's per-site meta to request it. (Only moderators can change the highlighting language for a tag.)\n3. Check that the tags on a question have an associated language codes\nBy default, Stack Exchange uses the tags on a question to determine the language you are using. If there's more than one tag that has a highlighting language specified, it lets highlight.js infer what's the best language to use. If none of the tags have one, no syntax highlighting will be performed. The same highlighting language that is used on a question is also used on its answers.\nHow do I report a bug or request a new language?\nReporting a bug or requesting a feature for a language supported on Stack Exchange\nGo to the list of existing issues in highlight.js GitHub repository and check to see if your request is already filed there, and if not, post it there.\nIf your bug fix or feature request has already been fixed or implemented by highlight.js but isn't working here, please wait, as new versions of highlight.js are deployed on the sites on a scheduled basis, and the latest version hasn't been deployed yet. (If it hasn't been deployed after a long time, you can post a feature request here on Meta asking that Stack Exchange update to the latest version.)\nKeep in mind that Stack Exchange does not maintain this syntax highlighter (aside from installing newer versions of it), and posting bug reports or feature requests concerning it here on Meta will not get them fixed or implemented.\nBefore you do anything, make sure that you've got the correct highlighting turned on.\nRequesting that Stack Exchange support a new language which is already supported by highlight.js\nIf a language is already on the list of languages supported by highlight.js, but is not supported on Stack Exchange (see Language codes currently available on Stack Exchange below), you can raise a feature request here on Meta to ask for it to be deployed on the network.\nWhile it's fine to request for the SE team to add additional supported languages, these requests are extremely likely to be considered low-priority and as such deferred. The current response for such feature requests is that the team finds that the added trade-offs from supporting more languages outweigh their potential benefit, though they're looking for future ways to lighten it.\nRequesting that a new language which is not currently supported by highlight.js be added\nFollow the instructions in Reporting a bug or requesting a feature for a language supported on Stack Exchange above to request that highlight.js support your new language. Once the language is supported by highlight.js, follow Requesting that Stack Exchange support a new language which is already supported by highlight.js to make it available here on Stack Exchange.\nHow do I use syntax highlighting?\nAs long as all the conditions in the Why isn't my code being highlighted correctly? section above are satisfied, highlighting of code blocks will kick in automatically based on the question's tags. (See 3. Check that the tags on a question have an associated language codes section above for how this works.) Inline code is not highlighted.\nIt is possible to explicitly override the default highlighting language in use on the post with your language of choice for a specific code block, by specifying a language hint above the code block. Note that this is only supported when using the code fence (```) method of code formatting; since the implementation of CommonMark, doing so on code blocks using the four-space indent method is no longer supported*:\n```lang-or-tag-here\ncode goes here\n```\n\nYou may use either a language code or a tag name in a language hint to activate syntax highlighting. See below for the complete list of language codes supported on Stack Exchange.\nFor example:\n\nHere is a code block with language code (having the \"lang-\" prefix) as a hint:\n```lang-js\nfunction greet(person) {\n    return \"Hello \" + person;\n}\nvar user = \"Jon Skeet\";\nalert(greet(user));\n```\n\nRenders as:\nfunction greet(person) {\n    return \"Hello \" + person;\n}\nvar user = \"Jon Skeet\";\nalert(greet(user));\n\n\nHere is a code block with tag name (without \"lang-\" prefix) as a hint:\n```typescript\nvar arr = [0, 1, 2];  // will highlight if [typescript] tag exists\n```\n\nHere on Meta Stack Exchange, this renders as:\nvar arr = [0, 1, 2];  // will highlight if [typescript] tag exists\n\n\nIf you don't want to have any syntax highlighting, you can use the lang-none language code:\n```lang-none\n[code here]\n```\n\nRenders as:\n[code here]\n\n\n\nYou can also apply a language hint to all code blocks in your post, so you don't have to add a hint before each one, by adding an HTML comment at the top of your post. The hint will then be applied to all code blocks within your post, including those which use four-space indent or HTML <pre><code>:\n<!-- language-all: lang-or-tag-here -->\n\nNote that when used on a question, it does not override the highlighting language on its answers; those will still be highlighted by default as per the question's tags.\n\nLanguage codes currently available on Stack Exchange\nThis is a complete list of every identifier that you can use in a language hint for syntax highlighting.

Keep in mind that by default all tags start off with null as their language hint!\nYou can also use the plain none keyword to manually specify no syntax highlighting, similar to using the lang-none code above.\n\n* The former method of specifying a highlighting language can still be used for HTML code blocks: place an HTML comment <!-- language: lang-or-tag-here --> before the <pre><code> tags and it will work. This:\n<!-- language: c -->\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h>\nint main() {\n  printf(\"Hello World\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nwill render as\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n  printf(\"Hello World\");\n}\n\nAlso, this former method hasn't been completely removed for four-space indented code blocks, but merely deprecated. While it will still work for the time being on four-space indented code blocks, it may/will be removed in the future.\n\n\nNote to editors:\nPlease do not edit the above list manually.\n\nJust because you type something in and it looks like it's highlighted correctly does not mean the identifier actually exists in the system. Keep in mind that invalid identifiers trigger an automatic language detection.\nNot all the languages supported by highlight.js are available everywhere. The set of languages available depends on how the library is built or included.\nAdditionally, several languages that are indicated as supported in highlight.js's documentation may also not be supported by Stack Exchange version of highlight.js, as they are in separate modules which may not be deployed on Stack Exchange.\n\nBecause of these points, to update the list please use the script it was generated with and link to this script (or another Meta post which confirms an identifier's existence) in your edit summary.\nNote to commenters:\nThe comments on this FAQ are for requesting clarification of something you might not understand in the FAQ so that it can be fixed.

Like at 190 rep upvote then accept answer yields a different result to accept answer then upvote. Personally I think it should be fixed because it looks bad and looks like a bug (and imho is a bug).\nAs for Jon's point about the devs having enough to do, frankly I think the solution to this is trivial. Just put rep in two buckets:\n\nSoft cap: upvotes (+10) and downvotes (-2) received, limited to 200 per day;\nHard cap: downvotes given (-1), answer accepted (+2 given, +15 received), bounties (variable).\n\nAnd then the system is completely consistent.\n", "Create RSS feeds on a set of tags": "\nTo subscribe to a single feed for multiple tags, use \"or\" in the URL.

My usual concern is the added complexity of things like adding bounties to other people's questions and who chooses the answer or potential hijacking issues.\nBut this proposal is far more limited and thus far less complicated. You should probably limit it by saying you can't top up a bounty within, say, 2 days of it expiring and point out that the winner is still selected by the OP. Other than that, I see no real problem with this.\nOne issue worth discussing however is should this extend the deadline for the bounty?  I'm thinking not but maybe there is an argument for doing so.\n", "Polarity of conflict between upvotes and downvotes?": "\nActually, the vast majority of people upvote a lot more than they downvote. There are really two reasons for this. First, people like rewarding good behavior much more than they like punishing bad behavior.

Though StackOverflow and ServerFault stricly require the question/answer model, the rules have been relaxed here.

At some point I might even make the post worse that it was before or twist the sense away from what the originator intended. This would be a bad thing.\nEditing with no thought of reward is probably the best approach. It means you edit because you think the post needs improving. If the OP disagrees they can always roll back.\nNOTE: This was written before they opened up editing to all and sundry giving a +2 to accepted edits. I'm all for this.\n", "Why do you cast downvotes on answers?": "\nIf I see a bad answer at 0 votes, I generally leave a comment to give the poster a chance to correct or delete it (since the first downvote has been known to trigger a flood of pile-on downvotes). If I check back later and find that it is still wrong and not deleted, I will then downvote.\nIf a bad answer has already been voted up into, say, the top two or three answers, I will both comment and downvote. I don't want bad answers to be above good answers.\nAs for what I mean by a bad answer, I would say #1 and (on rare occasions) #6; however, in practice these kind of answers rarely stay around long enough for me to downvote (thus the 27 downvotes in my profile).\nFor #2, #3, #4, and #5, I'll simply leave a comment. For #8, I'll flag the answer; that already knocks the answer down a notch and potentially leads to -100 reputation for the answerer, so I see no need to penalize both the answer and myself by downvoting also.\n", "Are there any statistics kept on RSS feeds?": "\nThere's no way to reliably determine this..

That's certainly been the standard advice on newsgroups etc for years. It doesn't always work, of course: if a dedicated group of trolls \"attacks\" a newsgroup, reducing the signal to noise ratio below any useful level, it can sometimes effectively spell the end of that newsgroup. Fortunately I see no sign of that happening on SO - yet. As the site gathers momentum, it will become more of a target, of course.

This is because you lean heavily on the tags to index your content for search. It's why flickr and youtube let you tag things any way you want.  \nBut when talking about text, which is already easily indexed, the tags themselves don't matter for indexing; you index the text directly. The tags don't matter for summarizing; that's the job of the title. Instead, tags are used strictly for categorization. Categorization is a different thing entirely, and it only works if everyone is sorting content into the same set of categories. You need a rigid set of categories for this happen. It's why gmail labels (which are really tags) are harder to just create willy-nilly.  \nStackOverflow content is definitely text-based, and that means we should be thinking of rigid tag categories rather than a loose tag cloud.  I've advocated a few changes to the tagging system to help improve things:\n\ndone Minimum rep threshold required to create new tags (implemented at 100, I'd like to see it bumped to 250 so that an eager new user has to spend at least more than one day with the site before they can create new tags).\ndone A better explanation of why the question was rejected would be nice, too.\nAdd a warning whenever using a tag that appears on fewer than 10 other questions.\nRestrict certain junk words like 'and', 'the', 'a', 'server'(on stackoverflow), 'visual', etc from use as tags entirely.  Possibly even do this silently where possible- the tag just doesn't show after you post.\nSome synonyms are already tracked and corrected automatically every hour.  This should be done as questions are posted and edited instead.  This way,  users are more likely to notice the tag changed (often the entire question is resolved before the correction, so the user never knows about it) and we reduce time spent by community members correcting these tags that could be more profitably spent elsewhere.  This is also important because by the time a correction is applied the question has fallen off the main page, and users that might have been interested in the question based on the corrected tag will never see it.\ndone A way for users to nominate tags for merging/elimination/add to synonyms list built into the user interface of the site (not just posting a question here) that allows high-rep users to comment and vote on the nominations via the 10K tools.\nRe-name 'tags' to 'labels' ala GMail, to encourage users to think of them in terms of categorization.\n\n", "Could we make tags imply other tags?": "\nThat almost sounds like an automated method of what I have been doing for a while now when it comes to tagging. I will generally tag something in it's broad category (example sqlserver) and then use the other tags to whittle down the specificity (sqlserver2000, sqlserver2005, sqlserver2008). This would allow for someone to subscribe to the broad tag sqlserver and still see my problem which is specific to sqlserver2005.\nYour example of C# and .NET I think showcases a lot of examples of people tagging wrong. If their problem is specific to the C# language I believe it should be C# and you shoudln't have to include .NET at all. If your question is a confusion in the actual .NET framework itself (and therefore not generally C# specific, or VB, etc.) The C# tag isn't exactly necessary.\nAgain, this is generally I how I view it. \nOne question I have would be, does this automatic linkage mean that the tags will automatically display that are linked, and if so, would this take away one of your five allowed tags?\n", "What makes a SOpedian's profile worth visiting? (Data dump analysis)": "\nYou can't really trust profile views as a metric of popularity. I know personally that early on I fell into the habit of clicking on my own profile to view my upvotes/downvotes, etc. (this was before the \"little envelope\" functionality was added). I still tend to click on my profile instead of the envelope, thus potentially inflating my profile views.\nIn short, profile views may be a measure of popularity for some, and narcissism for others. =)\nEDIT: You also can't underestimate the \"train-wreck\" profiles: users who give utterly horrible answers, or routinely ask terrible questions. They probably get more views just out of morbid curiosity.\n", "Accept Multiple Answers or Split Bounty among Several Users": "\nThe goal isn't to have multiple answers each containing a piece of the puzzle. It's to have a single, correct, comprehensive answer. Bounty provides a means of encouraging answers to tough problems by offering a reward: allowing you to subdivide this reward creates a situation where you're misleading those participating (who think they're competing for a big prize but only receive a portion of it) and potentially discouraging users from taking the time to write a complete answer.\nIn short, I think it's a terrible idea. Good, useful answers will be rewarded, by the voters who find them good and useful.

For example, I'm about to rename a bunch of tags on Server Fault which are in the form\n\n[windowsserver2008]\n\nI do not believe anyone types \"windowsserver2008\" into Google (or Bing, or whatever). I believe they type\n\nWindows Server 2008\n\nWhich means the appropriate tag is \n\n[windows-server-2008]\n\n.. because dashes are treated as word breaks in every known search engine (and regular expressions, since forever).

It's been my practice to review an item with flags, and if it's a clear-cut case, I'll act or not act on it, and then clear it.  If it's a judgement call, I'll leave the flags, and see if it accumulates more or another moderator sees it as actionable.  (This is pretty unorganized/variable in my opinion, but I work with what I'm given/told, and it hasn't seemed to be a problem here)\nAlso, the number of items flagged for a mod appear in a red box with a # in the header, so we see those immediately.  So items flagged for a mod are instantly visible to us - so if there's anything crazy-bad, like a porn in an answer, flag it, rather than marking it offensive.
