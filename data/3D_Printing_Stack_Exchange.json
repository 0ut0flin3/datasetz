{"speed - How to obtain high resolution prints in a shorter period of time?": "\nYou could experiment with slicing. For example, you might not need high resolution all over the object, but you can speed up some straight parts by using greater layer high there. See a part of Slic3r manual about such thing.\nIt is also possible to print thicker infill every Nth layer, see Infill optimization in Slic3r.\nOther slicers might have those features as well.\n", "print material - Is 3D printing safe for your health?": "\nThere is very little information about safety available, as home 3D printers are relatively new. However, plastics such as ABS have a long history in making plastic products, and a study found that at traditional manufacturing methods (such as injection molding and hot wire cutting) do not release dangerous levels of carcinogens and/or respiratory sensitizers in to the air.\nOf course, 3D printers are not among the processes covered in the study. In home 3D printing circles, this study that looks at ultrafine particle (UFP) emissions, is often cited. It finds that printing ABS releases relatively high levels of UFP's and PLA releases significantly fewer (but still quite a large amount). However, it is unclear whether/how dangerous these UFP's are in the amounts emitted.\nIt is often suggested that PLA, partly because of the reduced UFP emissions is safer to print than ABS, partly because of its \"natural\" origins as it can be derived from materials such as cornstarch. I would caution against this line of reasoning since \"natural\" materials can still be poisonous (snake venom is natural, after all) and the cornstarch is heavily processed so it hardly resembles its original form. The lower UFP emissions may suggest it is safer, but the study is only quantitative, not qualitative.\nThat said, PLA does probably pose less of a risk (despite my earlier argumentation against \"natural\" materials, PLA does play quite nicely with the human body), but I contend the risk with ABS is not too large anyways, given that it has been safely used in factories for decades.\nAnother study is often miscited, supposedly saying that 3D printing ABS releases hydrogen cyanide. The study only looks at the thermal decomposition of ABS, which happens at significantly higher temperatures than are reached during printing (but a significantly malfunctioning printer might cause toxic gasses to be released, but I contend that at that point you should worry about your printer being on fire, rather than temporary exposure to some toxins).\nThere are no printers out there that are fundamentally safer than others. However, some printers have an enclosure (containing the fumes) and some even have a carbon filter and a fan for fume extraction. If you would like to err on the side of caution, this might be a good choice (but again, it is not clear if a carbon filter is totally effective).\nFinally, as printers are generally quite noisy it tends to be preferrable to keep your printer in a separate room from where you usually work. In this case, fume exposure (during the few minutes that you go to check on your print) is minimal, and the potential advantages of a \"safer\" printers or using \"safer\" materials diminish.\nIncidental exposure as a hobbyist is probably not a big deal; workers in factories are exposed to the fumes of melted plastic their entire lives and they don't seem to be dropping dead. On the other hand, if you are going to be printing structurally then it is probably preferable to move your printer to a separate room, if not because of health and safety because of the noise.\n", "quality - How important is the minimum layer height on a 3d printer?": "\nI believe the Slic3r Manual summarizes this quite nicely:\n\nA thicker layer height will provide more flow, and consequently more heat, making the extrusion adhere to the bed more. It also gives the benefit of giving more tolerance for the levelness of the bed. It is recommended to raise the first layer height to match the diameter of the nozzle, e.g. a first layer height of 0.35mm for a 0.35mm nozzle.\n\nIn other words, larger layer heights for the first layer typically gives better adhesion, and makes inaccurate bed leveling (and auto leveling) still work.\n", "fdm - Are there any metals that exhibit a large glass state?": "\nA few things are required for effective extrusion-style 3d printing materials:\n\nIt must stay where placed by the nozzle long enough to harden (or, alternately for pastes and such, have a shear-thinning or thixotropic viscous profile so it will not flow under its own weight). \nIf using a filament extruder, it must have a wide range of viscosity that varies gradually over a considerable temperature range. This is necessary to develop the proper \"cap zone\" semi-melt shearing behavior that allows the incoming filament to act like a piston and generate pressure upstream of the nozzle. Pellet extruders have a similar requirement but related to screw/wall shearing rather than filament/wall shearing. If using neither filament nor pellets, such as clay printers, the material must be pumpable by a positive-displacement pump. (It is possible to pump molten metal, but the cost is quite high.)\nIt must form some kind of bond with previously-deposited solid material, without needing to be in a state that will rapidly flow and lose shape.\nIt must have some combination of low shrinkage, the ability to creep at the printer's ambient temp, and/or low stiffness that allows consecutive layers to be stacked without an unacceptable amount of warping. \n\nLiquid metals tend to have a conflict between \"Staying where you put it\" and \"bonding with the previous layer.\" In order for deposited metal to fully bond, the interface material needs to reach the melting point so a true fusion weld occurs. And in order to supply enough heat to remelt the interface without an additional heat source like an arc, the deposited molten metal needs to be very hot. So it will tend to run while it cools. High density and high heat capacity makes it run fast and cool slowly. \nPretty much every DIY metal 3d print (such as made by wire-feed MIG welders) ends up looking something like this:\n\nhttps://3dprint.com/29944/diy-metal-printing-garage/\nIn comparison, polymers have long molecular chains that allow them to \"diffusion weld\" and adhere WITHOUT fully remelting the interface. Molten liquid plastic will stick to solid plastic quite effectively. The interface only needs to get hot enough for appreciable diffusion to intertwine the molecular chains. This will occur between the glass point and melting point, without true fusion occurring. So you can print molten plastic at a temperature where it will stay in place long enough to harden, and still get good bonding.\nMetals also tend to be very stiff, which encourages warping. It is difficult to build a heated environment of sufficient temperature to properly stress-relieve the thermal contraction stress as the print progresses, whereas with plastic a heated build plate and warm enclosure can permit warping stresses to start relaxing as the print progresses. \nIt is possible to \"FDM-style\" 3d print filament/wire made of metal alloys that have a wide range between solidus and liquidus. It has been done using solder and similar alloys. However, between the warping stresses, poor layer bonding from inadequate interface re-melting, and use of soft low-melting alloys, the resulting printed parts will usually end up being weaker than if they had simply been printed in a strong plastic. For example, PEEK is nearly as strong as aluminum, and carbon fiber or fiberglass composite plastics can exceed metals on various performance metrics. So what's the point of printing with weak, brittle metal alloys?\nOver the years, lots of people have tried FDM-style metal printing, but no one has found it worthwhile to pursue in the long run. More typical DIY metal printing approaches like 3D MIG welding following by cleanup machining will produce better results.\n", "filament - How is PLA different from ABS material?": "\nParaphrasing this site. Feel free to add suggestions in the form of comments and I will try to incorporate them.\nSummary\n\nABS: Stronger, machinable, more flexible, and more temperature\nresistant than PLA. Typically printed on a heated bed. Warping is a common problem when printing ABS.\nPLA: Wider range of filaments available, easier and in some cases faster to print. Not as strong as ABS and the fact that its biodegradable could be seen as both a benefit and a drawback.\n\nMaterial Properties:\n\nABS: Strong plastic with mild flexibility. Naturally beige in color. Can be filled and sanded. Higher temperature. Easy to recycle.\nPLA: Not as strong as ABS but more rigid. Naturally transparent. More difficult to fill and sand. Can sag in hot temperatures. Sourced from organic matter so it can be broken down in commercial compost facilities.\n\nPart Accuracy:\n\nABS: Part warping is a significant issue. Sharp corners will often be rounded.\nPLA: Less heat required contributes to less warping. Becomes more liquid at common extruder temperatures so finer details can be printed.\n\nSafety and Handling:\n\nABS: Strong burning/melting plastic smell is present when printing ABS. Health concerns have been raised regarding airborne ultrafine particles generated while printing with ABS (ref). ABS will absorb moisture causing popping when the moisture enters the hot end. This leads to discontinuities in the print job.\nPLA: Doesn't smell as strongly when printing due to its organic nature. Moisture can also be absorbed into PLA and can irreversibly damage it.\n\n", "filament - Multi-color printing with desktop 3D printer?": "\nThe most obvious solution is to pause the print and swap filament for another color.\nAnother option is to splice pieces of filament together, though this does not allow very precise control of when the switch happens. There is also a device that can automatically slice filament this way.\nFinally, another option that uses very little external equipment is to use (permanent) markers to colorize light-colored filament.\nOther options include upgrading to a printer with more hotends, or installing a hotend with multiple filament inputs and one outputs, but these options would involve significantly changing your printer setup.\n", "material - 3D printing for outdoor use: \"What types of filament are most weather resistant?\"": "\nPET(G) is a strong contender. It is very strong and water-resistant, and as such is often used to make pop bottles.\nPLA has a reputation for being \"biodegradable\" and therefore it is often discouraged to use PLA outside and/or in contact with water. However, PLA only biodegrades under very specific conditions which it won't generally be exposed to so it can be used (though, as a harder and less flexible material it is more likely to be damaged by hail).\nABS and Nylon are good choices as well. Basically, any plastic you have on hand will last for years, even in an outside application.\n", "filament - How do I give 3D-printed parts in PLA a shiny smooth finish?": "\nPLA parts can be finished with a coat of epoxy like XTC-3D from Smooth-On. This will smooth out the part and give it a pretty nice shine.\nI've also had a fair amount of success sanding prints, giving them a coat of automotive filler primer, and using glossy spray paint.\nYou can also get great results with an acetone vapor finish if you're willing to switch to ABS. Though that will require a heated bed and can be a bit more finicky to work with than PLA.\n", "quality - Resolution Drawbacks": "\nThe biggest effect I've see on resolution is due to plastic stress due to thermal gradients.\nThe higher resolution prints build up more layers of material, and each layer has a cumulative effect on thermal stress.  The upper layers pulling up more as they cool, and the lower layers curling up more strongly as the layer count is increased.\nTo counteract this, a heated (or even just a draft free) enclosure makes a big difference.  Having a heated print bed helps significantly, as long as the bed itself resists deformation (a sheet metal or PCB bed will bend more than glass under the same tension, for instance).\nThe actual plastic strength, however, appears increased.  Laying down thinner layers of material appears to increase the bond strength between layers.\n", "filament - How to print metal-like parts?": "\nIf you'd like to print on RepRap like FDM printers, you cannot print from metal, but you can use some filament that tries to look like metal. I have good experience with Bronzefill, but there are plenty of others, just Google for metal filament 3d printing. Note that sometimes the parts need to be post-processed with a rock tumbler. There are several open source DIY tumblers you can build and use.\nIf you actually want to print from metal, you would need SLS (Selective laser sintering) printer, which is much more expensive.\n", "post processing - Are there any ways to make a 3D print transparent?": "\nIt depends on a lot of factors, type of plastic, whether the parts need to be strong, can you use a vase print, etc.  Here's a few thoughts.\nPLA - The brand of PLA makes a big difference, some can be printed very clear, some can't.  Most of the transparent PLAs I've used print much more clear at around 240\u00b0C.\nABS - I've seen some pretty impressive clear parts printed as a single layer shell in ABS and then vapor smoothed. I tend to find ABS more translucent and less transparent though.\nPETG - Again the specific PETG you use matters, but I haven't seen nearly as much variation as with PLA.  I'm not sure how much temperature matters, but if it's too hot you get bubbles which will decrease clarity.\nThin Wall Prints - I don't have much experience here, but the Smooth On XTC-3D or vapor smoothing seem to be effective.\nSolid Prints\nIf I want transparency, I usually print it at 100% infill (should be a real 100%, too much overextrusion or underextrusion will decrease transparency).  Printing slower and with less cooling sometimes helps.  It's easier to get the infill solid with a direct drive extruder, I couldn't get decent results with a long bowden tube (a short bowden tube works fine).\nHere's a page where I tested 10 transparent filaments, the printed samples are 2mm thick, 100% infill - http://thrinter.com/10-transparent-filaments.  Those samples are all overextruded a bit, you can get better results if you dial in the extrusion precisely, but that's hard to get right, and the optimal settings may change slightly depending on the part geometry.  Larger nozzles and thicker layers may help to, but I haven't experimented much with that as there are significant downsides to that approach.\n", "post processing - How to easily get rid of rafts and support structures?": "\nThe best way to get rid of them is to change the design of the printed object to make them unnecessary.\nInstead of printing the one part with support material, the piece can be split into two or more parts which can be printed without support material and assembled after the printing.\n\nGiven that this is not always fully possible, a convenient way to get rid of additional structures is to use a different fillament for them that can be removed easily. This list of printing materials includes Polyvinyl Acetate (PVA), which is water soluble. You can wash the support material away given that your actual printign material is not water soluble. Here's a quote from the website (emphasize mine):\n\nPVA (Polyvinyl Acetate) filament prints translucent with a slightly yellow tint and is primarily used as a 3D printing support material because it is water-soluble, meaning that it will dissolve when exposed to water (and so MUST be kept dry prior to use). PVA is most often used with 3D printers capable of dual extrusion: one extruder printing a primary material (such as ABS or PLA) and the other printing this dissolvable filament to provide support for overhanging features. PVA 3D printer filament is available in 1.75mm and 3mm.\n\n", "What are main differences between rafts, skirts and brims?": "\nRafts:\nRafts are a few layers of plastic a placed on the printing surface before the object is printed.  If non water dissoluble filament is used, a bit of an air gap will be placed between the raft and the print itself so it can be removed easily. A raft can help a print stick to the printing surface as it normally has a larger surface area than the bottom of the print.  It also allows the bottom layers of the print to contact another layer of plastic so there is less spreading compared to printing on the printing bed itself.\n\nSkirts:\nSkirts are loops of plastic that are extruded around the object that is being printed.  On the first layer this allows the filament to get pushed through the extruder so that a steady flow can be established.  A multiple layer skirt can be used to create a blockage around the print so there is less air movement on the print and the print can cool slower.\n\nBrims:\nA brim is a layer of plastic that is placed on the first layer of the print go allow for better adhesion to the printing surface.  It does not extend under the print as a raft does, but only goes from the edge of the print to a set distance away.  \n\nCredits: Images from Slic3r\n", "reprap - Is the weather a problem for MDF frames?": "\nGenerally speaking, MDF will weather OK. In areas of high humidity you might experience warpage, but you can mitigate that by sealing the surface with paint or varnish.  However you will probably find that of the two materials, acrylic will be more stable over a few years.\n", "cost - How to 3D print a bike?": "\nYou will need a laser sintering or lasercusing printer, which will not be something you can buy for home use. They are horribly expensive.\nYou could always print this in PLA or ABS and cast it in aluminium. Then you have to find a safe method to test the result, because casting is not quite as simple as it looks and the bike could be seriously dangerous.\n", "reprap - How many times printed printer can print it-self?": "\nThe files used to print these objects are digital, and do not degrade in any way after each printing. There are no side effects or degradation that occurs over time due simply to printing them multiple times.\nThis is the RepRap philosophy, and the machines are actually designed with enough tolerance for printing and building mistakes that even if the print isn't perfect, it will not only work fine, but it can print a printer better than it was printed, with some care and attention to calibration.\nThe process still takes a lot of human intervention, in the way of building the new printer and properly calibrating it.  If there are errors in the printer or the prints it produces, they can almost always be attributed to the builder/calibrator/user, and not to the design or the fact it's the Nth generation of printer.\n", "software - Printing Plastic Replacement Parts": "\nThe easiest way is as you currently do: model the pieces by hand, using (digital) calipers to measure them.\nScanning technology isn't very good, and the models are not of printable quality. Usually, fixing a scan is more work than modeling an item from scratch.\n", "Conversion of 3 mm ABS filament to 1.75 mm": "\nIn theory, making filament is easy.  You take a 3\u00a0mm hotend with a 1.75\u00a0mm hole, and extrude the 3\u00a0mm (sometimes actually 2.85\u00a0mm) filament, let it cool, and then reel it up.\nIn reality there are a lot of pitfalls to making filament - if the pressure isn't even, the hole not perfect, the temperature uneven, you can end up with oval filament, filament with bubbles, or worse.  If you are over temperature you may damage the filament and it could look good, but not melt correctly when used.  If you reel it too fast you may thin it out more than the intended diameter, or too slow and you may thicken it. A lot of hotends use steppers, which may result in ripples in the filament, so you may end up building a nearly custom filament machine.\nResolving all these problems is probably not worth simply selling or giving away the filament to someone that can use it, and buying the right size for your machine.\nIf you are still interested, though, you might as well go all the way and build a full filament extruder that accepts raw plastic feedstock (usually pellets) as well as your filament, and convert it that way, then continue using it to create your own filament.\n", "quality - What are the reasons for my 3D prints having large numbers of strings between parts of a layer?": "\nStringing is often a result of too-high a temperature, or insufficient retraction. When there is highly liquid filament in the nozzle tip, it can adhere to the remainder of the print while dripping as the nozzle moves, leading to a thin string of the filament forming. As further travel moves are performed in each layer, this turns to a web.\nThe high temperature causes filament to be very liquid, causing it to move downward in the nozzle chamber easily, as opposed to having to be extruded forcefully due to viscosity. The temperature setpoint of 210 was high enough to cause this to happen.\nA second possible cause, insufficient retraction, can also be blamed for this issue. Retraction is a process in which the extruder reverses its movement to pull filament back up the hotend, preventing it from dripping at the tip, and forming a string. Most slicers will allow specifying a numeric value in millimeters of filament to be retracted. Remember that printers with Bowden tubes between nozzle/hotend and extruder motor will require increased retraction and priming (extrusion when starting to print after a retract-and-move). Note that too much retraction can cause other problems, such as insufficient plastic in the hotend chamber at the start of the next printing move, which can cause gaps and other issues.\n", "filament - Are there any methods of limiting exposure of hazardous fumes and odors emitted by heating the plastics?": "\nUsing negative pressure ventilation and a suitable organic filter will limit your exposure to toxic compounds, but won't completely remove them from your environment.\nEnclose your printer in as air-tight a box as you can manage, then use a fan to suck air out of the box.  This negative pressure will ensure that any leaks in the box will not allow gasses to escape.\nThe air should be blown through an organic filter.  This might be done with face mask filters for painting, for instance.\nAdditional filtering may be done depending on the compounds you expect the printer to produce, but the ideal situation is to set up a ventilation system to the outdoors where the products cannot concentrate and harm anyone.\nAnother poorer option is to simply wear a proper organic filter mask yourself.  It's not as good, since the compounds can spread through your residence or remain in the air and be inhaled when you aren't printing.\n", "post processing - What is the best way to connect 3D printed parts?": "\nFor ABS print, I recommend acetone. It is not a glue, but it will dissolve the plastic a bit and if you apply it to both connecting parts and push them together, they will stay connected after the acetone dries. However, it does not dry very fast and you have to be careful not to destroy the object.\nFor PLA I usually use regular super glue (Cyanoacrylate).\n", "pla - How to recycle filament material from printed parts?": "\nThere are a few options.\n\nMachines are available which grind the used plastic into fine pieces, melt it down, and extrude it as filament to be reused. Filabot is perhaps the most well known.\nDepending on where you live the local recycling programs may accept PLA or ABS. They will then shred it and melt it down for reuse.\nPLA is bio-degradable so you can put it in the compost.\nI put scrap ABS in acetone which results in a slurry which can be used as a glue to attach ABS parts, fix cracks, and hold parts to the bed.\n\n", "extruder - Why do the corners of my ABS object lift off the bed?": "\nThere are many different approaches to solving this issue and most of the answers already are spot-on. However, the fundamental reason for the \"warping\" is incorrect and inconsistent temperature across the material.\nIf there is too much fluctuation in the temperature across the object in this heated state can result in warping. The reason you see this mostly on the build plate is because the temperature of the first few layers of molten plastic vary much more against the build plate than against higher layers. Note that you can see additional warping mid-print using ABS and this can be a result of a draft or sudden drop in ambient temperature.\nSo, to help solve your problem, here are some suggestions (sorry if there are duplicates):\n\nCompletely enclose/seal your machine's build area to reduce (or eliminate if possible) draft and prevent the natural heat of the machine from escaping.\nIncrease the temperature on your build plate. I almost exclusively use ABS on my printer and I keep my HBP at about 112C. However, I live in the NW of the US, so my climate is naturally cooler than say Florida.\nAlternatively, try decreasing the nozzle temperature to a lower point within the ABS melting range. This will just shorten the gap between the inconsistencies in temperature across layers. It is typically better to print at lower temperatures if you can help it. Obviously there are differences in the filament, so you'll have to find that \"sweet spot\".\nEnsure your build plate is flat and your tape doesn't have bubbles. Your BP being flat should be a no brainer, but if your kapton tape (or whatever you use) has bubbles, your freshly printed plastic may not be getting the same temperature from the BP as the rest of your part. This is a bad thing as mentioned earlier.\nUse extra adhesion techniques such as \"ABS Glue\" (ABS w/ acetone) or even hairspray. This works about 80% of the time for me, but can make it a bit difficult when removing the parts off the BP.\n\n", "When should I use a raft, when should I use a brim?": "\nA raft will allow for better adhesion for the whole print as the raft attaches to the printing surface and the print attaches to the raft. Rafts go all the way under the print and consist of multiple layers, whereas a brim is only 1 layer and on the outside of the print. Rafts are normally harder to remove than brims because of the increased contact with the print.\nFrom my own experiences, the brim does not help a lot with layer adhesion as it is only 1 layer. I normally use a raft when I need a nice looking 1st layer that is not on the bed or when there are not enough contact points.\n", "adhesion - My print is warping: how can I ensure that it cools evenly?": "\nWithout more information we cannot address what is causing your edges to turn up. This can depend on the model being printed, the process, the material, the bed, and the method used to bond it to the bed.\nAs far as the initial question, a fan will most certainly ensure uneven cooling.\nThe middle of the print is, and will remain, the warmest.  If you want the print to cool evenly, you'll need an enclosure to block out drafts and air currents, and you'll need to bring the heated bed temperature and enclosure temperature down slowly over a long period of time.\n", "abs - How can I stop my print bed tape from sticking to the filament?": "\nThis can highly depend on the slicer you are using. Some software such as Makerware and Slic3r allow you to adjust the settings for the first raft/part layers. I might suggest adjusting this \"Z0\" point to about 1/4-1/2 of your layer height. Essentially the first layer (or two) will not adhere as well.\nThis is just one suggestion of many solutions. Here are some other variables I could think of off-hand:\n\nType of build plate tape (ie masking, painters, kapton, etc.)\nType of material. I've noticed that PLA is very stubborn if you let the part completely cool after printing and that it's much easier to remove the part from the build plate/raft right after it's complete.\nType of build plate. Are you applying too much heat (if you have a heated bp) for the material such as PLA?\nTry lowering your layer height. This will ensure that each strand does not have too much surface area and therefore less chance that it will create a vacuum affect with the build plate. This can, however, result in a worse surface finish.\n\n", "abs - Safety precautions when using acetone": "\nThere are a few main safety precautions you should consider.\n\nMake sure the area is well-ventilated. Acetone is flammable. A buildup of acetone gas could quickly get concentrated, meaning that a single spark could lead to disaster. Using a fan is good; angle it towards an open window. This is also to prevent exposure to acetone because of its toxicity.\nBe prepared to fight a fire. Should vapor ignite, you may need to fight the fire. If it is large enough, then you should clearly evacuate the area. If it appears to be small, use dry chemical powder to snuff out the fire. Alcohol foam, water spray, and/or fog may be used on slightly larger fires. Acetone is not likely to cause a large inferno to rip through the building. But there's always the chance of a small fire. Be careful.\nCreate a vapor chamber. This is another way to stop a potential fire from spreading. It can also reduce contamination.\nWear gloves. This can minimize any potential transfer toxic effects. However, skin exposure is unlikely to cause major issues.\n\nAcetone is toxic, as I mentioned before, but it is not highly toxic. Exposure via the eyes and nose/mouth is the main risk. Skin effects may occur (e.g. mild irritation), but they are minor and generally arise only after long-term exposure (hence the recommendation of gloves in some cases).\nAcetone exposure is only a serious problem when a person is repeatedly exposed to levels greater than 1,000 ppm (severe effects only arise at much higher levels). It seems unlikely, given a proper ventilation system, that this will be an issue\nIn addition to all this, basic safety precautions such as wearing a ventilator mask and goggles should definitely be taken. When working with any such chemicals with the potential for bodily harm, these should absolutely be used.\n", "desktop printer - How to automate printing of multiple parts continuously?": "\nThe only thing I can think of off hand is an old mod for the early MakerBot machines. It first was released for the Thing-O'-Matic I believe, but is compatible with Replicator 1 machines (and its knock-offs). Here's the Thingiverse page, but look up Automatic Build Plate.\nEssentially, you can use the Replicator G slicing program and there is a setting for \"ABP\" or Automatic Build Plate. This will basically tell the ABP to run its routine after the controller receives the response that the printing program is done and roll the finished part off the edge of the build plate, then start the same program over again.\nDrawbacks:\n\nI don't think it's easily compatible with newer machines/slicers. But, it's open source\nPretty sure you have to use Replicator G, which is outdated now and may make your machine sound like it's going to fall apart (I know from experience)\n\nGoing off of @Pete's answer about solenoids. It reminded me that someone integrated a solenoid \"ejector\" (aka Boxing Glove) for their machine.\nUpdate (06/08/2016):\nForgot to mention that if you choose to create your own \"Boxing Glove\" or conveyor belt, some software such as Octo-Pi and Repetier-Host allow plugins. So, you could interface with your hardware via customized code and integrate the functionality directly into the slicing application for the full closed loop operation.\n", "pla - Does filament have to be stored in an airtight environment?": "\nIt makes a difference where I live, and I'm not in a particularly humid climate (California).  When printing with wet filament, you'll sometimes hear it popping and see steam coming out of the extruder (it's usually only this extreme with nylon).  With most other filaments, when they're wet, the extruded filament will have small bubbles in it and the surface finish of the parts will be rougher, with breaks in the layer lines.  It can also lead to more oozing and stringing.  Air print a few centimeters of filament and look at it closely to see if there's any bubbles, if not, it's probably dry enough.  Whether the filament absorbs enough water to be noticeable in a few hours, in a day, or in a week depends a lot on the filament (and I assume the humidity too).  I'm mostly noticed problems with nylon, ABS, and NinjaFlex, less with PLA and PETG (though I avoid leaving any filament out for more than a day).\nIf you're not seeing any difference between, then I wouldn't worry about it.  Storing filament dry is a hassle.\n", "abs - Would 3d-printed objects outgas in vacuum?": "\nI found much the same question at Does PLA outgas? An answer there pointed to a NASA outgassing database, Outgassing Data for Selecting Spacecraft Materials, and says that:\n\nABS (unknown supplier), MakerGeeks PET and Makerbot PLA have been measured and are listed in the NASA database.\n\nPoster there recommended PLA for lower outgassing, and clear PLA because there would be fewer additives to complicate the problem.\n", "What type of plastic can be used to produce your own filament?": "\nFilament manufacturers (for example, Colorfabb) also sell pellets, price per kilo would be about 10 times less than the same plastic in filament form.\nOut of household garbage only ABS can be easily extruded into filament with Filabot-grade machine. PET AKA plastic bottles looks promising as well.\nYou can also use certain products \"off-label\". For example, string trimmer string (line) is simply a nylon filament and can be used as-is in modern diameter-agnostic hot end.\n", "Is it legal to make a fire weapon with a 3D printer?": "\nSort of.\nFully plastic guns are banned in the United States by the Undetectable Firearms Act, because they can pass unseen through metal detectors - a huge problem. One way around this is to insert a slip of metal into the gun, thereby making it detectable by metal detectors. 3D-printed guns made of metal - were that possible - would not violate the law.\nThe UFA was originally enacted in 1988, extended from 2003 to 2013, and then again until 2023. It may seem a bit unnecessary, as all-plastic guns, like the famous Liberator have structural issues that make them extremely difficult to fire when compared to a normal all-metal gun. However, then can be used.\nIn Europe, gun laws vary widely by country. The European Firearms Directive is the main international agreement on gun laws, but its application varies, and it does not directly address 3D-printed guns.\nI'm not aware of a country that has an explicit law banning 3D-printed guns. The only countries that ban them either unintentionally cover them or ban guns altogether.\n", "post processing - What can I use to \"sand\" my ABS prints?": "\nI have a bunch of solutions to this problem but I'm always looking for additional ideas. I usually start by slicing as much as possible off with a hobby knife. The more than can be removed before sanding the better.\nFor big prints I like big generic sandpaper sheets from the hardware store. Starting with the highest grit and moving down. Make sure you're discarding your sheets when they get totally gunked up (which can happen pretty fast) or you won't get much done.\nFor smaller nooks and crannies I have a set of needle files. They do a pretty good job clearing out screw holes and smaller features on printed sculptures.\nI've also had some success sanding with my Dremel when it comes to annoying stuck on supports or other imperfections. Having some horsepower behind your sanding can be a nice break. I've also seen the wire brush attachments used for finishing Bronze and Copper-fill prints. Just keep an eye on your speed or you'll sand a hole in your print.\nLastly (and one I haven't tried) are these sanding sticks They were recommended by a friend and look like they would be pretty easy to use/swap out used sandpaper. \n", "What is a good way to estimate the impact on material strength different printing methods will have?": "\nIt's hard to tell without actually testing the part. There are many ways you can 3D print a part, even on the same machine, that can yield different results.\nHere are some tips to help uphold strength requirements:\n\nIdentify where your stresses are and avoid allowing the natural \"grain\" of the print (i.e. each layer) to coincide with the stresses of the part. For example, I just printed a part with hinges today. I set my part up to ensure that the circular profile of the hinge on each layer, instead of having the machine \"bridge\" the circular profile.\nMake your part more solid by increasing the infill. Note that somewhere around 35% won't really provide much more strength than say 50% with a standard infill pattern (i.e. hexagonal, diamond, catfill). However, I would imagine that if a spherical infill pattern was ever designed, that would be the strongest.\nAn easy way to beef up small areas of a part is to increase your shell variable (how many profile layers for each layer). Again, referencing my hinge design, I made sure that my hinges were completely printed using shell instead of shell/infill.\nDon't be afraid to do some post-processing such as adding epoxy/epoxies in high-stress areas.\n\nIf it's not an expensive part to print, I would suggest playing with some of these ideas yourself and conduct controlled tests to see what setups work best for your application(s).\n", "How can I set the 1st layer after a raft in Slic3r to print at 1st layer speed": "\nThis is still work in progress, and here is what I have so far, but first:\nA useful alternative for similar problems:\nA problem very similar to this would be to use different settings for different parts of a model in Slic3r. For most settings, this can be achieved through modifier meshes.\nPost processing scripts:\nAs far as I know, Slic3r does not give you the option of setting the speed of the first layer after a raft directly, but they do allow you to run post processing scripts; that is, to automatically run a set of operations - programmed by you - on the g-code output.\nAlthough far from trivial, you can in theory make a program that runs through the output g-code, adjusts the settings to your preference, and then saves it again at the target destination.\nTuning overall printer speed through g-code:\nAs it turns out, there is a simple g-code command that sets the overall speed of your printer's operation:\nM220 S[some number]     ; see the link above for compatible firmware\n\nA newsletter from Reprapwold explains that:\n\nFor example M220 S50 will reduce the speed to 50%\n  of the original sliced G-code. If you want to hurry your print to the finish in time\n  for dinner, use M220 S200, to print twice as fast (200%)\n\nIn other words, just like some printers allow you the change speed mid-print, you can use the M220 command to override the current speed used, either through a user interface such as PrintRun, or by fiddling with the original g-code itself.\nManipulating the g-code output to adjust speed settings:\nThe easiest way to achieve our goal would be to manually manipulate the output g-code file through a text editor, and insert our M220 command in appropriate places:\n\nSet M220 S50 just before the first perimeter layer (after the raft's interface layer), to slow down the first layer of the actual model.\nSet M220 S100 sometime after the first perimeter layer, to resume the normal speed settings.\n\nIn order to do this, though, we need to be able to distinguish these two points in the g-code output.\nDistinguishing insertion points:\nSlic3r offers a setting under Print Settings -> Output options -> Verbose G-code that - when enabled - inserts written comments all throughout the g-code files generated.  \nIf one inspects a g-code file outputted for a model with raft, one will find the comment:\n; move to first perimeter point      <- lets call this A\n\nand \n; move to next layer (x)             <- lets call this B\n\nlittered several places throughout the gcode. \nIt is under my impression that the first occurrence of comment A happens right after the raft is finished, and before the actual model is being printed, while the first occurrence of comment B succeeding comment A can be used to set the speed back to normal.\nIt should be noted, however, that the comments in the output g-code does not seem fully consistent, and I would therefore not recommend anyone to automate this logic into a script without possibly finding other, more reliable breakpoints, and thoroughly verify these through several different models. \nI have not looked into the details of writing an automatic script for this task as of yet.\n", "stepper - What are the benefits to using 128X microstepping drivers on the X and Y axis of a FFF printer?": "\nYou will likely not see a noticeable improvement by upgrading from a 16x or 32x to a 64x or 128x microstepping driver. Depending on the motors you're driving and the size of the load you could actually see a decrease in quality.\nAlthough microstepping increases theoretical resolution it does not necessarily increase accuracy. The reason is that microstepping significantly limits the incremental torque of the motor. This means that you may ask for a step but not get one because the torque of the step won't be enough to actually turn the shaft.\nAs an example: a motor running in full steps will have 100% of its rated holding torque. Moving to 16 microsteps/full steps drops this to ~10%, 128 drops it to ~1%.\nThe practical effect of this is that in high torque situations (such as printing at fast speeds) the motor may end up skipping some of the steps. In this way the increase in resolution can actually lead to a decrease in accuracy (smaller steps but they may not actually be taken).\nA relevant calculation to do would be to work out what the different number of microsteps to full steps works out to in terms of horizontal, vertical, or whatever movement the motor drives. You can do this by measuring how far the stepper moves said surface in one revolution provided you know the number of steps it takes per revolution.\nExample: \nWith no microstepping: 1 turn/inch * 200 steps/turn = 200 steps/inch or .005 inch/step (127 micron resolution)\nWith 16x microstepping: 16 * 200 steps/inch or .0003 inch / step (8 micron resolution)\nIn this example 128x microstepping would be absolutely foolish. Every situation is different and you should use this information to make a decision based on your setup. Many manufacturers have recommendations on how far their motors can be microstepped.\n", "electronics - Do stepper motors require any maintenance?": "\nThe stepper motor itself does not.  You may want to inspect the motors for debris or dust.\nDepending on your configuration you may want to check on parts of your printer that connect to your stepper motor such as shaft couplings, pulleys, lead screws/threaded rods and belts.  The stepper motor wires should occasionally be inspected for wear and strain.\n", "safety - Which are the food-safe materials and how do I recognize them?": "\nFood safety is a property of both the process and the material. You can't stick food-safe material in a printer that has previously been used to print something food-dangerous and expect the result to be food safe.\nThe only way to know if a given material is food-safe is to ask your supplier, but a lot depends on how you then process it. For instance, FDM printers often have brass nozzles, which contain lead. To print food-safe materials, you need to use a stainless steel nozzle.\nFood safe materials can be identified by mean of an universal symbol.\nMoreover, to ensure food-safety of a 3D printed model you may need to further process it (for instance, by vapor smoothing or coating with a food-safe lacquer). Some claims circulate on the internet that 3D printed models may have surface porosity in which bacteria can grow, but I've not been able to find a reliable source for this claim. Still, you need to be cautious.\n", "fdm - What can cause a sudden and dramatic loss in the inter-layer registration of my prints?": "\nThere are many factors, here are a few things to check:\nI'd first suspect filament feeding.  This type of ridging can be caused by a filament coil that is binding occasionally, or a filament that doesn't have an even diameter or volume per length.  Binding within the filament feeder and feeder tubes can also be a cause. Bubbles in the filament, or sometimes a mismatch between the filament ideal temperature and the head temperature could create results like this, but it probably wouldn't vary so much between the layers.\nNext I'd look at the print head.  If it has blockages, or poor temperature control this could result.\nLastly, I'd check the mechanisms - disconnect the motors and see if all the carriages slide smoothly without any binding, particularly the Z axis.  It doesn't look like you're missing steps, but binding here may result in greater backlash, which could result in similar ridges. Make sure any belts and gears are tight.\n", "filament - Which are the strongest and most durable materials?": "\nSo, as you say you want to materials for printing robotics parts. And as you have not given any budget constraint, I would give you a list of materials which would help you achieve the task, and you can choose amongst them accordingly.\n\nPlastics: Basically used for building prototypes. Nylon Polyamide should be a choice for you.\n\n\nPolyamide 3D printing is achieved through SLS 3D printing. It offers\n  strong and flexible prints. The upside of this material is that the\n  printing technology requires minimum preparation of the 3D file before\n  printing. There is no need for support. And it also offers the\n  possibility to create intricate shapes and moving part in just one go.\n  After the print the polyamide can be polished and dyed.\n\n\nMetals: Metals like Brass, Alumunium and Steel should be a good choice.\n\nBut, if I were to achieve your task, I would select carbon fiber. some details about it:\n\nCarbon fiber consists of 90% carbon atoms, each fiber is 10 times\n  thinner than a human hair. Carbon is especially prized for its lack of\n  combustibility and infusability but also by its incredible strength\n  (stronger than steel) and ability to create flexible structure, light\n  weight and corrosion resistance. Its melting temperature is 1500, this\n  heat there are only carbon.\n\n", "health - Are there biocompatible materials available to the general public?": "\nThere are printers designed for medical use, and the manufacturers supply them with varying levels of certification and testing, however I've not seen a filament manufacturer certify their material as bio-compatible separate from the printer. The printing process changes the material slightly in the best case (and significantly with poor temperature control or badly set parameters), so even if bio-compatible filament were found, the resulting product might not achieve the same level of bio-compatibility.\nIf your intent is to use hobbyist level machine for medical purposes, you might simply want to use an interface, such as a sock or a molded/cast polymer that you know to be bio-compatible between the printed part and the skin.\n", "print preparation - Online APIs for 3D printing services": "\nThere are a few methods to simplify your workflow.  Two solutions are outlined below and both feature a documented API you can use to further customize your workflow.\nOctoPrint was mentioned by other users.  OctoPrint will allow you to configure your printer, print profiles and upload STLs for printing from a web interface.  You can configure profiles, slicers and slicer profiles for OctoPrint to use to complete your workflow.\nAstroprint offers cloud slicing services in addition to features allowing you to manage printers and print profiles.\n", "legal - Can I print my own Lego bricks?": "\nThe patents that cover Lego bricks have expired, so you are free to print bricks using the same interlocking system. You are even allowed to offer such prints commercially.\nWhat is not allowed (and a violation of trademark law) is to call them \"Lego bricks\" or use Lego's logo. \"Compatible with Lego\" on the other hand, would be fine.\n", "legal - I've exported 3D models from the game, can I print them?": "\nNo. Such figures are generally covered by copyright, which means that nobody but the copyright holder is allowed to (re-)produce copies of the work. Copyright also covers personal use. In the US there are limited fair use exceptions but they do not apply here.\nThe only way to do this legally is if it is specifically authorized in a license or if you get permission.\n", "desktop printer - How to print edible food?": "\nYou cannot print edible models using a \"standard\" consumer 3D printer without first installing an \"hot end\" capable of depositing edible - normally thicker - substances as well as a suitable extruder mechanism. \nHowever, there are not necessarily any technical limitations in the electronics, software, slicers etc. in a typical printer that wouldn't allow you to install such an upgrade. For instance, you could calibrate your extrusion rate and nozzle width to suit batter and similar.\nSome commercial printers, such as the DeltaWASP allow for upgrades that print clay, which wouldn't be very different from printing liquid food.\n", "legal - Printing copyrighted objects as a print shop for a customer": "\nThere are two aspects to this question that probably should be addressed separately.  This is not legal advice and I'm not a lawyer, so consult with an experienced IP attorney.\nCopyright law may apply, and other IP laws, such as patents and trademarks, may apply.  They each have different requirements and restrictions.\nNotably, IP law varies from country to country.  WIPO has made significant inroads into regularizing IP law across many countries, but this answer will still focus on a US-centric reading of US IP law.\nCopyright law\nIt's already established that printed works, such as photographs, texts, and similar works will result in prosecution against the person and the company that the person outsourced the copying of the copyrighted work to.  Attempt to copy a book or copyrighted photo at a paper copy shop and they will typically refuse to reduce their liability.\nEven if you show that you have rights to the work, through educational use laws, for instance, they may still refuse because they may be putting themselves in danger of a lawsuit by a particularly aggressive copyright holder.\nThis applies to 3D printing shops in a similar manner.  If you don't know the source of the 3D model, and that the person has a right to the model, you may find yourself liable for copyright infringement.  Even if you are sure, a lawsuit can financially ruin your business if it comes from a large corporation.\nPatents\nPatents apply even if you were unaware of them.  So any model you print that contains patented techniques, technology, or concepts may also pull you, as the print shop, into a lawsuit for patent infringement. \nReducing liability\nA suitable contract with the person requesting the 3D print, as written by an IP lawyer, may reduce, but not eliminate, your liability. It won't completely absolve you of all responsibility, but may reduce your exposure to such lawsuits, and give you some leverage in court should someone prosecute you.\n", "safety - Can you use PLA material with food and drinks?": "\nAs others have pointed out, PLA isn't specifically not food safe, but materials that have been printed previously can contaminate the PLA.\nAdditionally, anything 3D printed is extremely porous. Once a part is used for food, moisture and bacteria will accumulate in the pores, and can never be completely cleaned out, contaminating any food that contacts it. It can't be sterilized either, because the temperatures needed for sterilization would deform or melt the plastic.\n", "slic3r - Why do some models appear broken in slicing software?": "\nMy understanding is that this occurs when the object is not a true solid. Since an STL holds the triangulation of each face and spline, the slicing engine is not \"smart\" enough to determine if there is a gap in the model and therefore if it should be filled in and how. When the slicer encounters a gap, it will either treat the endpoint as the end of the feature or navigate to the next point on the layer, resulting in either gaps in the print or extra inclusions that don't make sense.\nI've noticed that my models will fail as a true solid when I use complex solid tools such as Union, Subtract, and Trim. A lot of times there will be a rounding error in how these tools interact with the solid model that will result in a small (sometimes not very small) gap in the outer shell of the solid model. When exported to an STL, the gap is retained.\n@kareem mentioned it in their answer, but Microsoft does provide online tool(s) for 3D Printing including a solid repair tool. Use Microsoft 3D Tools to upload your STL and try to automatically detect and fix issues with your file(s).\n", "What criteria do I need to be aware of when buying a 3D printer for personal use?": "\nHere are few things to consider from my point of view\n\nPrinting technology\nThe first thing that you need to take into account is printing technology. The most common[citation needed] right now is Fused Filament Fabrication. \"Liquid light-sensitive resin\" is being used in Stereolitography and Digital Light Processing - the SLA printers I found are less common and more expensive than FFF ones.\n\nPrice\nNeed to decide on budget. You can buy printer for 60k USD and 400 USD. Quality is somehow linked to price but that's not a rule. You can buy a shitty printer for a lot of money.\n\nPrinting area\nBigger allows you to print bigger things. You need to ask yourself how big things you really want to print. Remember that 3d printing is quite slow process - how often you will want to print big things that will take 60hrs+ to finish?\n\nPrinting materials\nWhat kind of materials you want to print with? Some materials will need higher temperatures so check the max hot-end temperature, some will require heated bed.\n\nAssembled or DIY kit\nYou can usually get kits for self-assembly cheaper than Ready-To-Print machines. However, it will require additional skills (i.e. soldering), tools and time to assemble. I am not sure if I would buy DIY kit for commercial use, but as an enthusiast I immensely enjoyed putting my Rostock Max together.\n\nReviews and reputation\nIt is generally safe to buy printer that already has some users. Beware of new magical Kickstarter printers which will \"change the 3d printing forever\".\nReddit /r/3dprinting suggests that your new printer should meet 3 criteria:\n\nPrinter passes the youtube test - has lots of youtube evidence that this particular printer is working.\nPrinter is out of the pre-order phase. This means that all pre-orders have been delivered.\nPrinter has a reputation of working well among current users.\n\nI found it to be a very good set of rules.\n\nUpgrade capabilities\nThat's very user-dependent, but this point is very important to me. I want to be able to change and improve certain parts of my printer. Check if you can switch the extruder, replace the hot-end etc. \n\nSupport\nI think one of the most important points. See if you can find a forum for your printer and how active community is. It will be immensely helpful if something goes wrong (and it will).\nAlso, company support is very important. What will happen if you need a replacement part or your printer will stop working altogether?\n\nThis list is definitely not complete.\nThere are many more things that might be taken into account like configuration (delta or XY), multiple extruders, closed cases etc.\n", "reprap - Tips for not burning out my Arduino Mega or catching something on fire when wiring a Prusa i3?": "\n\nPolarity matters, sometimes. Be especially mindful of the wires from your power supply to the board, as getting those the wrong way around will definitely cause damage. Heated beds and extruders are not polarity sensitive, and can go in either way. Fans are polarized, but will probably survive if you get them backwards - they just won't run. Stepper motors don't care about polarity, flipping the connector around just makes them run backwards.\nTake special care with endstops. The endstop connectors have 3 pins (VCC, 5V and signal), endstops with 2 pins are usually connect to GND and signal. Putting a 2-pin endstop across 5V and GND will destroy the 5V regulator.\nA common cause of damage is wires not being clamped in their respective terminals properly. The offending wire will arc, melting and destroying the connector. Tighten down screw terminals properly, use proper crimps if you have them. Soldering the ends of wires going into screw terminals is not encouraged, but if you do solder the ends then make sure to check after a while and tighten the screws again.\nPut the stepper drivers in the right way around.\nFor things like the heated bed and wires going to your power supply, use sufficiently thick wires. Especially with the heated bed, a lot of current flows through the wires and flimsy wires will heat up and melt.\n\n", "fdm - How do I do multi-colour printing?": "\nThere are a few different approaches I've seen which you could look into.\nThe easiest and most common is multiple extruders, each with a different color of thermoplastic. Tools like Pronterface and Slic3r have built-in support for multiple extruders. With multiple extruders you can get one color per extruder; there's no clear way to mix colors and get a color between the input materials' colors.\nAnother, more complicated approach is to use a single extruder with three inputs, like this one, where thermoplastic from the three inputs can be mixed in varying amounts to get color gradients between the input colors. With red, yellow, and blue filament, you could get a rainbow of colors...albeit without any control over value (white to black) or saturation (bright vs dull color).\n", "print preparation - How can I calculate volumetric speed for Slic3r auto speed?": "\nAuto speed is calculated from maximum volumetric speed in mm3 per second. If you normally print at 80 mm/s, your extrusion width is 0.5 mm and you are printing 0.2mm high layers, your volumetric speed would be 80 * 0.5 * 0.2 = 8 mm3/s, which is the volume of plastic extruded by your printer every second when printing at that speed (not accounting for any die swell).\n", "extruder - How to get consistent and accurate readings from thermocouples?": "\nThermocouples work by passively generating VERY small voltages via the Seebeck effect -- usually a few tens of millivolts. They're literally just a pair of wires made from two different special alloys, electrically connected together at the \"hot\" end. That wire junction can be mounted inside whatever kind of attachment tip or lug is desired.\nThe fact that they're very simple and passive devices makes them extremely precise and consistent between TCs of the same type, MUCH more so than thermistors. Any type-K thermocouple in the world will give you the same accurate output +/-1-2C or so. You can even cut a thermocouple in half, re-twist the ends of the wires together, and it'll still work! \nHowever, the very small (millivolts) signal they generate is quite susceptible to electrical noise and circuit design. The signal voltage has to be greatly amplified to be useful. So it doesn't take much EMR from your heater or stepper wires to interfere with the TC reading. A frequent problem with TC circuits in 3d printers is the dreaded GROUND LOOP -- if the \"hot\" tip is electrically connected to the hot block, voltage and current on the heater and motor wires can induce small currents through the TC wires that totally screw up the millivolt signal. The amplifier picks up these stray voltages and it throws off the temp read. So, there are some important guidelines for keeping noise out of the TC wires:\n\nThe TC wires must be electrically insulated from the mounting hardware (eye lug, thermowell, whatever your extruder has). You can check this with a multimeter -- you want infinite / out of range resistance from the TC leads to the mounting tip and hot block. While you're at it, make sure your heater cartridge wires aren't shorting to the hot block -- that's unsafe and can also cause problems with TCs.\nKeep the two TC wires close together, and not immediately parallel to noise sources like PWM-controlled heaters or stepper wiring. If you must run the TC in a bundle with the other wires, TWIST the heater/stepper wiring pairs. (For steppers, twist each coil pair to a different pitch if possible. You don't need to twist the separate coil pairs to each other.) \n\nAnother common issue with TC circuits is the COLD JUNCTION COMPENSATION. A thermocouple doesn't measure tip temperature, it measures the DIFFERENCE in temperature between the hot tip and the cold junction where the TC is connected to either the amp or copper wiring. The TC amp has an onboard thermistor that it uses to add the temp at the cold junction to the measured signal from the thermocouple. There are a few things you need to do to make sure the cold-junction compensation works properly:\n\nYou should run TC wire all the way from the \"hot\" tip to the TC amp. You CAN splice it and install plugs, but only with more type-K TC wire and proper type-K thermocouple plugs. These use the same metal as the TC wire so they don't generate undesired junction voltages that interfere with the TC signal. If you splice copper wire between the TC and the amp, any temp differences along the copper will not be measured! This is a particularly big problem if you splice to copper inside a warm enclosure and then run copper to an amp outside the enclosure.\nThe amp should not be super hot. The onboard thermistor is designed to accurately measure temperatures reasonably close to room temp, not hot-block temps. \nThere should not be large temperature gradients near the amp or between the TC wire termination and the actual amp chip. Place the amp far enough away from the hot end and other heat sources (like stepper motors) that it isn't experiencing weird temp profiles.\n\nIf you do the above, the TC will output a good signal, and the amp will read it properly. But there's one more hitch. The mainboard has to know how to understand the amp's output. 3D printer control boards that are designed exclusively for TCs, like Mightyboards, usually use digital communication between the amp and the main control chip (MCU). This is high-reliability and does not require any special firmware configuration -- support is baked in. But if you're strapping an external TC amp onto a board that is expecting thermistors, you will have to tell the firmware how to read the signal from the amp. The most common technique is for the amp to output a linear voltage signal to the MCU's normal thermistor input (ADC). Then you configure the firmware to use the appropriate \"thermistor table\" (really a voltage lookup table) for that particular amp. Depending on your controller board, you also may need to make sure the regular thermistor pull-up/pull-down resistors aren't affecting the amp's output.\nSo you need to make sure:\n\nYou don't have electrical noise issues\nThe cold-junction compensation is working as intended\nThe firmware and controller board is configured correctly for your amp chip's output\n\nIf you do all that, a TC should give superior accuracy and reliability over a thermistor. \n", "quality - What is the life expectancy of the Kossel?": "\nMuch like your car, the number of miles, or the number of prints that you can get out of it is entirely up to how well you can maintain it.\nA 3D Printer is a machine, and a machine needs general maintenance; if you see something starting to break - or get worn out - or anything abnormal, fix it.\nI am sure that if you had something like a MakerBot, it would require less maintenance then a fully home built machine, but if you are building it from scratch, I am sure you don't mind.\nI am still rocking a 3 year old home built MendalMax, and have both made some improvements, and had to make some repairs along the way - but it is still in damn good condition.\nFor a $600 investment, I can say you will get a few years out of it if you take proper care of it.

Once the print is done you can weigh it on a kitchen scale.\nPLA Filament currently runs about \\$23/kg on Amazon, which works out to \\$0.023/g. Multiplication can then give you a good estimate of materials costs for a print.\nOnly experience with your specific printer will give you an idea of how often you're going to hit a failed print, and how often you're going to need to replace parts.

In case that term isn't familiar to all readers, here's a little more detail:\n\nEstablish an acceleration value that you're sure is too low (call it $L$), and one that you're sure is too high ($H$). It sounds like you know such values already from experience.\nFigure out the speed in the middle: $(L+H)/2$.  Call that $M$.\nTry printing at speed $M$. Something like a stepped calibration cube might be a good choice of object (plenty available on Thingiverse).\nIf $M$ is still too fast, take $M$ as your new high-speed limit (that is, reset $H$ to the value of $M$), and repeat from step #2.\nIf it's slow enough to work, take $M$ as your new low-speed limit ($L$), and repeat from step #2.\n\nEach repetition will cut the range in half. Keep repeating until $L$ and $H$ get as close as you want; say, within 5\u00a0% of each other or so.\nI wouldn't bother trying to get super-close, because the workable value will vary somewhat over time (friction from dust getting on various parts; slight voltage differences; different mass and pulling tension for the filament roll, temperature of motors, complexity of the object you're printing, behavior of the slicing program you use, you name it).\n", "fdm - How do I keep my extruder head from getting clogged?": "\nDifferent types of hotends and extruders can lead to different problems associated with clogging. Based on my personal experience the leading causes of clogs and jams are the following\n\nForeign material in the nozzle (dirt, dust, low quality filament)\nMixing materials in the hotend (running ABS at 220 then switching to PLA without purging the nozzle)\nExcessive retraction or \"heat soak\" in PLA (PLA expands when heated if your retraction is set to high you can actually push the expanded PLA high enough that it cools down and can no longer flow)\n\nTo solve these issues I recommend using one type of filament, preferably decent quality (typically $40 per kg), if you swap materials be sure to completely purge your nozzle of the higher temperature material. Set your retraction as low as you can trying to minimize ooze (try .4 mm for all metal hotend or 2-3 mm for makerbot style). To minimize carbonized plastic in your hotend don't leave your hotend's heater on for extended periods of time. One way to keep dust from accumulating on your filament is to cover your rolls when you aren't using them, I personally use hairnets, you can buy a 12 pack for a couple of dollars and they last for a long time.\n", "maintenance - How can I best clean the print bed after a print?": "\n\nIf you are printing with ABS (or PLA), acetone will dissolve it.  Simply pour\nsome on the bed and wipe it off (beware, acetone can damage beds that have a coating or a plastic sheet over them, be sure to test this first).\n\nHeating the bed back up may make the plastic softer and easier to\nremove.\n\nIf you are using tape on the bed, you could remove the tape to remove\nthe plastic stuck to the tape.\n\n\n", "fdm - My heated glass print bed keeps chipping and cracking. How can I prevent this?": "\nI use the glue stick method. I like to take my build plate out and put it in the freezer. The different coefficients of thermal expansion between the glass and plastic usually means that the part just pops off in the freezer.\n", "fdm - How thin can I make the wall of a pipe?": "\nThe thinnest wall your printer can print is determined by its nozzle size, and will be a little thicker than that nozzle size.\nA great challenge when dealing with thin, hollow cylinders is that the cross-section has very little surface area and it can delaminate easily, especially if the tube is long.\nYou could try printing the tube with a very thick extrusion with, and using only a single perimeter. That would give better gas-tightness and layer adhesion than two, thinner perimeters, but it may turn out too fragile for your application. In that case, you'll need to print additional perimeters. Sticking to thicker extrusion widths would still be beneficial.\nAt a two centimeter diameter I'd say the single perimeter has a decent chance of working if you handle them gingerly.\n", "firmware - How do I set the G-code buffer size on Marlin?": "\nMarlin does allow one to change the size of the buffers, in Configuration_adv.h. In the current version there's an ifdef that switches between two cases, one with SD support, and the other without. Both have a movement planner of size 16, which can be adjusted.\nAdditionally, in the same file, BUFSIZE can be changed to modify the size of the buffer storing unparsed commands before they are parsed and enter the movement planner buffer.\nAdditionally, for some firmwares, M112 will immediately shut down the printer, no matter what is in the buffer, but the reset button will need to be used, and the axes will not be homed afterward. In Marlin, it's hardcoded to call kill().\n", "maintenance - How should I clean my extruder when changing materials?": "\nIf you feel you need to clean the nozzle the best approach is a cold pull.  You can perform this procedure with many printers, however, you should seek advice from your printer manufacturer before attempting this process if you have any doubts.\nWith the previously filament still loaded and the tool head cold:\n\nBegin to raise the temperature of the tool to the printing temperature of the next filament you intend to load\nAs it begins to warm up perform any tasks you normally perform during filament unloading (open the idler, for example). You should not be fighting against the extruder drive gear or any other part of the tool during this process!\nWith a fair amount of pressure begin pulling on the filament\nThe old filament should eventually release from inside of the tool leaving the end of the filament roughly in a nice molded shape of the inside of the tool.  Begin loading the next filament you intend to print and manually feed some filament through as the tool finishes heating\n\nAnything left over from the previous filament including pigment or other residue should be stuck to the end of the filament.\nYou can perform cold pulls as many times as you wish by loading new filament, extruding a small amount, letting it completely cool and repeating the steps.\n", "Bulging filaments - How can catch them before they go in the printer": "\nThat's my picture :-)\nI use a filament monitor with an encoder wheel that pauses the print if the filament stops moving (because a bulge got stuck, or filament ran out, or the hot end jammed, or whatever). I have a bunch of these on multiple printers: http://www.toybuilderlabs.com/products/tunell-3d-printer-filament-monitor\nThe Tunell monitor works with Sailfish, Marlin, and Smoothie to my knowledge. This particular one doesn't work with Repetier, but you can wire up a simple encoder wheel to use Repetier's filament monitor functionality.\nLike other people have mentioned, you should avoid cheap filament, and return spools with bulges. I personally only see bulges like that maybe every 20 spools or less. \n", "electronics - Issue with weird heated bed temperature fluctuations": "\nIt really looks like either a bad thermistor or bad electrical joints. Are the connections to the thermistor itself crimped, or soldered? Are there connectors near the thermistor that can get heated up by the bed?\nElectrical connections that are mechanical in nature (such as crimped, or using a connector) can degrade quickly in heated situations, particularly when the heating is intermittent.  Consider replacing crimped connections with soldered joints where possible, and where not possible use gold plated connectors and crimps to avoid oxidation issues. Oxidation and poor mechanical connections will change resistance based on movement, giving you apparent increases or decreases in sensor readings even when the sensor output is unchanged.\nChances are good that the thermistor itself is fine, but that the connection nearest the thermistor, between the wires and the thermistor, is faulty. If it's crimped, you may be able to simply add flux, then solder it to increase the bonding between the wires and the thermistor and decrease future issues with oxidation.\nNote that soldering is really only useful for the thermistor on the bed.  The head thermistor must be crimped, as the head temperatures can exceed solder temperatures depending on the target temperature and the solder alloy.\n", "slic3r - Marlin menu navigation slow while printing": "\nA Delta printer requires constant complex calculations to produce straight lines while printing.  The firmware, therefore, spends most of its time figuring out the step and timing sequence, and only the little remaining time between interrupts and these calculations is given to the user interface.\nMarlin doesn't document any configuration parameters that would improve the user interface responsiveness, and in any case such improvement must necessarily come at the cost of printing speed and/or accuracy.  The processor is being used to its maximum capacity.  The only thing you might be able to do is dig into the firmware and try to change it yourself, as this is not a clear option within Marlin.\nIf working with the user interface while printing is important to you, your next step should probably be to change to a faster 32 bit processor. There are a few firmwares available for ARM and other architectures which may resolve your situation.\n", "fdm - How to print an overhanging arc": "\nYou could modify it as shown in my picture.  I added lines tangent to the 11mm circle and in this example I set them to a 40 degree overhang which should be fine, the top line is also tangent to the circle and in my experience it's easier to bridge a small section rather than do a bunch of small overhangs like an arc would do.  You still end up with quite a bit of contact but also easy to print.\nI did something similar to this on my printer where the smooth rods enter horizontal holes.\n\n", "Can I mix ABS and PLA when recycling filament?": "\nThis is not a good idea. Both filaments have different melting points, that of ABS being much higher than that of PLA. To melt the ABS you have to heat the plastic to the point where the PLA starts to degrade.\n", "quality - Optimal ratio of fresh to used nylon powder": "\nYou'll find generally that mixing 40% new polyamide with 60% recycled polyamide will result in a reasonable finish and part. You will obviously want to use all new for parts requiring the best possible finish and mechanical properties, but this mixture will be very difficult to tell apart from a fully new mixture part:\nhttp://www.paramountind.com/pdfs/eos_pa2200_mds.pdf\nThis is more detailed research showing how used powder changes and how that affects print quality here:\nhttp://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/13552540910960299\nSearching for the research paper title may find a free source, but the linked resource does require a subscription or payment to that service.\n", "How to minimize damage when removing an ABS print from a heated glass print bed?": "\nI moved to a plain glass heated bed with a brush applied acetone and ABS mixture. Using an old emptied nail polish bottle with brush, I added some acetone and then threw in ABS pieces until it reached a brush-able consistency. I then brush it on the glass build plate where I believe the print will occur, and it works very well. On removal of the part the coating comes with it.\nI just found previously that ABS would adhere to my kapton taped heated bed too strongly to use, and so while this involves a little work before each print, it's overall better than kapton for me.\nI did experiment with sheet metal beds coated with kapton, but they curl during printing due to the ABS thermal stress, allowing my parts to be concave on the bottom side. Easy to remove from the plate, though, since it flexed. There may be a good middle ground material but I didn't experiment further.\n", "heated bed - Does the material a bed is made out of affect the cooling time of a part?": "\nWhat bed material cools faster?\nI found an extensive list which relates various materials to their thermal conductivity, k [W/mK]; the lower thermal conductivity, the better the material insulates, and the slower the print bed will resist changes in temperature - both heating up, and cooling down. \nHere are the thermal conductivity for some common materials for 3d printer beds:\nAluminum    205\nGlass       1.05\nAcrylic     0.2\nAir         0.024 (for reference)\n\nThere is also the matter of thermal capacity, but I will not go into that right now (need to do some research myself first!).\nWill bed material affect cooling time?\nBed material, I believe, is not necessarily related to print cooldown time: it depends on the situation, such as whether we are discussing cooldown during or after printing, and if the bed is heated or not. \n\nIf you are not using a heated bed, I believe the bed material doesn't matter at all.\nWith a heated bed while printing, only the first dozen layers or so are probably affected by the rising heat sufficiently that it affects the printing process.\nWith a heated bed after printing, the thermal characteristics of the bed will determine how quickly the print cools (and thus can be removed).\n\nAlso remember that other physical properties, such as flatness (both cold and during heating) of the bed material is vital for successful prints, and that not all materials can tolerate heating equally well! \n", "fdm - When to use 1.75 mm vs 3 mm filament?": "\nThere's no appreciable difference. Just use the filament that fits your particular printer.\nIf you don't yet have a printer, then I'd get one that uses 1.75\u00a0mm filament:\n\n1.75\u00a0mm is increasingly becoming the \"standard\", thus being easier to get. Some filaments are not available as 3\u00a0mm.\n1.75\u00a0mm filament allows for finer control, because feeding in 1\u00a0mm of filament corresponds to less plastic extruded.\n1.75\u00a0mm filament requires less force to extrude. Compressing 1.75\u00a0mm down to 0.3\u00a0mm takes less force than doing the same to 3\u00a0mm filament.\n\nHowever, the advantages are fairly minor. I don't see any reason to replace a functioning 3\u00a0mm extruder with a 1.75\u00a0mm one (yet).\n", "extruder - Can 1.75 mm filament be used in a printer that takes 3 mm filament?": "\nTypically an extruder and hot end are designed for one or the other, and cannot support the other without mechanical changes.\nThe extruder may not be able to grip a smaller diameter filament with enough force to assure even feeding and retraction.\nThe hot end, however, is much more complex. The filament has to be pushed with force into the melting zone, which means the filament has to slide along an area inside the hot end where the filament is plastic but still put pressure on the filament ahead of it.\nWhen you put filament into a hot end, the filament softens before the melt zone, but since the walls of the hot end are just barely larger than the filament it has no choice but to continue pressing down on the liquid filament below.\nWith a narrower diameter filament, though, the filament can heat, soften, then travel backwards along the sides of the hot end and cool in place, jamming the hot end, or at least preventing an even continuous flow of plastic.\nSome hot ends will accept a small Teflon tube that takes this space up and allows you to do this with fewer issues, and if you like to tinker you can experiment with this, but be prepared to learn a lot and fail a lot as you find out the hard lessons of hot end design.\nGenerally you should upgrade your entire extruder and hot end setup to the size you want to use.\n", "pla - Troubleshooting poor adhesion at the edge of the bed": "\nThere are several things you could try without spending much but even PLA will warp on an unheated bed.  I had a Legacy Kossel that I switched to an acrylic bed and had many issues with warping and prints pulling off the bed.  \nSome cheap things to try would be...\n\nAdding a brim to the print.\nBlue painters tape on the acrylic, remove the other material if doing this.\nPlace cheap piece of glass/mirror on bed and use hairspray/gluestick.\nUse hairspray/gluestick directly on acrylic.  You must be careful here because first layer height is very critical to prevent damage to the acrylic from the plastic welding.  A layer of hairspray or glue should prevent it but dial in your height before printing.\nIf you aren't currently using a fan, you could try sealing the sides to prevent drafts.  I doubt this would change much since you are using PLA but it's an option.\nIf these are your designs, there are steps you can take to reduce warping as seen here.\n\nAlso many other suggestions here.\n", "sls - Is packing multiple prints into the build volume a feasible workflow for powderbed printers?": "\nYes, this is very popular. Look into the site Shapeways and you will see that this is exactly what they do. I've also personally seen a local 3D print shop do this with their machine. It's called batching. I similar technique can be used in traditional machine shops (mills/lathes).\n", "heated bed - Applying Kapton Tape To Bed Plate": "\nI like to heat my build plate up a bit before I begin. Just warm to touch. I feel that this will help prevent bubbling so soon. I would think that since the build plate is expanded with the heat, that when the tape is applied it will shrink with the build plate. I was also told that the heat would help the adhesive stick better.\nThe other thing I do when applying kapton tape is apply one end of the tape to a ruler, place the ruler on the far side of the build plate, and slowly begin working the tape evenly across the plate. I find it much easier to apply tape this way.\n", "hotend - E3D Thermistor Alternative": "\nI like the mounting method on my Mk9 extruder: there's a small hole drilled into the heat block, parallel to the heater hole. B3 Innovations sells a thermistor packaged into a small spring. The whole assembly goes in the hole, and a setscrew (gently!) secures it. You could just as well put a bare thermistor into a spring or something similar; it's mainly to protect the thermistor from the setscrew, and from excessive bending.\nFrom your photo, it looks like the same thing would work fine for your hotend.\nHowever you mount it, adding some thermal grease can help conduction from the surroundings.\n", "reprap - How is a J-Head Extruder Head attached to the Prusa i3 rework?": "\nIt looks like the hotend may not be all the way in, are you sure it's not stuck?\nIf it's stuck and you can get it in further, those holes should go directly through the smaller ring on top of the J-Head.  You just need to run a machine screw into each hole to secure the hotend. The screw will need to at least be flush with the other side to work correctly.\n", "wiring - Are these the right types of electrical connectors for hooking my Switching Power Supply up to a wall outlet?": "\nIt is okay to just use bare wires in the type of screw connector found on your power supply. They're designed for it; they have a little plate under the screw that prevents the wires from being frayed by the screw.\nIf you want neater wire termination, you should use one of the spade type ones. Pick the smallest size that fits your wires.\nPC power cords are generally fitted with an IEC C13 plug, and those are rated for 10A (meaning also the wires themselves will be able to carry at least that much current). This is fine for any home 3D printer which usually draws a fraction of that.\n", "What are the other materials which can be used in DLP Printing, other than polymers?": "\nDLP doesn't use \"melted polymer\". It uses a photosenstive resin which is at room temperature and polymerizes when exposed to (UV) light. At no point is any material melted.\nAs such, steel or carbon fiber can not be used as these materials are not photosensitive.\n", "applications - How is 3D printing done in space?": "\nMost likely, the 3D-printers used on ISS does not incorporate some fundamental difference that allow them to print in zero gravity.\nSome people over at 3Dprint.com raised a very similar question, and figured that when turning their 3D-printer upside down and on it's side:\n\nthere\u2019s not really much difference at all. It\u2019s quite interesting to see how the orientation has little effect on the quality.\n\nOne of the early 3D-printer models - the Bukito printer - demonstrated that their printer was so portable it even could print on the move, and upside down.\nIn other words, some consumer 3D printers already print upside down, and so they would probably print in zero gravity as well!\n(That's the short story anyway. Have a look at Ryan's post, who gives a great description of the more intricate parts of space printing!) \n", "My endstops have 4 female plugs, but the examples on the RepRap Prusa i3 Site have 3; what are each of them for?": "\nThe website shows exactly what each wire is for.

Present conductive filaments are much less conductive than copper. The power loss may be enough to affect functionality. Also, the lost power goes to heat, making the thermal problems worse.\nFor bulk materials, \"volume resistivity\" is measured in \"Ohm-cm\", which is the resistance of a 1 cm cube of the material, measured from one entire face to the opposite entire face (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity).\nCopper has a volume resistivity of about 1.68 microOhm-cm. \nProto-pasta conductive PLA filament claims 15 ohm-cm (http://www.proto-pasta.com/pages/conductive-pla). Functionalize F-Electic\u2122 claims 0.75 ohm-cm (http://functionalize.com/about/functionalize-f-electric-highly-conductive-filament/).\nPrinting itself significantly raises resistivity. Proto-pasta claims 30 ohm-cm along X and Y, 115 along Z. More intuitively, each cm of length of a 2.5mm wide printed trace, 0.4mm thick, should add several hundred ohms with the Proto-pasta, or several tens of ohms with the F-electric. That may be enough to matter. \nIt's probably worth mentioning that there's a specialized PCB printer (the \"Voltera\") that uses (pricey) conductive ink, and can also dispense solder paste: http://www.computerworld.com/article/2885188/3d-circuit-board-printer-a-smash-hit-on-kickstarter.html\n", "desktop printer - How to achieve dimensional accuracy of printed parts": "\nI think the best way to go about this would be to calibrate your printer and slicer as best you can.  One of my pet peeves is when people upload STLs that have been adjusted to fit their printer/material.  There are many suppliers of material that vary in quality as well as many materials and different printers that the tolerances shouldn't be built into the part because in the end it usually just makes it harder for others attempting to print the model.\nIf you aren't sharing models then all I can say is you are still better off to calibrate your printer and tune your slicer to your material.  You'll have more luck with models from other people and have an easier time designing your own.  \nIf you still have trouble then modifying the model is probably the last option.  I don't know of any CAD programs that can work with problems 3D printers have so experience is going to be your only help.  I know in Inventor you can go around and Thicken/Offset individual surfaces of the model to compensate or if you had a percentage for your shrinkage you could get creative with formulas in the sketches.\n", "Understand and developing firmware": "\nAs far as I know, Marlin - assuming that is the firmware you are using - is a standard C++ (the big brother of C) project that can be opened and compiled in the Arduino IDE, but also - at least - edited lots of other IDEs. \nDepending on your OS, there are several alternatives. Visual Studio, Atmel Studio, Qt Creator, XCode, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text and the Arduino IDE are just some of them.\nI also believe that this question should be moved to StackOverflow. However, if you have questions as to how you can make specific modification to Marlin, this forum is the right place to ask. If that is the case, consider reformulating your question!\n", "Installing E3D v6 extruder electronics on Ultimaker Original+": "\nI'm not certain exactly what you're asking, but I'll give this a try. If I've misunderstood, please give more details.\nIt sounds like you're upgrading to the E3D v6. If so, the heater, thermistor, and fans should connect to the same places as the previous ones did. The exception would be if you had thermocouples instead of thermistors before; that's a more complicated change.\nIf the connectors are different, you'll need to get matching connectors from a parts supplier (post a picture if you're having trouble identifying them). Fortunately each of the items you mentioned has 2 wires, and for the heater and thermistor polarity doesn't matter. \nFor fans, polarity does matter, so match up red vs. black, or just try it one way, and if the fan doesn't turn, then swap the wires.

As the saying goes, a level bed is next to godliness or something like that. Pay extra attention to the direction the nozzles are offset by (if one nozzle is offset on the X-axis, pay extra attention to the bed leveling along the X-axis). This can be done with just one nozzle and a business card or piece of paper.\nUse a bubble level to get the nozzles about right. Move your z-axis up a bit and put a bubble level against the nozzles. Adjust as necessary so it's exactly level. The nozzles should be level enough that the bubble stays in the middle.\nFine-tune it with a business card. When you home the z- axis, you should be able to just fit a business card under both nozzles with a moderate amount of resistance. Don't force the card. If sliding the business card under produces a different amount of resistance for one nozzle than for another, adjust the nozzle a tiny amount. You can also use an index card or playing card.\nOnce it passes the card test, try a test print. If it doesn't work, make sure your bed is level, your nozzle offset is correct in the slicing software, and try calibrating with an index card again. If the nozzles become way off, try the bubble level again.\n\nAs for physically adjusting the level, another answer suggests shims made from aluminum foil, which work well. Personally, my extruder was off-level by almost exactly 1mm, so a pair of washers worked nicely for that.\nHappy printing!\nLeveling with a bubble:\n\n", "print preparation - Comparative design methods for joints that will be joined together": "\nOne of my favorite techniques is to join pieces with screws, and include a tapered feature that helps align the parts.

The pin assignments vary from one part to another, but you can probably find them from the part number online. Some parts have the ground pin also connected to a metal part of their case. The green wire from the board should be ground (no promises!)\nAssuming you've got a voltmeter, you can use it to find out which pins on the board are power and ground (easiest to do before the regulator is installed...). Then once installed, check that you're really getting 5V versus ground on the remaining (output) pin.\nSince 2 of these burned out on you, I suggest taking steps to reduce the strain on the regulator. Voltage regulators turn the excess power into heat. Some things that can help:\n\nUse heat sink grease to conduct heat from the regulator to the circuit board, the adjacent socket, etc. Hot melt glue, as the instructions you linked to mention, won't likely provide as much heat conduction.\nAttach a heat sink to the regulator, or a bigger heat sink.\nGet more air blowing across the regulator. You could do this by moving the regulator slightly, adding a fan, adding something to redirect some air onto the regulator, etc.\nSwap in a bigger voltage regulator (that is, one rated for more current)\nTurn down the voltage just a tiny bit on your power supply (if it has a control for that; many do).\n\nLet us know how it turns out!\nSteve\n", "makerbot - Updating firmware on Monoprice Architect printer": "\nThe Monoprice Architect is is a bare-bones FlashForge Creator that has been re-badged for Monoprice. The Creator line is a very popular set of printers, so there is lots of good advice out there. The FlashForge Google Group is a good community to join: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flashforge\nThe entire FF Creator line, in turn, is cloned from the original Makerbot Replicator 1. So you can use Makerbot slicing profiles for the Replicator 1. Just keep in mind that Makerbot does not generally test new software revs with their older printers, and DEFINITELY does not test new software revs with competitor knock-offs. Sometimes they appear to break functionality for non-Makerbot machines on purpose. So recent versions of Makerbot Desktop may not \"play nice\" with your FlashForge. The most recent \"known good\" free slicer you should use with this printer is Makerware 2.4.x. You can find links by searching the FF Google Group.\nOn that note, you may have received instructions to use ReplicatorG with your printer. But RepG is abandonware: development stopped years ago. It should only be used for firmware updates, not as a slicer. You should also only use the most recent version posted on the Sailfish page on Thingiverse: \nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32084\nUsing older versions of RepG with newer firmware revs will corrupt your EEPROM! Only use the version downloaded from the link above. \nThe firmware that comes with the printer is FlashForge's slightly-customized build of either Sailfish or Makerbot's Replicator 1/2/2x firmware. But here's the trick: Makerbot's Rep1/2/2x firmware is just an old, out-of-date, slightly customized version of Sailfish. Makerbot stopped keeping up with bug-fixes and feature additions a long time ago. Everything is Sailfish: just different versions. You should use the most recent official release version listed at:\nhttp://www.sailfishfirmware.com/\nFollow the instructions in the Sailfish manual from the link above, and RepG will automatically pull the right builds from the official mirror and populate a list of printer options to choose. The trick here is which build to download. As of 1-21-16, there is not an official Monoprice Architect build yet. Which would mean editing a machine xml profile to avoid the firmware throwing warnings. I STRONGLY recommend getting used to the printer using factory firmware before trying to fight with custom machine profiles... But here is the basic process to pick a Sailfish firmware build when you're ready:\nFirst: which Atmega processor version do you have? The large chip in the middle of the control board will either say 1280 or 2560. You need to know which version you have. Bad things happen if you load the wrong version.\nSecond: What is the tooth count on the X and Y drivetrain pulleys? To my knowledge, FF always uses 17-tooth pulleys, which matches the Replicator 1 and FF Creator profiles. The Rep2 and 2x use 18t pulleys, so only use those builds if you have those pulleys. People often mess this up and their prints end up with dimensions ~5% off in X and Y. \nThird: The Architect has one extruder and no heatbed, so firmware builds that expect those to be connected (Rep 1 Dual, Creator, etc) will throw errors if loaded. You can fix this from the LCD screen or RepG, but that's a whole separate question. Do some printing and learn about the printer before attempting any firmware update so you'll know what to do if you pick a build with the wrong parts. \nFourth: This one is just for the sake of completeness. Some FF models were shipped with off-spec heatbeds that require special firmware builds to prevent drawing too much current and overheating / overloading the power supply. The Architect doesn't have that, but firmware builds for those printer models (eg I believe the FF Creator 2560) will under-power regular heatbeds. This is just something you need to know with the Architect if you decide to install a heatbed later. But it's a really critical safety warning for people with those off-spec heatbeds. \nIf this all seems complicated, that's because FlashForge (and in turn Monoprice) relies heavily on the open source Sailfish project to maintain the software ecosystem behind this line of printers. FlashForge has some internal builds that they use for flashing new bots, but these are not kept particularly up-to-date. Nor does FlashForge release the source files, so it's quite opaque where exactly the stock firmware differs from mainstream Sailfish. In the long run, you should install mainline Sailfish. But it's ok to stick with the factory firmware until you get used to the printer. \nTo summarize: Because there is not an existing Sailfish build, you're going to need to do some investigating and some experimenting to figure out which build will work. Don't try that until you're familiar with the printer. Post on the FlashForge Google Group when you're ready for help.\n", "software - Cura with Pronterface UI stops printing": "\nA problem I have come across when using Pronterface is that the operating system starves the resources of the program if the program's window is not in the front.\nIf I, for instance, started a print, then started browsing the web, it would sometimes suddenly stop. When bringing Pronterface back to the front, it would take a few seconds, and then continue (if I remember correctly).\nOn OS X - which I am using - I believe this is called app nap, while a similar mechanism exist for Windows. I ended up printing form an SD card myself after this, but you might want to try manually setting the resource priority for Pronterface in your OS.\nIn Windows, you could trying to increase the resource allocation for Pronterface by going to Task Manager -> Details -> Right click the Pronterface process -> Set Priority. I would be careful to set it too high, since you are basically allowing the program more juice to potentially do something wrong.\nIn OS X you could try to disable app nap for Pronterface.\n", "software - How can I set the position in Pronterface?": "\n\nG92 X0 Y0 Z0\n\ntells the printer that the current position is (0,0,0).\n", "electronics - Is this fuse a good choice for my Prusa i3's power supply and RAMPS 1.4?": "\nNo, do not use this fuse. The current rating is too high to be reasonable for your printer. It will \"work\" in the sense that your printer will get power, but it won't provide anywhere near as much protection as a lower-rated fuse. \n10A is a lot of current for mains voltage. Depending on what else you have plugged in, there is a fair chance your home's 15A breaker will trip before this fuse does, which kind of defeats the point of having it. \nEven for \"fast\" fuses, it takes a significant amount of time for them to blow when conducting their rated current. The internal fusible link has to heat up and melt before the fuse stops conducting. The less the overload current exceeds the rating, the longer that takes. A 10A fuse conducting a 10.5A short might take 30 seconds to trip. In the meantime, your printer is melting. Lower-rated fuses will trip faster for the same short and thus provide better protection. \nYou need to size fuses as small as possible for the required current draw if you want to have any hope of rapidly cutting off an excessive-current event.\nI would recommend a 4A fuse in the USA for this 350w power supply. (Note: the listing title says 360 but the photos show 350.) I use 4A fuses in several printers with 120v / 350w PSUs and they do not trip. But you can do the math for yourself:\n350 watts / 120 volts / 80% efficiency = 3.64A\nThe smallest fuse you can find that is larger than this value is what you should use. \nNow, we can argue over whether 80% is the right efficiency value... it could be lower. The PSU label says 6.5A input is required, but that amount of current draw implies either a <50% efficiency (which is quite poor for this kind of PSU) or would only occur for abuse/surge scenarios like starting very large motors. Such short-lived inrush events generally won't trip a fuse unless you do something dumb like lock the rotor. And none of that applies to the small microstepping-driver stepper motor systems we're working with here. This PSU should not draw more than 4A in normal 3D printer use.\nLooking at this on the other end -- how much damage will 10A do versus 4A? Lots. If the short is in the 12v system, and the PSU's short protection doesn't trip in (because it's a cheap knock-off) you would roughly multiply the AC fuse current times 10 to get the DC current. And 40A is a downright scary amount of current! Depending on wire gauge, putting 40A through heatbed wiring may make it smell and smoke. Whereas putting 100A through heatbed wiring will almost certainly start a fire. \nYou're much safer with a 4A or even 6A fuse for this PSU than a 10A fuse. \n", "Which resolution is needed for bricks compatible with Lego?": "\nIt's really more about calibration than resolution -- a poorly calibrated printer will have dimension errors that prevent mating with true LEGO bricks or other printed bricks. \nAlso, \"resolution\" is an incredibly loaded term for 3d printers, because it can mean a lot of different things. But we don't need to get into that right now. There are really two big things to worry about: layer height and extrusion width.\nLayer heights of 0.1mm or 0.2mm should be fine. Coarser layers may run into surface finish issues that make the bricks difficult to put together or take apart. There probably isn't much reason to go finer than 0.1mm for this application. Almost all FFF printers can do 0.1mm layer heights as long as it is reasonably well-tuned.\nAny typical household FFF printer with a \"normal\" nozzle size can print fine enough for the bricks to work. It just needs to be tuned well. The smallest \"must have\" feature in a standard lego brick is the 1.6mm thick wall around the sides. The typical minimum printable feature size for an FFF printer is 2x the extrusion width, because the slicer will place a path on the inside edge of the shape and the outside edge of the shape. (Some slicers will allow single-extrusion features, but this is not generally recommended because it makes weak parts.) \nSo, how wide is the extrusion width? It's adjustable, and different slicers auto-recommend different values, but as a safe rule of thumb it needs to be between 1x and 2x your nozzle size. There are some volume calculation quirks in different slicers that may encourage larger or smaller sizes, so sometimes people recommend [extrusion width = nozzle size + layer height] particularly with Slic3r. This is very system-specific. \nAssuming you have the most common stock nozzle with a 0.4mm orifice, and also set the extrusion width to 0.4mm, the slicer should put four strands in the walls of the LEGO brick. That's good. \nWhere it gets tricky is if you have an extrusion width that does not evenly divide into 1.6mm. Say you are printing with an extrusion width of 0.6mm. There is enough room in the wall of the part to place two full 0.6mm perimeter strands... but then a gap 0.4mm wide will be left in the center. You can't put another 0.6mm strand into that 0.4mm gap. Different slicers handle this different ways. Some will leave an empty space between the walls, and you get a very weak print. Some will mash an excessive amount of plastic into the gap, causing poor print quality as excess material builds up more and more on each layer. Some will push a smaller-than-commanded strand to try to properly fill the volume. \nSo, the general advice with small features is to make sure your extrusion width goes into the part's minimum thickness a reasonable number of times.\n\n[Feature size / extrusion width < 2] is BAD  \n[Feature size / extrusion width = 2] is GOOD \n[2 < Feature size / extrusion width < 3] is BAD \n[Feature size / extrusion width > 3] is GOOD\n\nAlthough these will vary somewhat by slicer -- older slicers like Skeinforge tend to have more issues with this than newer slicers. What you should do in practice is check your slicer's print previewer to see whether it is leaving a gap between the strands. Then adjust extrusion width and perimeter/shell count to try to get an intelligent output. There's some trial and error involved.\n", "material - Advantages of PETG filament?": "\nPETG is great stuff to work with. It is stronger than ABS also. It prints slower than ABS and PLA. The formulas vary quite a bit from vendor to vendor. I have used 3 brands, and each of their properties vary. \nFrom my experience you do have to be careful with moisture. You'll be able to tell you have moisture in your filament if you start hearing a slight hissing and popping and an increased number of structural zits on the object. Moisture will also increase the problem listed in Mark's post below regarding the accumulation of filament on the nozzle.\n", "Why is CLIP so much faster than SLA?": "\nIt's important to understand what specifically is being compared. CLIP is much faster than bottom-up technologies that require a peel step between every layer. For example, the Form1 galvo SLA printer tilts the resin vat to separate the transparent bottom from the print. That is, by far, the slowest part of SLA/DLP printing with most modern light sources. Where the speed comes in is that without a peel, a continuous \"movie\" can be used to cure the resin rather than a series of alternating images and peels. \nTop-down printers can print dramatically faster than bottom-up-and-peel printers. CLIP is not necessarily faster than top-down. For example, the Gizmo 3D line of top-down printers are very similar in print speed to CLIP. (http://www.gizmo3dprinters.com.au/)\nMost \"consumer\" SLA printers these days use bottom-up-and-peel techniques, because this has some practical advantages over top-down printers:\n\nWay less resin is required to fill the printer when the part is pulled out as it builds rather than being lowered into the tank (along with the Z stage) as it builds. Resin is expensive. This also means bottom up printers can be smaller and have fewer mechanical parts such as leveling devices submerged in resin. \nStandard resins contain an inhibitor chemical that prevents polymerization in the presence of oxygen, which causes the surface layer exposed to air (and low-level stray light) to not cure. So top-down printers must shoot light through a non-curing layer before reaching curable resin. This makes the tuning more sensitive and can somewhat reduce detail compared to a bottom-up printer curing right on the window.\nReplacement vats or windows for bottom-up printers may be seen by manufacturers as a profit-generating consumable, since they have to be replaced somewhat frequently.\nTop-down printers have to worry somewhat more about resin flow rates as the part is lowered. Air bubbles may be pulled into the resin or the fresh resin layer above the part may vary significantly in thickness if the part is submerged too fast for the resin viscosity. (Admittedly, bottom-up printers will experience excessive suction forces and potentially break off bits of the print at high peel speeds.)\n\nCLIP is a bottom-up technique that doesn't require a peel step, because the vat creates an oxygen layer over the window that keeps the resin from curing directly on the surface and sticking. In that way, it arguably performs more like a top-down printer than a bottom-up printer. \nTop-down printers that are designed to overcome the above issues and use high-intensity light sources can achieve exceptionally high print speeds. This includes similar \"continuous\" build techniques used as in CLIP.\n", "How to edit Cura profile in Octoprint?": "\nAs far as I know, this is currently not possible.\n", "maintenance - How to identify nozzle wear": "\nI believe the little experiment made by E3D - the same link you provide - answers your question very well. Several points about wear can be found in this article. After printing only 250 grams of ColorFabb XT-CF20 (carbon fiber filament):\n\nThe nozzle diameter had increased markedly\nThe inner walls of the orifice (opening) showed deep sharp ridges and grooves\nThe tip of the nozzle had become critically rounded, and shortened\n\nAll of these symptoms were found repeatedly for standard brass nozzles.\nIn particular, I believe the last of these symptoms may be the one most easily identifiable without accurate measuring equipment (and without observing print quality).\nWith regards to reduction in print quality, these symptoms could be simulated by:\n\nSetting the nozzle diameter too big in your slicer\nLeveling your bed too high (the rounded tip will also reduce the length of the tip)\nPrinting with a partial clog that interruptus normal filament flow (due to the grooves and ridges)\n\nExactly what this will look like on your printed part is hard to predict, but I would assume you could see blobs, under-extrusion, poor layer adhesion, as well as an irregular surface finish of your top layers.\n", "abs - Maintaining fine details while applying smoothing methods": "\nA technique I've used in the past is to make a acetone slurry of the same filament used to print your object, and carefully paint the details you need to smooth.  You must be careful and only do a very thin coat or you may damage your print. You can add extra coat if needed to make sure the acetone has evaporatored from the previous coat of ABS filaments slurry.\n", "post processing - Drilling 3D-printed plastic": "\nHave to get this out of the way... Can you just print the hole into the part instead of drilling? That's usually best, when possible. \nIf you need to drill, you'll definitely want to print an undersized hole and then ream it out with the drill. This both provides alignment for the drill and adds extra plastic around the region you'll be weakening. If you don't know where the hole needs to go in advance, fill the model with a hex pattern of tiny holes in the general region of the future drilling. This is an easy way to strengthen the area with more plastic without making the entire part solid. (Using a slicer that allows localized print settings will also work.)\nThe hole should be aligned more or less vertical or \"across the grain\" (+/-45 degrees aligned with the Z axis) to ensure there are nice, strong hoops of plastic around the hole to keep it from splitting. Drilling into a printed part (particularly PLA) from the side / parallel to the XY plane is highly likely to split it. It may even be ok at first but crack later under load or due to creep. \nRegular wood drill bits work ok, but you need to go slow and take nibbles, leaving the plastic time to cool so it doesn't melt and stick to the bit. (Coolant is an option.) Use a pilot hole, piloted bit, or step drill to remove less plastic per pass. A really sharp bit will perform dramatically better than a dull bit. \nPut something hard and drillable like wood behind the plastic part to help avoid breakage and bit-jamming when you break through the opposite side. \n", "maintenance - Filament extrudes at an angle": "\nI've personally had this happen when I had a minor clog in my nozzle. \nMy first steps to fix this would be:\n\nMake sure the exterior of your nozzle is clean. I've had bits of plastic pull at the extruding filament and change it's direction.\nAttempt a \"cold pull\" or \"atomic pull\". On my Replicator 2 I do this by removing the extruder motor, heating up the hot end, manually pushing a length of filament through the nozzle, letting it cool slightly and tugging the filament (and hopefully the clog) out of the nozzle.\n\n", "recycling - Making your own filament": "\n\nQuality depends on 3 things:\n\nQuality of pellets (purity, fillers, color)\nWhere/how they are stored before and during the extrusion (humidity, contaminants)\nHave a filter in your extruder to get rid of random junk and air bubbles ending up in your filament (250 micron wire mesh filter)\n\n\nThere's no secret formula the filament producing companies have, they just have very efficient and very fast filament producing machines (of course very expensive, too). But when it comes to vanilla ABS or PLA, it's almost the same content.\n\nPersonal experience: no. If you get the same pellets, store it in the same place and run your extruder in the same place, it should behave the same.\nI don't think there is some filament mixture you won't be able to find anywhere, but you might be able to make it yourself cheaper. Example: mixing strontium aluminate powder for glow in the dark filament (come in many colors, not just green).\n\nI'd recommend this design: http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-your-own-3d-printing-filament-factory-Filame/\nIt produces filament pretty fast (one full 1kg spoon in 3-4 hours). Just make sure you have enough experience to not electrocute yourself while assembling this as the heaters use mains power.\nI personally think the commercial \"hobby\" extruders are not worth the money. I also own the Filastruder and it's just no different and slower than the above, unless you care about a pretty plywood case for your extruder I see no advantage and since it uses off-the-shelf parts itself why bother buying a kit like that than sourcing the parts yourself?\n", "Taking a new hotend into operation (cleaning, forming, etc)": "\nI haven't done anything special to set up mine. But it's probably worth doing a general cleaning. I'd swab it off with alcohol, including running a q-tip or similar inside the fiber feed path. Then blow out the nozzle with compressed air to make sure it's clear.\nYou could measure the nozzle diameter by fitting fine drill bits in to see which is the largest one the passes through freely. Be sure to measure how much fiber your extruder really takes in when you ask it to extrude a certain length -- but that's about the extruder, not the hotend per se.\nFinally, I'd check the insulation, if any. I got a couple hot ends that had big gaps in/around the insulation. I've found that \"high-temperature gasket maker\" is great for improving insulation (depends, of course, on the shape and design of the specific hot end.\n", "wiring - In the standard PC Cable Wire that goes from the wall outlet to the switching power supply, are they standard and what are the wire specifications?": "\nVery basically speaking, electricity works like this:\n\nThere's some source that delivers a certain voltage.\nYou have a device that operates at a certain voltage. The device voltage and supply voltage should always match. No, don't put that 120V US device in a 230V outlet in Europe.\nThe device does something. By doing something it draws current. Most devices also draw some current when not doing anything.\nHow much power your device draws is the product of these two values:voltage x current = power \n\nSo far, so good. In your case:\n\n\nUS AC outlet.\n\nthe voltage is 120V.\nOn this other question of yours you linked to this power\nsupply on amazon. Besides being available gift-wrapped, it\nstates the following feature:\n\nYou can choose the input voltage (110V/240V) by switch.\n\n110V \u2248 120V, which means the device voltage matches your supply\nvoltage.\nThe supply can deliver 30A at 12V on the DC side which means 360W.\nIf it could transform the electricity ideally, without any\ninefficiency, that would be 3A at 120V on the AC side. But your\nsupply is unlikely ideal. Wikipedia suggests 60-95% efficiency.\nLet's be super pessimistic and assume 50%. That means half the power\nthat goes into the switch power supply is turned into heat. In order\nto still get the 360W out, you have to insert 720W. That means\nyour device draws 6A on the AC side.\n\nWhat does this all mean for your wire?\nWhat wire size do you need for this supply?\nCoincidentally, the above link to the amazon website showing your power supply also suggests the following PC ATX power supplies to me:\n\nSentey Power Supply 725 Watt\nSentey Power Supply 1000 Watt\n\nLet's get this straight: You can buy a power supply for a PC and plug it into your outlet without even thinking about what a wire size is. You'd just plug and play. That PC power supply will potentially draw more current than the power supply of your 3D printer. A standard wire would be able to supply either one of the PC ATX power supplies linked above and would not have a problem delivering a lower current to the power supply of your 3D printer.\nThe switching supply doesn't have a plug like a PC ATX supply, but that on its own doesn't make it any less secure (if wired up properly). It's just less common for household appliances.\n\nUltimately, I'd like to avoid a fire, or damage to the house wiring.\n\nThat's a good and valid concern. \nPC Power supplies deliver 12V and supply more than enough current (like the examples above). They are probably in use in your house already and did neither set it on fire nor damage the house wiring.\nA switching mode power supply is just as secure and if bought from a known brand unlikely to do you any harm either if used properly and within its specifications.\nUltimately, this is not a question of secure electricity but a trade-off between secure electricity and the price to pay for it. The standard wire and it's specifications have little to do with this.\n\nPersonally, I also use a cheap switching power supply made in china for my printer. It's very noisy and I pull the plug when I leave it unattended.\n", "prusa i3 rework - When building a RAMPS 1.4 based printer, can I safely plugin just some of the components to test if they are working?": "\nIf by components you mean motors, fans, or heated bed, then yes. This is even suggested in the Final Setup instructions on the RAMPS wiki.\n\nIf you think you may have mistakes (in your setup) you can install only one stepper driver during initial testing and risk only one stepper driver.\n\nThere are also printers using RAMPS with no heated bed and other machines that have no extruder at all. Furthermore, from an electronics perspective: if nothing is connected across a terminal no current will flow and therefore there is no damage that can be done. Obviously if you short out the unused connections there will be problems.\n", "filament - Can general purpose polystryene (not HIPS) be used for 3D printing?": "\nIn principle, it should work fine as a filament, since it's used extensively in the plastic extrusion industry, but I don't think you'd get great material properties out of it. ABS and HIPS incorporate polybutadiene into a graft polymer structure for a very good reason: the butadiene sections in the long molecular chains kind of \"stick together\" as a distinct solid phase to produce what amounts to micro-bubbles of rubber inside a matrix of hard styrene or acrylonitrile-styrene plastic. This compound microstructure is what gives HIPS and ABS favorable impact toughness and some minor flexibility.\nThe flexibility is important -- the stiffer a filament is, the more it will tend to warp while printing. Based on chemistry alone, I would expect styrene to be somewhat more prone to warping than ABS. And it would certainly be more brittle. So there doesn't seem to be much reason to use it as filament.\nInteresting sidenote: PLA/PHA has very favorable mechanical properties because the PHA forms a very similar flexible microstructure inside the hard PLA matrix. PLA/PHA is good stuff because it mimics ABS and HIPS!\n", "How to use a multimeter to test how many amps RAMPS is pulling?": "\nTo measure amps (current), the meter has to be wired in series with the item to be measured (for this reason, ammeters are designed to have very low resistance). \nThis has the down-side that you have to disconnect the component to put the meter in line with it. That makes it hard to do the \"check a component at a time\" method you mentioned.\nAn ammeter measures actual current flow, so you really can't test a component for it in isolation. Components can have wildly different \"current draw\" depending on the situation. For example, motor current varies with torque and speed; current through a resistor varies with the voltage across it; and so on.\nThere are special \"clamp-on\" current meters that just clamp around a conductor and report the current by using induction. Very nice if you have one.\nIf you just want the total current the entire RAMPS board is pulling, put the ammeter between the power supply and the RAMPS power input connection(s). Be very sure not to have the meter set to read volts or ohms when you do this (it might or might not survive).\n", "ramps 1.4 - How do I wire the z-axis motors in parallel on the Prusa i3?": "\nIn the diagram, they do show the wires connecting together, which is right. You can accomplish that just about any way you like, so long as you pair up the wires correctly from one motor to the other.\nI'm assuming both \"Z\" motors are the same type and have the same color-coding for their wires. If not, you'll need to figure out the correspondences first (you may want to post another question if you need a hand with that, since it's pretty specific and generally useful).\nMany control boards have \"headers\" sticking up, with 4 bare pins for each motor. Connectors that plug right onto those are readily available, such as at https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10364.\nSome ways you can wire the motors in parallel:\n\nSome control boards, like my RAMPS 1.4, provide 2 sets of header pins next to the Z stepper driver board. In that case, just put a connector on each motor (if they're not there already), and plug them in next to each other.\nIf there's just one set of header pins (or one Z-motor socket of some other kind) on your controller, make a \"Y-cord\" by soldering the wires from one connector (that plugs to the controller) to 2 4 pin connectors, one to mate with each motor.\nOr you can skip the 2 extra connectors entirely, and just solder the motor wires to the wires from the connector: 2 reds to red, 2 blacks to black, or whatever.\nIf your controller just has empty holes, either solder in header pins and do as above (preferred, IMHO), or wire directly into the holes, splicing the 2 sets of motor wires if there's only one set of holes.\n\nMotor and connector wires are wildly inconsistent, so make sure you get them sorted out right if they aren't already. The first thing is to check continuity: find 2 pairs of wires, which are the ends of two separate coils. If your motors have more than 4 wires it's trickier.\nWith RAMPS (see handy diagram RAMPS 1.4 RepRap Arduino Mega Pololu shield), \n\nthe 4 pins are commonly labelled (starting from the one nearest the power-supply end of the RAMPS board):\n2B 2A 1A 1B\n\nIt means coil 1 and coil 2, each of which has ends A and B. I find this unclear because it could just as well have been numbers for the coils, and letters for the ends (if you wire it that way it won't work). So be sure you have continuity (maybe 15 ohms or so) between the wires you connect to 2B and 2A, and between the wires you connect to 1A and 1B.\nThe really good thing about this pin order is that if a motor is running backwards all you have to do is power off and then turn the plug around. That's one reason I think it's important to keep connectors in there, rather than soldering directly.\n", "printer building - What are the pros and cons of collecting parts yourself, versus getting a DIY kit and then modifying it?": "\nFrom a general point of view, there are a few things to consider.\nIf you buy a kit:\nPros:\n\nYou get some insurance that you have all the parts that you need to get a functional printer - all the electronics, structure, bolts, nuts, screws, washers, wires and so on.\nMost likely, all the parts you get are made to fit together.\nYou will (usually) get a manual, often a community that can help you out, and sometimes even technical support.\nSometimes, it can be cheaper than buying each part separately (but it can also be more expensive)\n\nCons:\n\nYou have limited/no options to customize your printer to your own preferences without purchasing additional parts. \nSome kits can be difficult to upgrade later or may be locked to some configuration or software.\n\nMy opinion:\nThe way I look at it, the better option for you depends on how you want to spend your time. That is:\n\nIf you get a kit, you can spend more time building.\nIf you collect all the parts yourself, you will have to spend time planning, ordering parts (possibly multiple times) in addition to actually building the printer. A possible lack of manuals could also increase the building difficulty.\n\nIf you don't already own a 3D printer, I would recommend getting a kit, simply because struggling with trivial things like parts not fitting together can take away the fun for many people.\n", "How to choose a right 3D printer filament type?": "\n\nDetermine what properties you need the filament to have.\nThere are a very wide variety of filaments because they all have somewhat different properties.  You need to determine what properties you need your final print to possess.  For instance, ABS can be smoothed used acetone and PLA is biodegradable. More exotic filaments could be conductive or be extremely flexible. Do not neglect to consider safety of the plastic in your application. A full list of properties is too broad for an appropriate answer from this site.\n\nDetermine what you printer is designed to handle.\nMost printers can handle PLA and ABS with little issue but higher temperatures are required to use some materials such as nylon and polycarbonate.  Determine beforehand what your printer is designed to handle.  This includes determining whether you have and appropriate heated bed or other accessories.\n\nDetermine what you can afford.\nPrinting not only requires the cost of the weight of filament in the final print but all of the support structures and misprints you produce. Not only should you look for inexpensive filaments, but you should look for ones that are good enough quality you don't waste time and money fighting problems with the raw material.\n\n\nAll in all, this will vary case by case.  I would recommend that you start with PLA or ABS as they are common and relatively easy to work with but that you do your own research into what each individual filament type has to offer..\n", "post processing - Methods for smoothing 3D objects": "\nAbrasive blasting is the only other method I can think of which you haven't said you don't want to try.\nIt is certainly the easiest method provided you have access to one. \nDifferent forms of abrasive blasting include:\n\nshot blasting (metal shot) - I suspect it would be far to abrasive but I've never tried it.\nsandblasting - you have to be careful but this is basically sandpaper attached to a wand.

There are 2 main methods of rapid prototyping: additive, and subtractive.\nA 3D printer is additive- you add materials to an object layer by layer.\nUsually, when people talk about a subtractive machine, they are talking about a CNC mill (or lathe), which tend to be extremely large (most are over one ton). You start with all the material there, and you subtract the material that you don't want. This might be what you are thinking of.\n", "software - What are some good FOSS or free tools for editing STL files for 3D Printing?": "\nYou can use OpenSCAD. It's a script based powerful CAD open source software under GPL. \nOn Thingiverse, a lot of things are made with this CAD software (the Customizer flagged ones) and you can just download their source code (.scad) and directly edit them !\nYou can also import existing STL and edit them like they were a primitive shape like a cube. You can then interact with them by doing binary operations, adding parts, etc. \nIt is hard to start with if you have never coded, but that's worth it :\n\nOpenSCAD is a software for creating solid 3D CAD models. It is free software and available for Linux/UNIX, Windows and Mac OS X. Unlike most free software for creating 3D models (such as Blender) it does not focus on the artistic aspects of 3D modelling but instead on the CAD aspects. Thus it might be the application you are looking for when you are planning to create 3D models of machine parts but pretty sure is not what you are looking for when you are more interested in creating computer-animated movies.\n\n", "hatd bd - Brokn Print Bd - 3D Printing Stack Exchang": "\nA little chip is fine, but I wouldn't print with that big of a crack. However, that doesn't mean you need to spend $80 on a new sheet of glass.\nOption #1- If you want borosilicate glass, you can get a sheet from either McMaster (about $40+shipping for a 10\"x10\" piece, less for smaller) or from a local glass maker (the price varies a lot, so you should check that also if you want to go that route). However, you won't be able to drill holes (tempered glass will break of you drill a hole). Borosilicate glass has the advantage of being extremely heat-resistant, so it won't break from thermal expansion. If you go this route, you should pick up a few binder clips also to attach the sheet to the heated bed.\nOption #2- You might be able to get picture frame glass from a hardware store. It's super cheap (mine was $3 or something from lowes) and they'll often cut it to exact size. You might be able to drill this, but you have to be extremely careful. Sometimes, the hardware store can drill holes in the sheet for you if needed. If you don't want to drill, a few binder clips will work just as well.\nJust a note for if you are using binder clips: you might need to (depending on how your hbp is set up) get a piece of glass that is slightly smaller to allow for any bed leveling screws to have room. If you're going with the picture frame glass, you should make sure that the glass will be entirely within the heated part so that there isn't any heat gradient (that's how glass cracks/shatters). \n", "software - How to configure Cura to run the Z probe before heating": "\nIn Cura (and Slic3r), you can 100% customize what the printer does before printing your actual model through custom start/end g-code.\nIf you navigate to the Start/End-GCode tab in Cura, then select start.gcode, you can see what operations are run before each print begins. Lines prefixed with ; are comments, and does not affect the printing in any way. \nBasically, we want to manually tell the printer to do the auto leveling before heating up the nozzle by editing the g-code in start.gcode.\nG-Code generated with the default start.gcode:\nIf you try to slice some model with the default code found in start.gcode, you will get something like the following (depending on your printer):\n; CURA AUTOMATICALLY INSERTS THESE TEMPERATURE CODES\n\nM190 S70.000000 ; Set bed temperature to 70 degrees\nM109 S210.000000 ; Set nozzle temperature to 210 degrees\n\n\n; THESE ARE THE CODES FROM START.GCODE (for a ROBO 3D R1) \n\nG28          ;move printer to endstops (the home position)\nG92 E0       ;zero the extruded filament length\nM565 Z-1     ;set z-probe offset\nG1 Z5 F5000  ;move the printer 5mm above the bed\nG29          ;run auto-leveling\n\n\n; THE ACTUAL MODEL BEGINS HERE\n\n;Layer count: 168\n;LAYER:0\n.\n.\n\nAnalyzing the g-code output\nAt the top of this code snippet, we can see that Cura automatically inserts g-code for heating up the bed and nozzle to their respective temperatures with the M190 and M109 g-codes. This means the printer always will heat up the nozzle before reading the start.gcodes that we set. However, if we manually override M109 code in start.gcode, the M109 at the top will automagically disappear from the generated g-code output! (Thanks, @TomvanderZanden!)\nWe could therefore use the auto-leveling command G29 before manually setting the nozzle temperature with M109; specifically, we want to add M109 S{print_temperature}, which reads the Basic -> Print Temperature-setting in Cura, and replace {print_temperature} with it automatically.\nManipulating start.gcode:\nIn order to postpone heating the hotend till after probing, start.gcode could be something like: \nG28          ;move printer to endstops (the home position)\nG92 E0       ;zero the extruded filament length\nM565 Z-1     ;set z-probe offset     <-----   ( YOU HAVE TO ADJUST THIS, READ BELOW)\nG1 Z5 F5000  ;move the printer 5mm above the bed\nG29          ;run auto-leveling\nM109 S{print_temperature}    ;set nozzle temperature, and wait for it heat up\n\nAnd that's about it! You can then use these codes in your start.gcode. However, you probably will have to recalibrate your z-prove offset. \nAdjust z-probe offset:\nNormally, auto-leveling is done with the nozzle heated for a reason: when the nozzle is warm, it expands slightly, moving closer to the bed. You might therefore have to adjust your Z-probe offset with the M565 command (as demonstrated in the snippet) to account for the increase in nozzle length when warm.\nRemember:\nRemember that when editing g-code in this manner, you will take full control of how the printer operates. You could therefore very well do something unintended, so keep the power switch close! \n", "print preparation - How do people load filament, prime the printhead, flush out the old filament when changing colors when using a standalone 3D printer?": "\nMy printer (IdeaWerk 150) is very basic and doesn't have any options for this from the screen.\nI wrote a really simple GCODE file that brings the nozzle up to temperature, then runs the extruder for a few seconds, then waits, then extrudes for a bit again. I think it does this 3 or 4 times then stops. I can put the file (when converted to .x3g!) onto an SD card and run it whenever I need it.\nI have a similar file that allows me to level the bed without a computer by just moving the nozzle around to a few key points on the bed and pausing for a few seconds.\nI used a GCODE file generated by my slicer in verbose mode to get started, along with a list of codes\nI don't have these files to hand at the moment, but this is my start.gcode:\n(**** beginning of start.txt ****)\n(This file is for a WeisTek IdeaWerk 150)\n(**** begin initilization commands ****)\nG21 (Metric FTW)\nG90 (Absolute Positioning)\nM18 (This disables the stepper motors.)\n\nG92 X0 Y0 Z0 A0 B0 (Declare the current position to be 0,0,0,0,0)\n(**** end initilization commands ****)\n\n(**** begin homing ****)\nG161 Y X F2500\nG92 X0 Y0 Z0 A0 B0\nG1 X5.0 Y5.0 Z-5.0 F450\nG162 Z F450\nG161 Y X F2500 (Home X axis maximum, go until reaching the end stop.)\n\nG92 Z142.4 ( ** Set Bed Height ** )\n\nG92 X-75 Y-75 (set zero for X and Y)\n(**** end homing ****)\n\nM108 R8.0 (Extruder speed = max)\nM6 T0 (wait for toolhead parts, nozzle, HBP, etc., to reach temperature)\n\nG1 Z10 F500 (Bring bed up)\n\nM101 (Turn on Extruder)\nG04 P8000 (Wait for 8 seconds for flow)\n(**** end of start.txt ****)\n\nIf I feed just this file into my printer, it will heat up the nozzle, bring the bed up to about 10cm below printing height and once the nozzle is at temperature, it turns on the extruder for 8 seconds.\nYour printer will likely be different to mine - there are a few different flavours of GCODE and you will likely have different XYZ positions, so take a look at some GCODE generated by your own slicer and identify the different parts. The principle is the same.\n", "hotend - Is it necessary to have both hot ends on a dual extruder printer at the same height?": "\nI have a dual extruder Replicator 1 and having the nozzles at the same height is a must and albeit a bit of a struggle otherwise. At one point, I had to disassemble my extruder head and the nozzles didn't line up quite right. There after, printing with the lower one obviously didn't have any troubles, however, printing with the high extruder made it so the lower extruder would scrape the molten plastic layer. This made my surface finish horrible and almost impossible for support structures to be printed.\nInstead of fighting with my stock nozzle assembly to get everything perfectly lined up, I just shimmed the one side with some stacks of paper cutouts. This brought my extruders very close to even.\nAlso, you'll want to make sure excess plastic is cleaned off of BOTH nozzles when printing with either nozzle. I found that some prints would fail because of a small discharge from a previous print on the other nozzle.\n", "Printing multiple materials with different properties on the same device": "\nYes and no.\n\nfor instance simultanious printing of plas plastic and lets say metal. Is such a printer available or in development ?\n\nPractically speaking, no.  Metal printing requires significantly higher temperatures than plastic, and the two processes are so incompatible that there is currently no good solutions that would allow one printer to print both in the same print. Whether extruding filament, laser sintering, or curing resins, the materials involved have to be fairly similar in processing environment to print adjacent to each other without issue.\nThere are many printers that are intended to print multiple materials by changing the print head.  You might, for instance, use a ceramic paste extruder, then change the head for the next print using plastic.\nThere have been efforts in the past, and some efforts are ongoing, to resolve this.  For instance wood's metal, a low temperature alloy, can be poured at temperatures compatible with plastics, so it's possible to create a printer that prints plastic, leaving troughs or voids in the plastic, then the same printer during this print would pour molten woods metal into these areas, which then solidifies into an internal metal structure.  These are intended for circuitry and electrical use, however significant problems still exist because the thermal expansion differences in these materials lead to stress and result in poor reliability.\nSo while some of these processes are being developed, this is still just in the experimental stage and there are significant problems to overcome before printers can print widely different materials in a single printing session.\nOf course you can find plastics with such a wide range of characteristics that they can be seen as printing different materials.  Plastics imbued with wood fibers, printing next to conductive plastics with graphite, printing next to flexible plastics, etc, etc are now possible, and depending on your requirements they may meet your needs.\n", "print preparation - Bed leveling method?": "\nThere are several ways.\n1) Simplest is the business card/paper method.\nThis video shows how simple it is: Leveling the platform\nYou should feel the same amount of resistance between the hotend and the bed on all sides. On some 3D printers there are 3 screws holding the bed (eg. Solidoodle) and on others there are 4 screws on each edge (e.g. Prusa i3).\nOn some 3D printers you need to rotate a screw with a screwdriver to adjust it (e.g. Solidoodle 3) and on some you have a nut (mostly wing nut) (e.g. Solidoodle 4).\nI find most people move the extruder around when adjusting the bed by controlling the motors. I think the quicker way is stopping the motors (in Repetier Host it's the \"Stop Motor\" button) and moving the gantry by hand.\nTutorial: 3D printing guides - Bed leveling\n2) Second one is just more advanced version of the above. You use a dial indicator/ micrometer attached to your extruder and make sure the number on the dial is as close as possible on all edges.\nLevel the Print Bed on a RepRap / RepStrap 3D Printer with a Mitutoyo Dial Test Indicator\nMicrometer op 3D printer\nThere are also digital versions of this tool.\nYou might need to print or make some other way a piece to be able to attach a micrometer to the extruder (there might be one for your 3D printer on Thingiverse already).\nNow, remember I mentioned that you adjust the height of the edges of the print bed with a screw/nut? Well, since there is a lot of vibration during print those tend to get out of place and that might explain why you end up readjusting it over and over again. What I have found to solve this is to use a single drop of Loctite (cyanocrylate glue) in the middle of the nut/screw. A single drop will secure it in place but also not make it impossible to unscrew in the future.\n3) Setting up auto-bed leveling on your 3D printer if it's modable enough:\n3D printing guides: Setting up auto bed tramming leveling tilt compensation!.\nFinally, if you can't get the bed leveled no matter what, it might be uneven. That's usually caused by warping. Both PCB beds and aluminum beds can get warped. With the former just sandwich a glass bed on top of it and it should be fine. Warped aluminum is pretty hard to flatten. In this extreme situation you might need to get a new aluminum sheet cut and drilled, preferably a mm thicker one which is less likely to warp under the same conditions. I think this happens when you either set the bed temp too high and/or the thickness of the aluminum bed is too small (bad or cheap 3D printer design).\n", "fdm - What could be causing my y axis to slip?": "\n\n(source: all3dp.com)\nYour printer is skipping steps in the y-direction. This can have several causes. Take a look into Shifted layer guide on RapRap.org which lists 29 possible problems that can cause this issue and how to fix them.\nFirst items of the list:\n\nDriver current is too low\nDriver current is too high\nBelt too Loose\nBelt too Tight\nLoose Set Screw/Grub Screw\nBelt or Bearing is binding\nSpeeds are too high\nAcceleration is too high\n...\n\nWhen I was dealing with this issue on my RepRap I had to increase current to the particular driver.\n", "printer building - How to properly use Polyisocyanurate (PIR) foam with the heated bed?": "\nAn alternative solution that is used with some Kossel Mini models, is a simple cardboard covered with aluminum tape (docs).\nThis solution has the added benefit of actually improving heat-up time, since the reflective surface of the aluminum tape reflects the heat back into the bed, instead of getting absorbed. \nIt is also a very simple solution, without costly materials. I guess mounting it properly could be an issue depending on your printer, but this is a fine solution for the Kossel models, at least.\n", "heated bed - Ideal print bed: Glass or Aluminium?": "\nI believe printing directly on aluminium is unwise, simply because it will expand when heated, typically giving the bed a concave or convex shape. Glass, on the other hand, does not (at least not significantly).\nAs pointed out in the comments below, the heat expansion of aluminium could potentially be mitigated by increasing the thickness of the bed, as well as heating it evenly. Also, a common solution is to place a glass plate on top of an aluminium bed, at the cost of a slightly longer heat-up time.\nIn my experience, printing directly on heated glass can be very practical and give a nice surface finish for some PLA variants and other materials that support it. I don't know if printing directly on aluminium can give similar benefits.\n", "fdm - Will I see a noticeable difference switching from a .4mm to a .3mm nozzle?": "\n1) Smaller nozzle advantage: sharper \"corners\" (higher X and Y resolution)\n2) Larger nozzle advantage: faster 3d printing (because you can print the shell faster as each perimeter can be thicker so you'll need less perimeters to be printed to get the same shell thickness. Same true for infill).\n3) Smaller nozzle disadvantage (varies, debatable): higher risk of clogging. There are of course other factors which can result in clogging, but this can also affect it as even finer particles in less quality filament can get stuck now.\n4) Smallel nozzle disadvantage: since less plastic can come out at a given duration of time, it means less speedy printing of larger layer heights, if at all possible.\nI feel like I should get back to (1) and explain why it is so.\nWhen companies market their 3d printer they usually talk about the layer height (the Z resolution) completely ignoring the X and Y. This makes sense for marketing. Luckily it is not hard to explain what is usually left out and what is important for one of the answers to your question on what are advantages of smaller nozzles:\nThe Z resolution depends on two main things:\n1) The stepper motor driver accuracy of your 3d printer's motherboard. Pretty much all are the same now. Claiming your 3d printer can print at 20 micron layer height doesn't say anything, pretty much any 3d printed today can.\n2) Nozzle/extruder quality, nozzle diameter. The latter surprisingly does not determine much. Because of how FFF/FMD 3d printing works, the perimeters of your 3d print can be way thinner than your nozzle diameter. This might sound odd but there's a simple explanation: the molten plastic coming out of the hotend is squished and stretched when the head moves. Because it is stretched, it can be made thinner as you increase how much it is squished. There's not much experimentation done on this and available online, only from personal experience I can say I can print perimeters 50% thinner than my 3mm nozzle. So I suppose if you wanted thinner perimeters than that, you would need to swap to a thinner nozzle.\nWhy would you want thinner perimeters? To get sharper corners or in other words better X and Y resolution for your 3d prints which is ignored by most unlike the overstated \"layer height\" (Z resolution).\nHere's an illustration to help you visualize how fatter perimeters and less sharp corners/edges on your 3d model result in \"lower X/Y resolution\" (the illustration is a 2d cutout, viewed from the top):\n\n", "print quality - How thin can my extrusion be from a 1.2mm extruder?": "\nThe main issue with very narrow extrusion widths (less than the nozzle size) is that you get really poor \"nozzle squash.\" The plastic isn't pressed down very hard as it's extruded. That causes poor layer bonding and weaker prints. \nThe flow of molten plastic coming out of the nozzle must be drawn down by tension in order to end up smaller than the nozzle opening, and that drawing effect makes it difficult to get good contact with the previous layer. So you end up with a \"stack of logs\" structure kind of like this:\n\n(This photo actually shows layer height = extrusion width = nozzle size, which is another no-no, but the end result is similar.)\nWhat you want instead is something very \"mashed together\" and strong like this:\n\nHow finely the the strand can draw down -- versus smearing or breaking apart into blobs -- will depend greatly on the type of filament and the printing conditions. For example, nylon draws down extremely well because it experiences a large degree of strain crystallization, and actually gets stronger and stiffer as it's stretched. PLA tends to get more brittle when strained and may break into stringy blobs. ABS doesn't change terribly much because it's highly amorphous. Polymer type, blending agents, print speed, printing temperature, and cooling will control the drawing behavior of the filament. \nAnother factor to consider is what the strand spacing is within the print. If you set the extrusion width equal to half the nozzle width, depending on the slicer, adjacent strands may be placed with pitch equal or slightly less than half the nozzle width. So after the first strand is printed (say an unimportant inner perimeter) the next strand will be printed with the nozzle partially overlapping the previous strand. This effectively creates a constriction to force the plastic out of a smaller opening to one side of the nozzle, which is not too different from printing with a smaller nozzle. Subsequent perimeter strands may then tend to \"heal up\" even if the first is low quality. This effect doesn't completely fix the problem, but it helps account for why under-width strands seem to work better than they ought to.\nOf course, even if the strands turn out ok, it's arguable whether there is any benefit. If the goal of a smaller extrusion width is more precision and sharper corners, you may not actually accomplish that goal. When the filament is being drawn down by tension in the cooling polymer, it may tend to \"cut corners\" and get pulled into a rounded arc when the nozzle changes direction. That may defeat the point of using a thinner extrusion width in the first place. Generally I only recommend using under-width strands to capture thin-wall detail that is only a little bit too thin for the nozzle, not as a way to improve overall print quality.\nIn comparison, having the extrusion width equal or wider than the nozzle ensures the plastic is firmly squished downward into intimate contact with the lower layer. You can fudge this a bit and still get decent results, but it's usually best to keep the extrusion width equal or larger than the nozzle size. There's no hard cutoff where it will / won't work.\n", "prusa i3 rework - Why does my MKS Base not recognize my thermistors?": "\nYou should:\n\nEnsure that firmware has proper thermistor configuration.

The window is obviously a good ventilation option, but the variability that it creates in the ambient temperature screwed with my prints. Later, I moved my machine into its own hutch, which, if it is an option, would greatly help the overall environment for both the machine and any stored filament.\nWe'll keep poking around, but hopefully that helps in the mean time.\n", "What is the benefit of the Arduino shield based electronics?": "\nMany 3d printer motherboards are based on Arduino/Atmega microcontroller and just add some stepper motor drivers, MOSFETs and such in a single board. That explains why you use the Arduino IDE to update or modify their firmware.\nNow why you would want to use an Arduino + an Arduino shield board like RAMPS? Well if you're not good at electronics, are happy with the cost of your own board, don't care much about upgrades/modding beyond what is possible with your board, maybe you shouldn't, it might be overwhelming.\nThere are several advantages with using Arduino with a shield for your 3d printer, \"two boards are not just the predecessors of the one board solution\", no.\n1) It is moddable/exandable/upgradable/has replacable parts.\nIf your printer came with its own motherboard that doesn't have additional or enough pins to add more fans, enclosure lights, a second extruder, an LCD and you want to, it sucks. RAMPS can do that, it has plenty of extra pins.\nIt is upgradable. You want to replace the stepper drivers with a new one? Or you accidentally damaged the one you have? Fear not, you can just replace that instead of the whole motherboard.\nThink if it like other motherboards being PCs on which you can't change the CPU, RAM and GPU.\n2) It is here for a long time, you will be able to acquire one for a long time.\nThere isn't just one company making RAMPS or similar sheilds. Sometimes 3d printing companies go out of business or stop producing your particular motherboard. RAMPS is likely here to stay. Because Arduino is very likely here to stay.\n3) As said above, not just one company owns or makes RAMPS or other Arduino shields. Besides the possibility of your motherboard not being produced anymore, there's also the advantage of not being at the mercy of one companies pricing and shipping policies. This is true for some other boards as well though.\n4) It is possibly cheaper than what have you. I don't want to post a link, but one company right now is selling their derivative of Printrboard for like $180. Check the cost of Arduino Mega, stepper drivers and a RAMPS board yourself, quite a difference. That said, there are some boards which are close in price.\n5) It's an Arduino. Why is this a good thing by itself? Because many people who have a 3d printer are tinkerers/makers and they already use Arduino for other projects. It is open source with a rich library to control many things. The modding and upgrades for your 3d printer which can be done with Arduino is another level higher. Or it can be a good learning experience for your future Arduino projects. If on the other hand you already use Arduino and are experienced with it, you might use it just because you know how to control it/fix it better than some specialized board you haven't seen before. Plus for a guy like you your 3d printer's motherboard will be an \"off-the-shelf\" part, that's nice, right?\nVideo on RAMPS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYJn6FuWOv4\n", "print quality - What parameters affect cylinder regularity?": "\nThis is probably a result of bad quality filament. If you haven't changed much in your setups, haven't changed slicers, but may have changed spools, then this might be the result. I would try using another spool and perhaps switch suppliers. I know it's expensive and there seems to be a stigma around it, but MakerBot Industries provides quality PLA (some ABS also).\nOther than that, you've done some of what I would suggest in this case which are the following:\n\nSpeeds\nLayer height\n\nMy only other suggestions would be:\n\nCheck how level your build plate is\nCheck material requirements. ie ABS is ideal between 230-240C according to MSDS with about 110C build plate temp, PLA between 210-230C. Sometimes too hot of a hotend can result in overextrusion or ooze.\nIf the cylinder is smaller, try changing your slicing settings to have a time minimum for each layer. In my experience, a material like ABS will begin to flare out with variations in the print environment. When the material flares out, as the nozzle comes across the area again, the flared areas will be pushed aside. If you adjust your slicing settings to about 15 seconds (refer to this calculator), then the material will have time to cool slightly from its plastic state. You can cheat this slightly by adding another object somewhere further on the plate with the same height, since the time it takes to rapid to the area and print the layer might be enough time for cooling.\n\nI would also recommend doing some in depth maintenance to eliminate in obvious problems (such as cleaning your nozzle, rods, belts, etc.)\n", "ultimaker cura - What makes Pronterface wait for user?": "\nThat's the temperature problem that you've encountered.\nThe temperature of bed and hotend is reported every few seconds. Per default, first that sets is the bed temperature, then you need to wait for the bed to reach it, then warm up the hotend, and then start printing.\n", "print quality - How to improve face that are printed on support?": "\nThe basic answer to your question is to create better bridging or overhangs on your machine. Bridging is when you are printing between two solid pieces (like a bridge). Overhangs occur when printing off of a single solid piece and coming back. Most slicing engines allow extra settings for speed, fan power, etc for these parameters, just refer to this terminology.\nA very common and simple solution in getting features to 3D print properly is to just slow down! If you're not a in a rush to get the part done, you bring down all of the feedrates in your slicing engine. MakerWare has mine at 90/150 mm/s for print and rapid. Typically I'll bring that down to about 50/90. My reasoning is the more time you give the plastic to cool, both while and after printing the layer, the more rigid that layer will be for the next one. When briding or overhanging, there will typically be a sagged area in the print. You can minimize this by providing the plastic more time to cool. Also keep in mind that printing on supports is still technically bridging (printing between two solid pieces).\nAnother thing to keep in mind is adhesion from one layer to the next matter just as much between the current layer and the previous as the current strand to the one next to it. So, in some cases, increasing your shell could possibly make it easier for the infill/roof/floor strands.\n", "Is there a G-code for waiting?": "\nThe G-code to delay is G4.\nG4 P60000 will wait for one minute. The P is in milliseconds. Some firmware also accept a S Parameter that has the seconds. So, if supported, G4 S60 would do the same thing.\nThe details for this and all other G-codes are documented\nhere.\n", "fdm - Mushy small top layrs? - 3D Printing Stack Exchang": "\nLayer Times\nSee my answer to this question and pay particular attention to my suggestion about a minimum layer print time. I'm not sure if all slicing engines provide this option, but I know MakerWare/MakerBot Desktop and (possibly) Slic3r allow this setting.\nBasically, when you're extruding smaller features like this, the previous layer(s) are still very hot and possibly very pliable. So, as your nozzle moves around above the previous layer, the nozzle may (and probably will) push some of this molten plastic around. Chances are you can see it to a certain degree while it's printing. You can definitely see this in a most drastic state if you print a tall and small diameter cylinder. You'll notice that the part will become almost exponentially unstable the higher it goes.\nBy increasing the time your printer takes to print a single layer, you are allowing the previous layer(s) to cool closer to the ambient temperature of the build space, and hopefully not as molten.\nPlease refer to this calculator or a similar one for material cooling times. For a standard shell setting of about 2-3 (0.4mm nozzle) will yield about 130sec to cool down to room temperature. I would recommend (for ABS/PLA at least) about a 15second minimum for each layer, possibly longer depending on the size and spread out of the features.\nAlso note that this can be cheated by simply printing multiple items in the same build plate with the same heights (ie. multiples of the same part). Naturally, it will take longer for the machine to print the rest of the parts and therefore allow each layer to cool slightly before being printed over.\nActive Cooling\nAgain, some slicing engines have an Active Cooling setting. I don't personally have this option setup on my machine, but I believe it regulates the flow of air directed at your nozzle (usually by use of a mounted fan). This can help cool the layers a bit faster. With ABS, this might result in some pretty bad warping mid-print.\nFeedrates\nTry bringing down your feedrates to provide the printed portions of the current layer more time to cool if the above options aren't available. Note that you might also bring down your hotend temp to shorten the time it takes to cool the plastic.\nAll else fails\nMy only other suggestion is stated above, try printing duplicates on the same plate. My diagnosis is that the previous layers aren't cooling down enough before the next layer begins.\n", "What is the benefit of using an ARM based electronics?": "\n3D printer controllers have to do a lot of stuff very, very fast. Performing kinematics and dynamics calculations while sending many thousands of precisely-synchronized step pulses per second is really, really hard. The 8bit AVR line of microcontrollers used in older 3D printer controllers is basically a late-1990s era Mr Coffee processor. They are completely, utterly maxed out on processor time just executing basic printing functions in simple (eg Cartesian) printers, and adding additional calculation load will bog them down and cause slowdowns, stuttering, pausing, and so on. \n\"But my 8bit printer works fine,\" you say. No, it doesn't. Your print performance is limited by it, whether you realize it or not. Slicers now automatically hide a lot of the firmware's performance shortcomings from you. For example, the standard practice of greatly slowing down print speeds on perimeters is largely a result of 8bit processors having inadequate resources for two things:\n\nPerforming centripetal acceleration calculations for curves\nacross multiple gcode segments \nKeeping up with gcode transmission/processing and motion planning for gcode with lots of very small segments, such as in organic models or smooth arcs\n\nWhen presented with a series of very small segments in a smooth arc or complex curve, the 8bit firmware will likely choke on the required command processing rate and introduce stuttering to the print. These incredibly brief pauses allow residual pressure in the extruder to push out some extra plastic, making a little zit on the print. So most slicers automatically decimate curves and output gcode with reduced resolution to lighten the load on the firmware. Problem solved, right?\nBut there's another issue -- the GRBL motion control algorithms underlying all the major open source 3D printer controllers were designed with lots of shortcuts and hacks to allow 8bit processors to execute fast enough. For example, the basic algorithm only looks at the speed or velocity change at the corner between two segments, and uses that to decide when to decelerate/accelerate along the direction of motion. It does not calculate or consider centripetal/radial acceleration whatsoever. This is a really effective hack when printing boxy, low-res models, but it fails miserably on smooth curves with lots of little segments. The firmware does not detect any appreciable velocity change at the corner of any two nearly-linear segments within the faceted curve, and thus does not slow down for the curve. So complex geometry is effectively printed at constant velocity, with no acceleration.\nPrinting complex perimeters unaccelerated means the commanded feedrate must be very low to get good quality. Most printers are limited to about 40mm/s or less on complex perimeters, despite being able to run perhaps 80-120mm/s on low-complexity infill before hitting other speed limits.\nBetween the command processing rate limits and motion planner shortcomings required by low power processors, print speeds must be much lower in practice than is strictly required by the physics and printer hardware. This all comes from 8bit processors. The workarounds and best practices to deal with this problem are so deeply baked into the toolchains and ecosystem that very few people realize there is even a problem. But it's a real limit that can be overcome: a high-speed processor running a more rigorous motion planner could generate higher average print speeds with better print quality. \nThat said, the ARM-based firmwares are only slowly moving towards more advanced motion planners. This is a big development area right now that is actually driving an upcoming shift away from low-end ARMs like the Cortex M3 towards even faster processors. It's actually not all that hard to max out an 84 MHz Arduino Due by piling on a bunch of firmware features. \nThe use of 8bit processors also makes printers LOUDER. The biggest consumer of processor time in a typical 8bit printer is the stepper interrupt that fires the step pulses to make the motors move. It is quite typical for >60% of all clock cycles on an Atmega AVR to go to firing step pulses. Because this occurs as an interrupt, other processing tasks that the printer must perform -- like acceleration calculations and heater control -- get squeezed into the brief spaces between stepper interrupt events. \nWithout careful firmware design, the step pulses will completely \"crowd out\" other functionality like LCD display updates and acceleration calculations. In order to allow higher motion rates without using all the processor resources, 8bit firmwares have a mode called \"step doubling\" that fires two (or four, or eight) step pulses per stepper interrupt so that half (or a quarter, or an eighth) as many stepper interrupts can be used to produce the same motion speed. This practice de-bottlenecks the processor, but it causes rougher and louder motor motion because the step pulses are fired in bursts rather than a constant frequency. In effect, the microstepping level of the motor is functionally dropped to a coarser mode when the stepper interrupt fires double or quad steps. So the motors get louder, less precise, and in extreme cases may have problems with resonance. \nAn interesting side effect is that if you switch a Marlin-based printer from 1/16 microstepping to 1/32 microstepping, and keep the same print speeds, the firmware will simply start step-doubling, dropping your effective microstepping level right back down to 1/16.\nARM-based firmwares also use step doubling, but the allowable step rates are typically ~8 times higher before double/quad stepping is used. That can mean higher speeds and/or smoother motion. \nAnother issue with 8bit AVRs is the lack of hardware floating point and need to spend many clock cycles on high-precision calculations or handling very large numbers. Delta kinematics, auto-leveling functions, calculating moves with extremely high step counts for large printers, and other advanced functionality all take a lot of clock cycles on an 8bit processor. Poor firmware design or carelessly adding a feature that requires a few extra square roots and trig functions can completely bog down the processor. This kind of feature creep and code bloat has seriously impacted Marlin's performance over time as people ask more and more of the old AVR. \nIn comparison, a 32bit processor doesn't just have a faster clock and more clock cycles, it is also able to do much more complex math in fewer clock cycles, because it has dedicated hardware functionality that takes care of many of the steps an 8bit processor must do in software. \nDo 8bit processors work? Sure, they work surprisingly well for what they are and what we ask of them. But they unquestionably limit the performance and features of modern 3D printers. Even today's current generation of 32bit processors is already being maxed out by high speed printers and math-heavy features. The 8bit processor is already two generations behind what would qualify as a \"modern\" 3D printer controller. \n", "Dimension SST Printer Broken parts": "\nSeeing as how no one has been able to find a solution yet and I'm not familiar with your machine, I would recommend reverse engineering the part to the best of your abilities.

Sometimes you might get lucky and they will have something more intuitive than callipers, such as a CNC CMM or CMM Arm.

However, you must consider the capabilities of the technology.\nTypically an FDM printer, such as a MakerBot Replicator, can yield undesirable results depending on how small you need the objects and how close each object is to another (ie bearings to the housing/each other). If you have a dual-extruding FDM printer, you could utilize a second support structure material. For example, you could print the bearings/housing in PLA and print the raft/supports using water soluble PVA. This provides a solid structure while printing without worry of having excess material in the housing (defeating the purpose of a bearing).\nOn the other hand, using the powder printer is most likely your best solution for creating the bearings (and less frustrating). Naturally, you will not need to worry about support structures as there is support inherently created as the powder is lain out for each layer. You just need to be sure that the tolerance of your model adhere to the capabilities of this machine and its post-processing.\nRegardless of which technology you use, be sure that your design incorporates a means of allowing support material to be taken out after the print is complete.\n", "makerbot - How to upload my works to Thingiverse without making my real name public": "\nTo change your displayed name (as opposed to username) in Thingiverse:\n\nGo to your profile page\nClick \"Edit Profile\" on the info column on the left\nAt the top, next to \"Thingiverse Settings\" is another link/tab called \"Makerbot Settings\".

And the smallest nozzles I know are 250 micron.\nNot trying to dscourage you, just letting you know. If it was easy to do I think more people would be doing it and more companies would be advertising their printers as capable of such a thing\nSo you'll have around 20 micron Z resolution and around maybe 200 in the X/Y.\nIf that's enough for you, then you could try. Calibrating it all won't be easy, tiniest backlash will be noticeable.\n2) It's a lot easier with curing resin 3d printers (SLA or DLP). Most of them actually have trouble printing larger objects, ironically (trouble sticking to the bed and cracking of the 3d print).\nEven here badly calibrated lasers would prevent you from doing this and even many Form 1 users have reported their lasers being assembled poorly resulting in poor beam profile.\nSize of the laser beam profile (aka laser \"spot size\") is what determines the X/Y resolution for SLA 3d printers. With the Form 2 its 140 micron, unless you'll get a badly calibrated printer.\nFor DLP printers it's easier, it's the resolution of the DLP projector divided from the size of the print area.\n", "fdm - Is it possible to use an aftermarket controller on a MakerBot?": "\nYou can put pretty much any controller in pretty much any printer, with a few noteworthy details you need to keep in mind for a Replicator 1.\n\nMakerbots use thermocouples. Most RepRap style 3d printers use thermistors. So you would need to replace the extruder temp sensors, or choose a new controller with thermocouple support. \nMakerbots use 24v heaters and fans and PSUs. Most RepRap style 3d printers run on 12v (although this is slowly changing because 24v is better for performance and safety.) You can either pick a new controller that is known to be compatible with 24v, or replace all 24v-rated components with equivalent 12v-rated components. \nThe existing heatbed thermistor circuit is probably not the same kind of circuit that your new controller will expect. Older Makerbots use a small voltage divider circuit on the HBP PCB to convert the thermistor resistance to a voltage signal, whereas RepRap style controllers typically have this circuit on the mainboard and thus need only a simple thermistor hookup. You could add a new thermistor, or modify the existing circuit, or get an entirely new heatbed. \nThe existing endstops are full +5v,GND,Signal style mechanical switches with debounce capacitors and LED indicators. These should be compatible with most controller boards given proper firmware setting, but you may need to do some creative wiring if there isn't a suitable three-pin endstop port on your chosen board.\nThe LCD and 5-button panel will not work with other boards. You'll need to replace that or just run a remote host via USB.\nConnectors may be different, of course. That's always an issue with any board swap. \nYou will need to export RepRap style gcode instead of .x3g files. Makerware/Desktop can export gcode but there may be some minor differences in Mcode assignments from what most RepRap style firmware will expect. I couldn't tell you offhand whether this will work, but to be safe, it would probably be best to use a more traditional RepRap slicer (Slic3r, Cura) or Simplify3D.\n\nSo that's a healthy to-do list. At a certain point you're practically building a new printer. But there is a significantly easier approach than installing a RepRap style controller: replace the dead Makerbot Mightyboard with a compatible community-designed Sailfish board like the Azteeg x3 by Panucatt or new CloneBoard Mini by Carl Raffle. Or, if you're ok with Chinese sourcing, a FlashForge Mightyboard will be a near 100% drop-fit replacement for your Makerbot Mightyboard. Any of these options will give you fresh new electronics with minimal hardware changes in the rest of the printer. \nEither way is fine and you'll end up with a working printer. Using another Sailfish board will certainly be easier, if you don't object to staying within the Sailfish/x3g toolchain and Makerbot/Clone parts ecosystem. Makerbot does have a very bad community reputation these days, but it's important to remember that the Replicator 1 Dual is a completely open-source machine from the \"pre-evil\" days, and compatible spare parts are widely available from literally dozens of vendors. The Rep1-derived Makerbots and Clones collectively comprise the most popular single \"flavor\" of 3d printer in the world (totaling as much as perhaps a quarter of all consumer/hobbyist 3d printers sold to date) and many/most of the spare parts for Replicator 2/2x's and clones will also fit in a genuine Rep1. \n", "reprap - How to make your own 3D printer?": "\nYes, look at http://reprap.org for a project that's been doing what you're asking about for about a decade now.\n", "filament - What kind of filter do I need for the enclosure of a 3d printer?": "\nFor the most part, a consumer 3D Printer will only need proper ventilation when using potentially harmful materials such as ABS.

I have heard from a number of resellers that the problems are fixed. Unfortunately, both of those are somewhat biased sources. It's surprisingly hard to get good info on the subject -- very few credible people are talking about recent experiences with the product line. \nIssue #1: The main surviving user forum (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/makerbot-users) has had the torrent of people reporting 5th gen issues more or less dry up. There ARE still people posting issues, but at a fairly low level that is not far outside what you would expect for an average hobbyist printer. What we DON'T know is whether the flood of complaints has slowed because they're working better, or because very few people are actually buying them any more. \nIssue #2: The power-users and community leaders that typically evaluate and review 3d printers are all avoiding the 5th gen line like the plague. Makerbot burned up a lot of community good-will by going closed source with the Replicator 2, and lost more good-will through a series of misunderstandings over patent applications and the Thingiverse terms of service (Takerbot scandals), and put the nail in the coffin by knowingly releasing a non-functional 5th gen product line. Very few credible people are willing to give them a chance at this point, so there is a severe shortage of unbiased reviews.\nIssue #3: Makerbot has a proven history of buying off journalists and reviewers to get positive 5th gen press. Some verifiable examples:\n\nHundreds of fake 5-star Amazon reviews from paid review accounts. A relevant analysis: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JI8LRRXZYNX1/ (Not verified, but related: a widely-believed rumor states that the German Amazon site actually wiped all of Makerbot's 5th Gen reviews because of blatant tampering: http://www.amazon.de/MakerBot-MP05825-Replicator-5th-H%C3%B6he/dp/B0183TP806/)\nThe CES awards initially given to the 5th Gen line were given before Makerbot had functional firmware. None of the 5th Gens at the CES launch were functional. All demo prints shown were made on Replicator 2s. How could a non-functional product win awards? Not hard to figure that one out. \nHistorical positive press in the 3DP journalism media (3ders, Make Magazine, etc) has been directly proportional to the volume of ad-buys from Makerbot or the parent company Stratasys. \n\nI could keep going, but you get the idea. \nSo it's hard to evaluate the reality of the situation. But even IF the Smart Extruder issues are truly all fixed (jams, leveling issues, thermocouple connection, filament encoder failures, etc), there are still meaningful problems with the product line. \n\nThe print quality is not impressive. The motion mechanics, which have not been appreciably changed to my knowledge, are not great. The Smart Extruder is basically a giant pendulum wobbling off the side of a non-optimal gantry selection of an H-bot architecture. Makerbot has addressed the floppy construction via firmware tweaks to significantly slow down the machine to give marginally-acceptable print quality. According to most reports I have seen, a Replicator 5th Gen will print significantly slower than a Replicator 2, for example. Expect in the neighborhood of perhaps 30-40% longer print times than comparable printers.\nThe price tag is roughly double or even triple the current market price for the size and print quality output of the machine. There are so many great printers on the market now for significantly less money that it's kind of nuts to drop the cash on a Makerbot.\nIt is marketed as a PLA-only machine. That's fine if you're printing art and trinkets, but it's not a great option for mechanical parts. While you CAN print other materials, this is not technically supported. \nThe support plan structure has quite frankly become abusive. Makerbot used to have really helpful phone tech support, but the crushingly massive volume of 5th gen troubleshooting requests forced them into a paid tech support model. Around the same time, Makerbot shut down their user community forum and deleted links to external technical resources off their website. So unless you know the right places to go, support is scarce. For official tech support you must buy \"Makercare\" or pay for each help ticket. This is completely out of line with industry norms for a hobbyist/consumer 3d printer. They essentially took their biggest liability -- unreliable printers -- and tried to twist it into a profit center. I personally think this is a significant reason to avoid the company entirely.  \n\nIs it possible to get good results from a Replicator 5th Gen? Sure. But it's a poor value for the cost, from a company that has spent the last few years systematically driving away its former loyal user base. I would recommend staying away until there's some significant change in the product line at minimum.\n", "reprap - Using an Arduino Mega with burnt voltage regulator": "\nTake a look at Ryan's answer to my question.

The Atmega 1280 IO header section is a bunch of breakout pins for debug functions. There are eight sets of signal/5v/gnd groupings. Four of them are currently driving debug LEDs that show flash codes for particular firmware failure modes. The other four are unused as far as I'm aware. \nThe ninth and tenth pins shown in the schematic are located on the opposite end of the board, near the 8U2 chip, to give some hacking access to that chip as well.

Even if there were capable, accurate extruder(s) installed, I think you would need a well designed feedback loop to ensure that you're reading temperatures along the full extrusion process (drive, melt, extrude, etc).\nI believe what you're asking involves more material science expertise, from a design aspect.\nHowever, I believe that the more \"color\" you have obviously reduces the purity of the material and thusly the material properties can suffer. Such properties as thermal resistance found in PLA and ABS. So theoretically if you have Black filament, you'll want to extrude with a lower temperature than you would with a natural \"White\" filament. I would think that the necessary difference in temperature would be a few degrees (Celsius). However, there are many other factors, such as moisture and manufacturing techniques that can take precedence over color differences.\nMy advice, figure out how to \"cheaply\" analyze your material and ensure you have an accurate temperature feedback loop. If can you do that, you'll be able to drastically change the quality of consumer 3D printing.\n", "electronics - Real life stepper speed": "\nThe four main motor speed limits in a 3d printer are:\n\nFirmware step generation frequency limits\nFirmware motion planner effects\nLoss of torque and precision due to motor coil inductance and back-EMF effects\nMid-band resonance\n\nStep generation rate limits will depend on the firmware and controller board used. There is a significant range, particularly when 32bit firmwares and RTOS-based platforms like MachineKit are compared to 8bit firmwares running on Atmega AVRs. Some examples:\n\nMarlin on a 16 MHz 8bit Atmega can only run the stepper interrupt at 10,000 hz without bogging down the processor and blocking other critical algorithms (like motion planning). It can fire step rates up to 40,000 hz by pulsing the step line two or four times per interrupt, which effectively drops the microstep level in software and runs the motors rougher/louder. \nRepetier on the same Atmega can run the stepper interrupt at 12,000 hz, because it is optimized more for execution speed than Marlin.\nRepetier on an 84 MHz 32bit ARM Cortex-M3 can run the stepper interrupt at 80,000 Hz.\n\nThese limits typically only affect actual stepper speed when relatively fine microstepping is used. Consider an example based on a very typical Marlin printer configuration. Microstepping of at least 1/4 is strongly recommended to avoid resonance issues, so let's start with 1/16 stepping. This allows quad-stepping to effectively output 1/4-steps. Starting with finer microstepping will drop our top speed, and coarser microstepping will be louder and may encounter resonance, so this is a good starting point. Then asssume a typical 32mm-per-rev pulley on a 1.8 degree (200 steps/rev) stepper motor. This system has a resolution of 200*16/32= 100 steps/mm. At 40,000 Hz total stepping rate (quad-stepping at 10,000 Hz) we can theoretically travel at 400 mm/s before hitting Marlin's hard cap. That's probably going to be a higher RPM than we want to run the motor anyway, so it's not a very impactful limit. \nIn comparison, if we started at 1/128 stepping (such as with the THB6128 driver chip) our top speed with 8bit Marlin would be 50 mm/s. That's quite slow. \nFirmware motion planners can further limits motor speed by ramping up and down to traverse turns and corners. If the model geometry has lots of sharp turns, the target speeds commanded by the gcode are likely to never actually be reached. Only long, straight line paths will have enough ramping time to hit the speed target. You can see this yourself by printing a very small model at a variety of feedrates and timing the actual print duration: at a certain point, increases in the commanded speed will make no difference on actual print times.\nAnother constraint some firmwares enforce is requiring the ability to safely decelerate to a stop within the length of all the motion commands in the planner queue. This allows the printer to gracefully handle a sudden loss of input, such as as if the host computer stops transmitting USB commands, or if the SD card experiences a series of read errors. If the printer just abruptly stops from full speed when it runs out of commands, it is likely to lose position and ruin the print. Whereas if it can decelerate to a safe stopping speed, it may be able to resume after the command stream resumes. \nIn terms of actual motor behavior, the inductance and back-EMF introduce significant limits because they decrease motor torque at higher RPMs. This produces a torque/RPM curve that drops off at higher speeds:\n\nhttp://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html\nNote in the picture that there is a flat \"constant current\" region on the left side at low speeds. This is the range where the chopping driver is limiting coil current. On the right side of the curve, current is not able to reach the target before it must be switched back off for the next step. That reduces field strength and thus torque.\nThere are two separate effects to consider here:\n\nMotor coils are inductors, which means there is a first-order lag between applied voltage and coil current. A standard bipolar stepper motor with a microstepping driver must raise the coil current from zero to max or from max to zero every full step (eg every sixteen 1/16th microsteps). At high step rates, there is not enough time to fully charge the coil to its max current before the next step requires dropping the current back down. Without developing full coil current on each step, torque is lost. \nEvery motor is also a generator, and spinning the rotor generates back-EMF voltage within the motor coils. That voltage waveform gets overlaid on top of the drive voltage waveform with a phase shift dependent on the rotor position relative to the coil energization position. In simple terms, this voltage attempts to brake the motor: it always does whatever will slow the motor down. This means it opposes the applied drive voltage when the motor is applying forward torque, or assists the applied drive voltage when the motor is applying brake torque. \n\nFor a practical discussion of speed limits, we can simplify the situation by assuming back-EMF voltage opposes the drive voltage applied to the coils. This means there is less effective voltage raising/lowering coil current, and it takes longer for the current to change, and less coil current is developed than would be the case without back-emf. This further depresses the torque/RPM curve of the motor. And when the back-EMF voltage is around the same magnitude as the drive voltage, significant motor instability can result because of complex feedback effects between rotor position and effective coil voltage. \nYou can play with these effects using different motor configurations and speeds for a few popular 3D printer stepper drivers using my stepper driver simulator: https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim \nIn closed-loop applications with position feedback and high-end drivers that can damp various instability modes, it may be ok to run the stepper all the way down the torque curve at very high RPMs. In more typical open-loop 3D printer applications, it's generally best to stick to the low-RPM part of the torque curve before inductance and back-EMF really take over the motor behavior. Losing too much torque can easily mean skipping steps and losing position, ruining the print. \nAnother important effect for steppers is mid-band resonance. This is not a normal mechanical resonance, but actually an electromechanical resonance effect. It's quite complicated, but the short explanation is that a stepper has an intrinsic 90-degree phase shift between position and torque, and when speeds rise to a point where coil inductance introduces an additional 90-degree phase shift between coil current and applied voltage, the electromechanical system has a highly-unstable 180-degree phase lag and thus creates a negative feedback loop. This can rapidly drop motor torque until the motor loses synchronicity with the driver's applied voltage and stalls.\nMid-band resonance only occurs when coil current is limited by inductance. It cannot occur in the constant-current drive range because there is not enough phase lag between applied voltage and coil current.\n\nhttp://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html\nUnfortunately, measured torque curves available from manufacturers almost never show resonance zones, because the curves are produced by loading motors with friction-brakes that damp any kind of resonance effect from building. Whereas a 3D printer drivetrain load is almost entirely inertial (accelerating a mass) which is much more prone to resonance.\nHigh-end drivers can automatically detect and damp mid-band resonance, but typical low-cost 3D printer drivers do not have this capability. \nIt is generally prudent to avoid entering an RPM range where mid-band resonance may occur. This is easily accomplished by sticking to the left side of the torque curve, in the constant-current operating region. This ensures high torque and good stability. \nFor a concrete example, consider the popular Kysan 1124090 stepper with a 24v power supply. \n\nhttps://ultimachine.com/content/kysan-1124090-nema-17-stepper-motor\nTo maintain high torque and avoid mid-band resonance, we would want to keep the RPM to about 400 or less. For the same 32mm-per-rev pulley mentioned above, that would limit speeds to around 200-240 mm/s. Higher speeds are possible, but may encounter reliability issues. \nThis speed, of course, assumes a 24v PSU is used, to match the measured torque curve: a 12v PSU would have a significantly lower top speed before inductance starts to limit coil current, around half as fast. Higher supply voltage greatly increases the top effective speed for the motor.\nAgain, you can easily simulate this effect (using https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim). This simulator output chart shows how inductance and back-EMF are keeping coil current from reaching the target:\n\nFor practical drivetrain design, a motor/driver simulator is really the best tool in the toolbox for finding the point where performance will start to degrade due to inability to hit current targets. It's simply too complex to apply simple equations or rules of thumb with any accuracy. These electrical effects and the firmware step generation limits are likely to be the two main restrictions on motor speed for most printers. \nOf course, how fast you can melt plastic will tend to limit printing speeds significantly below the true motor speed limits, but that's a different discussion. For the moment, we can simply say that top motor speed tends to be unimportant for print moves in typical Cartesian printers. However, there are a few instances where they are likely to drive printer performance:\n\nLinear Deltas, where carriages may need to run several times faster than the effector for certain move directions\nGeared extruders with high reduction ratio (eg much over 5:1) for high retraction speeds\nShort-pitch lead screws (or all-thread) that need high rotation speeds to achieve moderate linear speeds\n\n", "post processing - Practical concerns smoothing PLA print with chloroform vapours": "\nThis Reddit post seems to have some good trial and error dialog.\nThis Thingiverse post, along with many other references online, suggest that the results are very similar to that of an Acetone treatment with ABS. I'm not familiar with the inner workings of how it works, but the general advice is to be conscious of what you're working with. A heat-induced vapor treatment seems to yield the best surface finish, but can be tricky to track down proper exposure times. It seems that the time required to achieve a desirable surface finish depends on the size and openness of the features on the object. By openness, I mean how evenly the vapor is able attach itself to the surface of the object as compared to other features. Some this variability may be reduced by streamlining the process. Perhaps if you found a way to rotate either the part or the vapor container during the process. This could ensure contact is made in small corners/features. Other variables to consider may be:\n\nIf a gradual reduction of exposure is necessary (as is with most heat treatment operations);\nHow much temperature effects time. Most pages I've read mention 100C as the temp to vaporize the chemical;\nSize of the \"vaporization chamber\" in accordance with how much of the chemical is available. I've used a gallon paint can lined with lightly dabbed paper towel with Acetone for part between 1\"^3 to about 4\"^3.\n\nThat's all I can think of, currently, that could potentially have the most impact on the process. Just as with 3D printing, there's not an easy way to definitively know how your parts will turn out. The sheer difference in the shape of your parts could throw out any \"proven process\" you come up with. Hopefully this gives you an idea of what things to look out for in starting out.\nHere's information about safety, before OP added disclaimer\nAs with any chemical, always refer to the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet)! Whichever supplier you acquire the chloroform from, should ship an MSDS with the product. If one is not shipped, you should be able to request one. If they don't have one, don't use the product and don't purchase from them.\nIn most cases, you can get away with finding any MSDS online, but I'd recommend trying to get one directly from your supplier as they might theoretically have a different \"strand\" of the chemical. Therefore, reactions and safety precautions may be different than what you will find online.\nA quick search yields this MSDS which states that chloroform does have \"carcinogenic effects\" along with some other long-term, undesirable effects. As with any other MSDS it continues to go over best-practices and extremity limits.\n\n", "algorithm - How are delta movements calculated?": "\nThere are two main special steps to the technique used by most open-source 3d printer controllers:\n\nDivide each linear gcode segment into lots of very small subsegments (\"Segmentation\")\nUse some basic trigonometry or the pythagorean theorem to tie extruder position to carriage height for each of the three towers (\"Inverse Kinematics\") \nto find the target position for each small segment\n\nThe inverse kinematics are surprisingly simple. A virtual 90 degree triangle is constructed from two known lengths to solve for the unknown third length: \n\nThe fixed delta arm length is the hypotenuse of the triangle\nThe horizontal distance between the column joints and end-effector joints is calculated from the XY coordinates of the nozzle and the fixed position of the column, to determine the length of the lower side of the triangle\nThe length of the upper side of the triangle is calculated from the previous two via the pythagorean theorem\nThe length of the upper side is added to the nozzle Z height to get the necessary carriage height\n\nI think the best open-source reference here is Steve Grave's Rostock Kinematics document, rev3 available for download here: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/deltabot/V6ATBdT43eU/jEORG_l3dTEJ\nSome relevant pictures:\n\n\nThese inverse kinematics calculations are performed for each carriage to get a \"carriage space\" target position, and this is performed for every path sub-segment.\nThe results from these steps can then be reinserted back into the standard linear path interpolation techniques for the printer, in which it fires steps in the necessary ratios and at the necessary rates to produce the desired straight-line motion and acceleration/velocity profile. (How THAT is done is a different question.)\nThe net effect is that the printer will move through a series of small \"linear\" carriage movements (linear meaning constant* speed with respect to time) that collectively approximate the necessary curved (quadratic position with respect to time) carriage motions required to produce a straight-line end-effector move.\n*(Constant speed before acceleration slowdowns are applied in order to obey dynamics constraints, anyway. Again, that's the subject of a different question.)\nSegmentation is very similar to the process of using a polygon to approximate a circle. If the facets are small enough, the polygon is a good approximation. Higher Segmentation rates produce less path-following error.  The primary conceptual difference between drawing circle arcs and Delta motion paths is that the so-called \"faceted arc\" with Delta Segmentation is constructed in height-vs-time coordinates instead of the X-vs-Y coordinates you'd use to draw a circle on a computer screen. \nThis system is used in large part because support for Delta style printers was originally bolted onto GRBL-based motion planners which were written exclusively for straight-line motion paths in Cartesian printers. It was a relatively minimal modification to the existing codebase compared to implementing full quadratic path interpolation.\nTechniques have evolved over the years. And alternate approaches are often used: for example, the dc42 fork of RepRapFirmware performs exact path-following without segmentation, by recalculating the proper time for the next step after every step. This is functionally equivalent to approximating a circle with a polygon facet count so high that every pixel on the screen gets its own facet. So it is exactly as accurate as the positioning resolution of the motors allows. The downside is that this segmentation-free technique is fairly processor-intensive, so it only works on relatively fast controllers, not the older 8bit Atmega AVR that powers most existing consumer/hobbyist printers today. \nOther techniques are possible. The academic parallel robotics control literature is a whole other world of mathematical techniques and complexity in order to produce generalized control algorithms that work for a wide range of robot mechanisms. The version we use in open-source 3d printers is quite simple and application-specific in comparison. \n", "filament - Scalable 3D Printer": "\nOne big challenge with scaling anything up (or down), is that not all properties or characteristics scale linearly.\nConsider a trivial case: a small cube. If you double the size, you've quadrupled the surface area and octupled the weight.\nIf you take a desktop-sized 3d printer design, and just double the size, it will weigh 8 times as much. But all the bolts holding it together are only 4 times as strong. So weight-bearing bolts are effectively under twice the strain (per unit of cross-sectional area); the exact factor depends of lots of things (orientation, leverage, etc).\nIf you scale up by 10x, they'll potentially be under 10 times greater stress, and probably snap.\nMany, many parts will have similar issues: Drive belts that are twice as wide and twice as thick will still have 1/2 the (relative) strength -- and stiffness for the motors to overcome. \nThe stepper motors have to move 8 times the weight, and you'll want them to move far, far faster. But steppers lose torque when you spin them faster.\nMy main printer is pretty much a MendelMax 2, but the Y axis is about 6 times bigger (X and Z are normal). On MM2 the whole build platform moves along Y -- on my printer it weighs far more than on a regular-size MM2 -- it's 6 times the mass just because of size, besides that it has to be much stiffer to avoid sagging over that distance. I went to a larger motor, but it could still barely move the axis. I eventually got it to move at pretty normal speed, but to print long objects it really should be 6 times faster or so.\nThat would require an amazing motor -- and really big electronics to drive it.\nAnother challenge is the printing material -- 20mm diameter PLA fiber would be really impressive, but a little hard to find, and a spool would be hard to lift. The power needed to melt it fast enough would be impressive, too. Bridge and house printers I've seen in reports, use pumped concrete through about a 100mm wide nozzle (I have no idea what the nozzle is made of, to stand up to the abrasion).

For a small and simple delta like a bare-bones Mini Kossel, 8bit may be fine. If you want to do high-speed printing or use any of the fancier features, you should go with 32bit.\nThe big issue with 8bit comes up when you want to do something that taxes the MCU. Delta kinematics already add a lot of extra math on top of all the normal printer functions like command parsing, motion planning, and heater control. For example, adding any of these to an 8bit Delta can cause issues:\n\nBed tilt compensation \"auto-leveling\" -- the coordinate space rotation transform adds a lot of extra floating point calculations to every movement segment. That really taxes the 8bit Atmega since it does not have native floating point support. (Note that pre-print auto-calibration such as in the RichCattell Marlin fork is not the same as bed tilt compensation and does not add any run-time processor load.)\nFull graphics LCDs -- refreshing the LCD screen for animations and status reports takes a surprising amount of horsepower. 8bit Marlin is widely known to suffer from stuttering and print quality issues when running a GLCD on a delta.\nHighly faceted (smooth) curves, particularly over USB -- the high rate of gcode command processing sucks up a lot of clock cycles, particularly in firmwares that run USB comms as a top-priority interrupt. \n\nWhat the Due (or other 32bit board option) does for you is de-bottleneck the MCU so you can push the printer harder or utilize features that add processor load. Here's why they're so much better:\n\nIn simple clock speed terms, the SAM3X8E in the Due/Duet/Alligator/etc is about 5 times faster than the Atmega 2560, and the LPC1769 in the Smoothieboard/MKS-SBASE/etc is about 7 times faster. But they're actually MUCH higher performance than clock speed alone would suggest, because the 32bit architecture and native floating point support mean far fewer clock cycles are required for complex calculations. \nThey also have more RAM, meaning the the firmware can manage more features and look farther ahead when motion planning. \nThey also have more program space, meaning the firmware can, if desired, be compiled as a single full-featured build that covers all possible printers (as RepRapFirmware and Smoothieware do) and thus end-users don't have to edit and compile code in the Arduino IDE to configure the firmware. The Atmega line requires hundreds of conditional compile statements in the firmware to exclude unused features from the binary to get the memory footprint down.\n\nAll that said, the switch from an 8bit Atmega AVR to a 32bit ARM Cortex-M3 is still just an upgrade from a late-1990s processor to an early-2000s processor. Neither is \"modern\" by any stretch. (For example, the BeagleBone Black used by Redeem and MachineKit utterly blows away the Due in processing power and memory. But those options have steep learning curves at the moment.) The Due can still be bogged down by printing very fast with lots of features enabled. It's a big upgrade on an Atmega, but I predict it's going to be replaced by much faster controllers within the next few years. Announcements of upcoming next-gen controller boards are already trickling out. \nTo summarize, the answer is yes, a Due-type board is a good buy if you want a high-performance printer. It will meet 99%+ of user's needs today. But it will be replaced in a few years, just like the Atmegas are being replaced now.\nAs for specific Due shields, I strongly recommend NOT going with RAMPS-FD. It was cloned for sale by Asian companies before the design was finished, which seemingly caused the original designer to abandon it before working out all the bugs. RAMPS-FDv1 has some nasty design flaws such as heaters turning on while flashing firmware. RAMPS-FDv2 is better, but can experience unreliable and oddball behavior due to unresolved issues in the circuits intended to make it compatible with both 3v3 boards like the Due and 5v boards like the Mega. (For example, the thermistor voltage reference circuit needs modifying to work right, and there appears to be timing issues in the 3v3-5v level shifters.)\nRADDS is a good Due shield. It is a simpler, more reliable, more compact version of RAMPS-FD. It is very popular in Germany and has recently (late 2015) become available for sale in the US. \nI also recommend purchasing the Due R3-E instead of the regular Due R3. Anecdotally, the \"E\" version appears to eliminate some firmware bootup issues that can occur when the board is first powered at lower than nominal voltage.\nOne possible downside to the Due is that Arduino just announced they are no longer manufacturing it. So all new Due boards from here on will be made by 3rd parties. That's not necessarily bad, since it's open source and many other companies will surely continue making them, but there won't be any more made by Arduino. \nFor single-board options using the same SAM3X8E processor as the Due, the Duet 0.8.5 is becoming quite popular. (It runs RepRapFirmware, which has some great Delta features.) The Alligator runs Repetier. There are several other beta/experimental/development boards in the works too.

Specifically, the filament path between the drive gear or hob and hot end must be extremely well-constrained. 1.75mm TPE filaments (thermoplastic elastomers) will buckle in an instant if given the chance. That means they will try to squeeze out of any little opening in the filament drive path rather than being forced through the nozzle. \n\nIs there a gap >1mm anywhere between your extruder drive gear and hot end? Including the groove in the drive gear itself. If so, either change extruders or print something to fill the gap. Many popular extruders already have Ninjaflex conversion parts uploaded on Thingiverse or Youmagine.\nAre you using a 1.75mm bowden drive? You probably shouldn't bother with the softer TPEs like Ninaflex. Harder TPEs like Semiflex may be ok, but it's still difficult. 3mm bowden drives may perform ok. Direct drive extruders are highly recommend. \nTPUs (thermoplastic urethanes) in particular can be sticky in the filament feed path between the spool and extruder. Try to minimize corners and turns (even inside PTFE tubes) between the extruder and spool. As a general rule of thumb, don't exceed 180 degrees of cumulative tube curvature in the entire path from the spool to the nozzle. \n\nOnce your filament feed path is fully enclosed, the filament will be constrained and unable to squeeze out the side or wrap around your drive gear. That's the most important step.\nThe next problem is simply loading the filament. Purging out PLA or ABS with a soft TPE can be challenging because of the force required to purge the old material. Many default loading routines are actually too fast for TPEs and will cause the TPE filament to bunch up rather than purging the previous material. It tends to extrude better when there is nothing else in the way. Some tips:\n\nDo some cold-pulls to clear out the hot end as much as possible before loading the TPE. (Nylon is ideal for this. Preheat to nylon temps, run through some nylon, let the extruder cool to ~180C, and then forcefully pull out the nylon. If you can't pull it out, pull hotter. If it leaves nylon behind, pull colder.)\nIf you have a high-melting plastic like PET or nylon in the hot end, purge with a lower-melting solid filament like PLA first. This will reduce the viscosity of the old material when inserting the TPE. \nIf your printer has a fixed loading speed, consider making a gcode file with nothing but a preheat and very slow extruder move as a custom loading script. \nIf you fail to load and jam up the TPE, try again! Sometimes it takes a few load/unload cycles to get the old material purged and a clean feed going. \n\nThe final issue is print settings. You ever hear the saying, \"you can't push a rope\"? That's kind of what you're fighting with TPEs. With a properly constrained feed path, you can push rubber, but not very hard. So minimizing extrusion force is the name of the game.\n\nPrint SLOW to start. Like 10mm/s. You can dial it up once you're getting good results. This will minimize nozzle back-pressure and reduce the amount of \"pushing a rope\" that the extruder drive must do.\nRetract as little as possible. Turn off \"optional\" retractions in your slicer, such as during layer changes. Some people even print with no retraction at all, and use high travel speeds and coast/wipe features to minimize stringing. That's overkill, but it can help with marginal extruders. I personally add about 50% to my normal ABS/PLA retraction distance. \nPrint on the hotter side of the recommended range to start, then dial down the temp as needed to reduce stringing and oozing. Printing hot will reduce nozzle back-pressure.\n\nWith all that, it should be possible to print the softest TPEs with reasonable success. But if you really can't get it working right, plenty of higher-durometer TPEs are available now that are significantly easier to extrude. \n", "extruder - Heat sensor problems with Makerbot Replicator 2X": "\nOverall, it is unlikely that the problem is temp sensing accuracy. There are only a few things that will throw off the thermocouple's reading:\n\nPoor thermal coupling between the tip and the hot block, such as if the tip has partially pulled free of the brass thermowell crimp (this will make the hot block hotter than the reported temp)\nLoss of electrical insulation between the tip and the hot block, plus some ground loop noise or stray voltage on the hot block (this will typically add noise to the reported temp)\n\nYou should be able to visually check for the first, and test for the second with a multimeter. The resistance between the board end of the thermocouple leads and the brass thermowell at the tip should be infinite / out of range. \nTo actually check the thermocouple calibration, you have a few options:\n\nEasy: Look at the behavior of the printed plastic. PLA that is too hot will smell of pancakes/waffles much stronger than normal, or even smell burnt. The printed material may be more shiny than usual. It will string and ooze more as you print.\nModerate: Secure another reference thermocouple (such as might come with a digital multimeter) tightly to the hot block with some Kapton tape, somewhere the aluminum block is exposed. The external TC should read within a few degrees of the printer's TC. (Assuming you get it attached well enough.)\nHard: Place the tip of the TC in boiling water to check if it reads 100C (or slightly lower if you live at a high altitude). Repeat with well-mixed ice water to check if it reads 0C. Both measurements should be within a couple degrees. You will probably need to dismantle much of the extruder to detach the thermocouple for this test.  \n\nBut, again, the problem probably isn't the TC. It's more likely either a bed tramming issue (eg too much gap between nozzle and surface) or the BuildTak is degraded and not adhering. This can happen if you do a large number of prints in the exact same place, or get the surface oily, such as with fingerprints. Try a fresh sheet of buildtak or cleaning it with rubbing alcohol and moving the print to a different location. \nIn some rare cases, low-quality filament or filament stored in very high humidity may not stick well. This is pretty rare though.

The smart sensors within the extruder have been enhanced for better performance and to streamline the printing process from start to completion.\nImproved components include:\n\nA better thermal management system\nExtended PTFE tube to feed the filament into the nozzle\nFaster print start up\nRefined build plate leveling and calibration\n\nThe enhanced smart sensors are a big part of the story here though in that they allow for better speed, along with savings on the bottom line too, keeping users informed about print status from beginning to end, whether from the PC or mobile app.\n", "marlin - default axis steps per unit Makerbot replicator 2": "\nThe Replicator 2 and 2x use 18 tooth GT2 pulleys, 1/16 microstepping, and 200 steps/rev steppers. That makes the proper steps/mm value 88.888889. \nNote that Makerbot used ~88.56 steps/mm in their defaults, which is the value you get if you calculate from the belt+pulley pitch diameter from the Gates GT2 specs. But this is the value you use for calculating belt length required in a closed loop, not for steps/mm. The 88.88... number is more accurate. \n", "replacement parts - Laser cutting on RepRap": "\nPlease do not go down this road. First, not all lasers are equally absorbed by the material and the energy converted to heat to vaporize the material. The light not absorbed is reflected right back into your eyes. This is especially dangerous because it doesn't make you go blind instantly, fooling you into thinking there is no harm. You got the other part right, the lower the laser power, the less turned to heat, the longer it takes to cut, the longer you risk exposure to your eyes. That's right, a low powered laser is MORE dangerous than a big one. Next, the only way to properly cut is with air assist. This means a stream of air blows away the vaporized material so the laser can keep cutting deeper. This also prevents fires. The thing we haven't even touched is a proper safety enclosure, proper bed design to not reflect the laser beam back into the laser killing it and your eyes, and finally smoke/particle exhaust. \nSimply put, these cheapo DIY lasers are dangerous, and are also illegal.\n", "How can I improve the overhang angles my printer can successfully print?": "\nThe two most important things you can do are:\n\nProvide adequate cooling to solidify the plastic quickly\nMinimize layer height\n\nCooling is really obvious. You need the plastic to solidify before it has a chance to sag. PLA in particular has to shed a lot of heat before it is fully solid. A fan and air guide setup using a \"squirrel-cage\" radial blower around the nozzle is optimal. A little 30mm or 40mm axial fan will not provide optimal performance. \nLow layer height when slicing is less obvious, but is extremely effective. When you use thinner layers, two things happen:\n\nThere is less melted plastic per pass and a higher surface area to volume ratio, so the fresh material cools faster. \nA larger percentage of each strand in the overhang is supported by the previous strand. If you do 0.2mm thick by 0.4mm wide, half of each strand is unsupported. But if you do 0.1mm thick by 0.4mm wide, only a quarter of each strand is unsupported. \n\nWhen you combine these two effects, it is possible to exceed 70 degree overhangs with good surface quality. \nAnother lesser factor is printing shells/perimeters inside-out rather than outside-in. This helps anchor the outermost strand a little better as the overhang is built. This is pretty minor though. \n", "print quality - Printerbot printing stringy": "\nThe most common cause of print issues like this is incorrect first-layer gap between the nozzle and bed. You can tell if that's the problem by trying to print with a raft and/or letting the print continue for a while. If the raft helps and the print eventually \"heals up\" and only the bottom few mm are bad, then you have a bed leveling / nozzle gap issue The bed must be leveled to the nozzle properly, or nothing will work right. \nWhen using a probe, you need to follow the manufacturer's instructions for how to configure it. For example, are you adjusting the Z offset in firmware configuration.h or in EEPROM? Printrbot should have a guide for this. \nIf the nozzle gap is fine and the stringiness continues farther up the print, there are two main causes:\n\nXY or Z movement is larger than intended due to incorrect steps/mm value or wrong microstepping setting\nSevere under-extrusion\n\nOf the two, under-extrusion is far more common, and unfortunately has lots of possible causes:\n\nPrinting too cold for the material\nE-axis steps/mm is incorrect for the extruder drive hardware and microstepping\nExtruder stepper current is too low\nExtruder hardware is misaligned or jamming or the teeth are full of plastic dust\nPartial nozzle clog or damaged PTFE tube in the hot end\nCommanded flow rate through the nozzle is too high, such as if you're trying to print big, fat strands at high speeds\nIncorrect slicer calibration (eg extrusion multiplier is too low) or inappropriate slicer settings (eg extrusion width too large for the nozzle size)\nExcessive filament feed path drag between the spool and extruder drive\n\nThe first under-extrusion tests you should start with are:\n\nPreheat and try to push filament through the hot end by hand. Can you get a strand to come out without a ton of force? Does it go mostly down, or curl back up to hit the nozzle?\nRemove the hot end from the extruder drive, and command 100mm of filament motion through the extruder. Measure how much travel you actually get. It should be close to 100mm. \nWith the hot end removed, command some filament motion, and try to stop the filament from moving by hand. Does it take some significant force to get the extruder to stall or slip? \n\nBased on these, you should have a better idea of what needs to be fixed. \n", "extruder - Stainless tip for thermistor": "\nThe main problem here is that the hot block has to match the temp sensor. There are a couple available commercial options for hotblocks with cartridge-and-setscrew temp sensors, but they're not thermistors:\n\nE3D PT100 RTD -- requires a special amp (http://e3d-online.com/V6-PT100-Sensor-Kit)\n\n\n\nCarl Raffle Tecto Heater Block with thermocouple -- works as-is in Mightyboard-based printers, but requires a thermocouple amp for boards that use thermistors (http://shop.raffle.ch/shop/tecto-heater-block/)\n\n\nOther popular options for thermocouples include a brass thermowell crimped onto the tip of the TC (Makerbot and FlashForge) or an eyelet lug crimped onto the tip of the TC (Wanhao). \nThe best off-the-shelf solution for most printers is probably to use an E3Dv6 hot block, which uses a screw and washer to clamp the thermistor leads so the glass bead tip can't pull free of its pocket. \n", "fdm - Is 3D printing feasible for a coaxial rotational joint?": "\nConsider ball bearings\nDepending on the requirements for your joint, I would consider making a design that utilizes ball bearings. With ball bearings, your join will not wear down as quickly, and also move smoothly.\nHandling dimensional inaccuracy\nThe topic of how to achieve dimensional accuracy of FDM printers has already been discussed in this question. You might want have a look at Ryan Carlyle's answer for a specific routine on how to calibrate a Cartesian printer.\nFrom the question linked, a summarized approach for handling dimensional inaccuracy could be:\n\nAdd any desired tolerances into the joint in your CAD model, without regarding the inaccuracy of the actual printer you will use.\nTune your printer and slicer to reproduce those dimensions set by your CAD program.\n\nGenerally speaking, the printer settings should handle filament independent dimensional accuracy, while the slicer should be used to account for different characteristics in each filament type. Correcting size through your CAD model is ill-advised, since you should be able to use the same model for multiple printers.\n", "Print sketchup files (STL) on makerbot": "\nIt appears that you have scaled the object after the raft and supports were added. As you can see in your photo of the raft, the clip is approximately 7/8ths (1.75/2) the size of the raft.\nEdit: As a side note, STL files don't actually have a concept of units. Each axis is defined in arbitrary units. That's why when you export and import it you have to set the scale appropriately. \n", "heated bed - Why does MakerBot Replicator heat the extruder and platform separately?": "\nIt really doesn't quite have enough power to heat everything at once. Initially bringing the bed up to temp takes a lot of current and so Makerbot's start sequences decrease stepper current and hold off on heating the extruder(s) until the bed is preheated. Once preheated, the bed's power draw decreases to a lower \"holding\" level and there is available capacity to do everything else.\nThe start sequencing decreases the max average power draw by a pretty substantial amount. The decrease is about 0.6A each for the XYAB steppers and 1.7A each for two hot ends, totalling 5-6A of avoided peak power draw. (Even lower if you preheat with the steppers disabled rather than idling.)\nThe history here is that one of Makerbot's design decisions with the Replicator 2 and 2x was to utilize off-the-shelf UL-listed power bricks (like a laptop might use) instead of an internal power supply. This made engineering and safety certification much easier, and completely eliminated mains-voltage wiring inside the printer, which is a big safety plus. However, the largest readily-available 24v power brick had slightly less current capacity than optimal. So Makerbot came up with a software workaround for the hardware limitation.\nIf you want, you can replace the stock power brick with a ~350w PSU and preheat everything at once. Sailfish firmware builds intended for printers with properly-sized PSUs (eg FlashForge Creators) will allow simultaneous preheating. \n", "ultimaker cura - Settings for CuraEngine": "\nI think the easiest thing is to use the Cura application together with CuraEngine.\nIf your printer is not supported, you'll need to add it manually by adding a JSON here: https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/tree/master/resources/machines\nBut when you are done you can easily choose all the features you want. For example: generating supports, printing order when printing multiple models, etc.\nCura and CuraEngine are developed at the same time, so you can expect that all features supported by the engine are accessible by the UI.\n", "reprap - What are the advantages/disadvantages of using synchromesh cables instead of belts?": "\nLooking at the specs for both the GT2 belt and the Synchromesh I'm very hesitant to recommend a Synchromesh over a belt.\nThe first thing that sticks out is that there are both error and cumulative error specifications for the Synchromesh. For a device like a 3D printer, I don't like the idea that of my axes can accumulate up to \u00b10.16 in. of error over 100 pitches (the pitch is between 0.12 in. and 0.25 in. so that is 12 to 25 in.). \nContrast this to a belt where the only way you have a cumulative error is if you skip a tooth and I think the winner is the GT2.\nLooking at the non-cumulative pitch error both products are comparable but again the belt wins. For the Synchromesh we have an accuracy of \u00b10.002 in. versus \u00b10.0003(1) in. for a 2 mm GT2 belt and \u00b10.0012(1) in. for a 3 mm GT2 belt.\nNote: I can't be certain about exact values for error since there are no numbers for the GT2 - only a stupid chart. I also have a hard time believing that error is not a function of total length for both the Synchromesh and the GT2 belt but I'm not the manufacturer. However, since both products are made by the same company I wouldn't be as concerned about them trying to oversell one product over the other.\nIn conclusion, I don't see of any reason to choose a Synchromesh over a belt if your physical layout is compatible with both. As pointed out in the marketing material for the Synchromesh, it can be routed along 3 axes whereas a belt works best along a single axis. The Synchromesh seems to be a product designed for a very specific application...\nSources\nhttp://www.sdp-si.com/PDFS/Technical-Section-Timing.pdf\nhttp://www.sdp-si.com/PDFS/Synchromesh-Cable-and-Attachment-Inch.pdf\n", "What are the appropriate ranges of gear ratios for 1.75 mm and 3 mm filament extruders?": "\nThis basically depends on the torque your stepper can produce! A high torque stepper (the bigger the height of the stepper the more powerful the stepper) can push filament with much more force than a stepper motor with less torque. To increase the torque you employ a gear ratio to reduce the speed. As torque and speed are inversely proportional, a reduction by half in speed doubles the torque.\nIf your stepper is powerful enough, you can use a direct drive (no gearing) to push the filament. However if you want that same stepper to move filament of larger diameter, you might not have enough torque to do so. This means that you will have to increase the torque by employing a gear reduction. Using direct drive extruders thus require high torque, and thus high mass stepper motors, this causes the mass of the hotend carriage to increase considerably. Using stepper motors with less torque (often called pancake steppers because of their reduced height) for such applications is often seen together with a gear reduction. A drawback of reducing speed is that you also decrease the maximum print speed ability or max speed filament retraction speed. To reduce the speed you can use a gear reduction using gears or use pulleys and belts. A major advantage of a belt reduction is that it operates without much less noise than using gears.\nLet us assume that you have a stepper that is powerful enough and want to extrude thicker diameter filament. The following guideline can be used to calculate the gear ratio. Also if you express the value in an actual torque, you could work your way back to calculate the gear reduction for a pancake stepper you would use to replace your current X-value torque motor, that is left as an exercise.\nFrom 1.75\u00a0mm to 2.85\u00a0mm\nUnder the assumption that the force that the nozzle exerts on the build plate ($F_n$) is constant for different types of filament size, you would be able to calculate the ratio of force for the extruder ($F_{e}$) and nozzle of any filament diameter using the pressure in the nozzle using:\n$$ p=\\frac{F}{A} $$\nWhere, $p$ is the pressure, $F$ the force and $A$ the area.\n$$ p =\\frac{F_e}{A_e}  = \\frac{F_n}{A_n} \\\\\nF_n=F_e\\frac{A_e}{A_n}=F_{e_{1.75}}\\frac{\\frac{1}{4}\\ \\pi\\ d_{1.75}^2}{\\frac{1}{4}\\ \\pi\\ d_{n}^2} = F_{e_{2.85}}\\frac{\\frac{1}{4}\\ \\pi\\ d_{2.85}^2}{\\frac{1}{4}\\ \\pi\\ d_{n}^2} \n$$\nWhere $d$ denotes a diameter of the nozzle or the filament. Subscripts $e$ and $n$ denote the extruder and the nozzle respectively.\nNote that the force that is generated by the extruder is derived from the stepper torque $\\tau$ directly, or through a geared drive (gearing ratio $R_{gear}$ ):\n$$\n\\tau_{e} = R_{gear}\\times\\tau_{stepper}\n$$\nNote, a gear ratio of 1 denotes direct drive.\nThe force would then be calculated by dividing the torque by the radius ($r$) of the extruder gear:\n$$\nF=\\frac{\\tau_e}{r}\n$$\nCombining equations gives us:\n$$\n\\begin{align*} \n&1.75\\ {filament}\\ \\Rightarrow F_n=\\left (\\frac{1\\times\\tau_{stepper}}{r_{e_{1.75}}}\\right )\\frac{d_{1.75}^2}{d_{n}^2} \\\\\n&2.85\\ {filament}\\ \\Rightarrow F_n=\\left (\\frac{R_{gear}\\times\\tau_{stepper}}{r_{e_{2.85}}}\\right )\\frac{d_{2.85}^2}{d_{n}^2} \n\\end{align*}\n$$\nWhich can be rewritten to:\n$$\nR_{gear} = \\frac{d_{1.75}^2}{d_{n}^2} \\times \\frac{d_{n}^2}{d_{2.85}^2} \\times \\frac{r_{e_{2.85}}}{r_{e_{1.75}}}\n$$\nNote that each $d_{n}^2$ is applicable to the nozzle size of the extruder. Hence, for similar nozzle sizes, the $d_{n}^2$ term cancels out:\n$$\nR_{gear} = \\frac{d_{1.75}^2}{d_{2.85}^2} \\times \\frac{r_{e_{2.85}}}{r_{e_{1.75}}}\n$$\nThis means that if you go from 1.75\u00a0mm to 2.85\u00a0mm filament, for the exact same extruder gear radius (which is not likely as you probably need a different extruder gear/hobbed bolt that can accommodate the larger diameter filament), the gear ratio is $1:2.65$ and therefore you need to reduce the speed accordingly.\nThe reason that you see different gearing ratios can not only be explained by differences in the extruder gear/hobbed bolt diameter differences, but also in stepper torque values.\nFor 3\u00a0mm filament the ratio will be in the order of $1:2.94$ for equivalent extruder gear radii and reuse of the same stepper.\nA similar calculation shows that for a 0.2\u00a0mm nozzle on a 2.85\u00a0mm filament extruder a gearing ratio of $ 1:5.3$ is required. This \"extra room\" for extra torque to fit smaller nozzles also explain the larger gear reductions. What is optimal is not only defined by the nozzle size and filament diameter but very dependent on the stepper motor and the torque it can produce. Gear reductions should be limited so that they do not minimize overall print speed or cause problems with retraction (this latter I experienced myself, a too high retraction speed caused the stepper to miss steps on my custom designed 1.75\u00a0mm to 2.85\u00a0mm bulldog extruder conversion. I'm using a $1:4$ speed reduction to produce enough torque with a stepper that is normally used for direct drive (of 1.75\u00a0mm filament). Note that within the aluminium bulldog housing, a different sized extruder gear is used to accommodate the larger diameter filament:\n\n\n", "software - Point Cloud to STL File": "\nIn order to properly get an STL file out of a point cloud, you'll need some tool to help triangulate the points to create proper shell surfaces. The shell that is created in an STL is what the slicing engine will \"slice\".\nI'm not as familiar with the full potential of MeshLab, but I would think this tool is best suited for files that at least have most of shell already in place. Essentially best for fixing STL's.\nIn the past, I've used (the very expensive) Unigraphics NX8. This CAD/CAM software is very powerful and has tools for creating meshes out of point clouds. I believe it was the sew tool that allowed me to do this in the past (I no longer have access to the software). Other CAD programs such as SolidWorks, Rhino, AutoCAD, etc. might have similar features.\nAlternatively, I think it looks like you might be able to convert a 3D point cloud in SketchUp. If the cloud is layered by height and each layer had points on the same -Z- plane, then you might be able to automate creating lines between the nearest points on the same plane. Then it might just take a little bit of manual labor to \"fix\" the model to become 3D printing ready. Also check out this forum post, it looks like someone had luck in converting terrain point clouds.\nCompletely alternatively, have you considered converting an image to STL? I've done this many times before and it turns out quite nicely. If you can find topographical map of the lake, you could alter the image into grayscale (play with it a bit). Then use software to convert the grayscale image to STL.\n", "filament - PETG Collecting on the Extruder": "\nDifferent brands and blends of PET filaments seem to do this to different degrees. Esun's PETG is definitely one that tends to glob onto the nozzle. Basically, the nozzle plows through the top surface of the filament and lifts up some plastic, much like the bow of a ship lifting up some water at high speeds. PET's viscosity and stickiness seem to amplify this effect more than other filaments. \nSome things you can do to minimize the globbing:\n\nCalibrate extrusion volume on the low end of what you'd normally use for other filaments (how you do this depends on your slicer)\nUse your slicer's \"Z-hop\" or \"avoid perimeters\" feature so you don't do travel moves across printed surfaces\nInvest in an anti-stick coated nozzle, such as are sold by Micro Swiss or Performance 3-d (these don't eliminate globbing, but they do reduce it and make the nozzle much easier to clean)\nPlay with slicer settings such as extrusion width, layer height, and infill/perimeter overlap to reduce the amount of \"excess material\" that sticks above the print surface\n\nAgain, this is a common problem with PET blend filaments. Anecdotally, some brands seem to glob more or less than others, so switching to a different vendor may be worth trying if you want to do a lot of PETG prints. \n", "printer building - Threaded rods to create frame/axis connection. Which improvements can be made and are they needed?": "\nIf I understand you correctly, compared to a Mendel RepRap you are using:\n\nM8 threaded rod (the same kind of rod used in the Mendel RepRap frame)\nroughly the same lengths of rod as in the Mendel, and\ncross-braced with more diagonals than the Mendel design.\n\nSo I expect less vibration and the same print quality as a Mendel.\nRather than put one block of wood at each corner with holes drilled at a bunch of weird skewed angles,\nthe \"1X2 split vertex\" looks like it is a lot easier to construct.\nI've heard several people claim that lots of threaded rods and associated corner connectors can be replaced with a few big sheets of wood in a 3D printer.\nSee Mendel90, RP9, SGBot, WolfStrap, etc.\nLooks like a very educational project.

(Is the end of the threaded rod opposite the motor constrained?)\nEven less likely is that the motor could be damaged.  Since you said it moved 5mm I would have to assume that is several revolutions of the motor so this is unlikely but possible.\n\nThe easiest way to find the problem would be to unhook/remove the threaded rod and see if you can move the carriage up and down the rods by hand, if so you just narrowed the problem down significantly.\n", "z axis - What's the advantage of two z motors?": "\nThere are three main options here for Mendel style ZX gantries:\n\nOne Z screw and motor, which is similar to a cantilevered design but somewhat more stable because of the opposite smooth rod\nTwo Z screws and two motors\nTwo Z screws and one motor, with belt synchronization of the two sides\n\nOf all of these, running two screws off one motor is clearly superior in reliability and user-friendliness. There is no risk of the two sides of the Z stage going out of sync. One motor running at higher current will generally out-perform two motors splitting one driver's current via parallel wiring, because one motor with twice the torque can push much harder when one side of the gantry binds up or hits a rough spot. \nThe only real downside to the single motor, double screw approach is that it requires more engineering and parts. A closed-loop timing belt must be run between the two screws, with associated pulleys, tensioner, and support bearings. In comparison, using a separate motor for each screw is very simple. It adds a stepper and a shaft coupler, but saves a lot of vitamins and design complexity.\nTwo-motor, two-screw solutions are lower-cost and simpler to design. That's why they're used. End of story.\nOne-motor, one-screw Mendel style printers are quite rare. The passive side of the Z mechanism does add a little bit of stability to the X stage, but not a lot. It's possible to rack the X stage out of square with the bed and bind up the gantry. In order to work at all, they require a very wide/tall bearing footprint on the driven side to resist torque exerted on the driven side by the weight of the X stage and extruder carriage. So it's true that they don't have synchronization issues, but additional design challenges and undesirable flexure modes are introduced. It's much more common for one-screw designs to simply cantilever out the X stage, like a SmartRap or Printrbot Simple. \n", "3d design - Tips for making parts that push/snap together": "\nThere are many different ways too approach this and the question may be too broad, but here's a stab at it...\nHere are a few different ways that I've made parts that connect in the past:\nExample 1: Utilize the elasticity of the plastic by creating a semi circle to fit around another object. When fitting the part to the other object, the \"wings\" will flex out and relax around the back end of the object.\nExample 2: T-Slot style designs are a nice choice for semi-permanent or interchangeable parts. The key here is just using trapezoids and make sure the \"female\" end is slightly larger and/or tapered to make it easier to insert the slides.\nExample 3: Create snaps. This can be a bit more difficult, but can provide a more professional look to your design. It's best to start off by designing on L-Shaped slot on the parent part and a smaller L-Shaped extrusion on the child part. Then you can add a taper to the bottom area of the \"L\" to make it easier to insert into the slot.\nExample 4: Creating plugs are similar to snaps, they're just circular. Try starting off with a cylinder and joining either a sphere or a slightly larger diameter and tapered cylinder on top. Then you should be able to snap the assembly into a hole that is slightly smaller than the \"top\" of the plug.\nIt's important to weigh the usefulness of some design choices against the purpose of your part. For me, if I'm designing something for the shop or something that I think I'm going to be swapping out often, I'll use the T-Slot idea. Other things that \"looking pretty\" is more important, I'll try to hide the connections by designing a type of snap that can go into the walls of the part.\nThe T-Slot designs seem to print quite easily with no need for supports (depending on how gradual the angles of your trapezoid are) and provides a lot of structural strength.\nPrinting snaps has been difficult for me in the past and its best not to try to unsnap the part too much as you run the risk of shearing the snap upon removal. Printing such a small feature means that it is usually not marginally strong. However, including multiple snaps in an area and designing them with tight clearances can provide a very neat/clean connection that is appealing for consumer products (for example, phone cases).\n", "How to turn off supports in Z-Suite (Zortrax slicing software)": "\nI've found the answer for myself by playing around a bit more. It seems that in selecting the \"support angle\", a higher angle means more supports. This was confusing me, because I had assumed \"support angle\" meant the maximum angle of overhang before a support would be generated. I guess it does actually mean that, but it counts 90\u00ba rather than 0\u00ba as vertical. In any case, supports are turned off simply by changing it to 0, in which case the text \"not recommended\" does indeed appear.\n", "filament - Which photopolymer for printing?": "\nI think you will find that it will be necessary for you to tune your own printer to a specific resin. Even as important, you would expect to have different parameters for different colors of resin, as each will absorb the UV to a different degree.\nYou haven't provided parameters in your request for which resin to use. You will consider availability and cost of the material you select, as well as the UV light frequency for which a particular product is specified. Temperature range of use is another critical detail.\nYou'll want to avoid resins for which the manufacturer does not provide specifications of that sort. \nIf you pursue this route, you'll find and learn quite a bit.\nRegarding the resin additives for non-hardening: I have not seen such a product and I would not be surprised to learn that it is a proprietary substance and as such, a company secret.\nThere is a recent development of a similar note, a positive one, in my opinion. There is a silicone compound that forum posts have indicated allow the resin to release with minimal or no difficulty and the clarity lasts weeks of use. Current use of Sylgard or the equivalent means frequent re-builds of the vat due to cloudiness of the silicone or tearing of the surface due to excessive stickiness.\nBreakable Glass Silicone has developed quite a following on the B9Creator forums for solving (or substantially reducing) those two factors. That alone justifies the immense expense of shipping from Australia, in my opinion.\nThe easy release of the layers of the model from the surface would mean far more reliability in printing.

It then creates g_COde paths along the lines in this 2d image for every Layer. Using triangles to describe the model will only give small line segments for these 2d slices. Therefore the G-Code creates will only have straight line movements (G0, G1).\nWith a format that can describe curves, the slicer could end up with circles and arcs on the 2d slice and could then use G2 and G3 moves.

I would suggest to mark clearly the cut line and to wrap masking tape at the edge of the cut. Consider to allow for about 2-3 millimeters (1/16\") extra material for final finishing. Cut across the line, rotate the part ninety degrees and cut again. Once you have the guide cuts in place, you should be able to manage a square cut by following those guides\nYou will want to have a clamping mechanism available, such as a vise or workbench type device. \nAfter the cut is done, use a sharp file to make final adjustments to the length and appearance. Push the file, do not drag it backwards. Push forward, lift away from the work piece as you return, then push again. Pick up a file card, which is a fine metal-tooth brush used to clear the teeth of the file.\nIt is very easy to remove material with a hand file, perhaps three or four strokes to remove 1/16\".\nYour accuracy will depend on the measurement of the lines you create and how carefully you file to the edge of those lines.\n", "Slic3r - Can I add new infill patterns?": "\nAlthough the core of Slic3r is written in C++ a lot of other components such as infill generation are written in Perl.

I would recommend returning it or throwing it away and buying from a more reputable vendor. A large fraction of all cheap 3d printer parts these days are ridiculously far out of compliance with US/EU regs and basic common sense for contamination. \nIf you're hell-bent on using a crappy knock-off belt to save a few bucks, you could put it under vacuum to try to suck out the residual chemical gas faster. Just apply the vacuum very slowly / in stages (say over 10 minutes) so you don't get decompression blisters in the rubber. You shouldn't need a hard vacuum, dropping to 0.5-1 psia or 0.05 bar absolute for a day or two should help significantly. No guarantees though. \n", "Analytic equations to make algorithm of 3D printer": "\nAs shown, the mechanics are under-constrained. You can't solve for theta because you have three degrees of freedom (X, Y, theta) and only two constraints (L1, L2). Gravity will tend to bias theta in a particular orientation, but the geometrical stiffness of this arrangement will be so low that it will not be possible to do 3D printing. \nTo calculate the free-hanging orientation of theta, you will need to know the center of gravity of the end-effector, and solve a system of equations to find the angles and tensions for each cable that produce force vectors which sum to equilibrium with the gravity force vector through the COG. Unfortunately, the tensions will be a function of the angles, so it's not trivial to solve. As a hint, the virtual intersection of the two cables will be coincident with or directly above the COG in all equilibrium positions, and the horizontal components of the tensions in the two cables will be equal. \n", "It is worthwhile to protect electronics with a 3D printed PLA case?": "\nIt depends.\nProtecting your electronics from being touched by random bits of conductive material which would short and fry them is always a good idea.\nIf it's something that will be visible, then a pleasant printed casing might go well. You might just as well use any other casing though, there's no requirement it be 3D printed.\nFor a very small circuitboard (an inch or less) heatshrink tubing might be a better form of protection. Or just insulating tape.\nIf you never intend to access the circuitry again and heat dissipation isn't a big issue, then just putting the whole lot in potting compound may work best for you - complete waterproofing and environmental protection.\nOr you could just tape a bit of plastic from a 2l coke bottle over it, and get 99% of the protection you'll ever need, and still keep the circuit visible and accessible.\nUltimately, it boils down to: Do you want it to be covered?

If you use twice the wire cross section by using 4 instead of 2 wires, you also reduce the resistivity and hence heat created in the wire.\nPut it the other way around: Using 2 instead of 4 wires raises the risk of your setup to catch fire.\nStill, you can use that bridging technique, if you make sure that all your wire diameters are big enough.\nI would advise you, however, to cut the wires that come with your kit in half and use the connectors in the way they were meant to.

How hard is it to pull through? It should only take 1-2 lbs of tension at most. \nThen do a \"tug test\" on the extruder. Start it loading and grab the filament by hand to try to stop it from extruding. The Replicator 1/2/2x extruder style can typically pull ~8-10 lbs of tension and it should be fairly difficult to stop the filament. When you do stop the filament, you should hear clicking/thumping from the stepper stalling, NOT quiet grinding as the drive gear chews through the filament. If the grip slips rather than stalls, your extruder hardware needs to be tuned or replaced. \nThere are three common causes of excessive feed tube drag:\n\nUse of polyethylene tubing instead of PTFE -- this makes a shockingly large difference in drag friction. You can use a heat gun or torch (outside!!) to tell the difference between PE and PTFE. PE will soften quickly and then melt fairly easily, whereas PTFE will simply go clear and eventually char without melting. Nylon is also sometimes used for feed tubes with acceptable results, but if you have any suspicion about the tube material, just buy new PTFE tubes from a reputable vendor like McMaster. \nToo many loops/curves in the tube. Total drag friction is an exponential function of the total amount of curvature in the tube. You should have one good U-loop, no spirals or floppy zig-zags. \nExcessive friction on the spool rotation. Any spool back-tension gets greatly magnified through the feed tube per the capstan equation. This can be caused by a bad spool holder, or if the filament is knotted on the spool due to letting the end of the spool loose during handling. \n\n", "3d design - Designing clips that won't break": "\nIt looks like those clips are thin and need to bend pretty far to let the vial out.

The main problem with flexible filament is the path between the drive gears and entrance to the hotend must be completely constrained or the filament will push out of any gap.  Ninjaflex is very flexible and absolutely will not work unless you constrain it right after the contact point with the drive gear.  Semiflex is another flexible filament but quite a bit stiffer than Ninjaflex, I've never used it but it should be a bit more forgiving on the path requirements.\nI know there are several other flexible filaments but I've never worked with them so I only mentioned Ninjaflex which I have used.\nThe model used in the blog can be found here - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:586514\n", "diy 3d printer - Easiest way to build a horizontal hotend mount at home, without printing": "\nYou could cut a v-notch groove in a piece of plywood to hold one side of the groovemount neck, and then use a bolt through another piece of wood to push the neck into the V-notch. \nThere are lots of options when building RepStraps and JunkStraps.

If you want to justify buying a printer because of all the things you could print instead of buying that is not going to be easy. \nIf however you are a DIYer and you have some CAD skills, or are willing to learn some, then consider the 3D printer as another tool you can use. There are plenty of stories about people who fixed some very expensive thing instead of having to buy a whole new one for hundreds of $/\u00a3; so if you have a specific use in mind then it may be justifiable to you.\nI have made and fixed stuff around the house, but it's often things you simply couldn't buy, or could have fixed some other way.\nThere is an ever growing library of models available out there, and many are free. I recently fixed the leg on my keyboard with a printed one which I found on thingiverse, took minutes to print and the keyboard is part of a wireless set which would cost \u00a330 to replace, so that was great but you won't normally find exactly what you want like that at this time.\nAnd lastly it's not plug 'n Play yet, so you need to be a tinkerer at heart to use most printers out there right now.\n", "ramps 1.4 - HE3D-XI3 3D printer Repetier software config help!": "\nBased on some troubleshooting in the question comments, it appears that the issue here is the motors running the wrong way. This can be fixed EITHER by inverting the motor directions in firmware, OR by simply flipping the orientation of the motor plugs where they connect to the controller board. Flipping the plugs is an easy and quick way to reverse the phase of a stepper and thus reverse its direction of motion.\n", "extruder - What kind of silicone glue should I use to attach my thermsistors?": "\nThe main requirement here is temperature resistance. A 3D printer extruder is very, very hot, and will easily exceed the ratings of many typical silicone glues in normal service or during a runaway event. (You should always plan for an eventual thermal runaway. They're alarmingly common with cheap kit printers.) Even high-temp glues will not survive the temperatures an extruder can reach at full power if the firmware locks up. \nMuffler putty is popular for fixing thermistors because it's one of the few widely-available ways of attaching a thermistor that will easily withstand the heat. In fact, it will survive after the aluminum hot block melts. (Yes, that can happen.) But muffler putty is fairly brittle, and has a different coefficient of thermal expansion from aluminum, so there is some risk of the thermistor detaching over time. I really don't recommend puttying thermistors used in extruders -- many people do, but it's less robust and less secure for long-term use than the proper hardware fixing methods found in modern hot block designs like the E3Dv6. The temperature sensing is sufficiently fast and accurate simply by putting the thermistor into a pocket in the hot block, without any kind of potting around the glass bead. \nHigh-temp RTV glues are very suitable for heated build plates. Pretty much any RTV (such as from your local automotive repair store) is fine if you just want to attach a thermistor to a plate. However, silicone heaters will require silicone adhesives. I've had good success with Dow Corning 736.\n", "rsin - Cons to UV printing - 3D Printing Stack Exchang": "\nTaken in order your questions:\nMaintenance for a resin printer means keeping the vat or tray clean, using appropriate methods to remove the unused resin (or leaving it in the vat per manufacturer's directions). Cleaning the tray should be done also per manufacturer's spec, although each printer's user forum may provide better or more effective options.\nThe Pegasus Touch has a caution regarding dripping resin on the mirrors, so there's operational care considerations for these types of printers.\nThere is a build platform for these printers. The flatness and level are as critical or more so for resin printers, as the resolution can be astonishingly high. If any portion of a print does not bond to the platform, that entire print will have a failed section, creating an entirely failed print. Gravity is not particularly helpful in that respect, at least with the Pegasus Touch.\nThe release medium varies from device to device. The Pegasus Touch originally used PDMS (silicon release compound) and now uses what's called a SuperVat. The plastic material in the SuperVat is purported to provide better release and fewer failures, along with increased lifespan. PDMS becomes cloudy from repeated printing in the same location and can be torn away from the vat if the print does not properly release.\nI've become aware of a product from Australia that has had good reports from use in a B9 Creator resin printer. The report indicates that it releases the model quite easily and barely turns cloudy. I have an order pending for this material, as I am hopeful it will perform as described.\nThe mechanics are also varied. One expects a system to raise and lower the build platform and to direct the laser or illumination system (DLP), but generally, this type of printer is somewhat simpler mechanically.\nBecause I live in a hot humid climate, my Pegasus Touch remains in the box, and my brain is about to explode with what I've learned of using it. Environmental conditions are likely to vary with different machines. I've seen references that 70 degrees F is too cold, others that say 70-75 degrees F is just fine, anything higher is too hot. Another user says that 65 degrees is good. The type of resin also becomes an important factor for environmental conditions.\nThe laser will create heat in the resin, so I'm inclined to believe that cooler is better. Different colors require different durations of laser light, somewhat akin to various plastics having different temperatures.\nsupports and overhangs are important considerations in an SLA or DLP printer, just as they are in FDM.\nExpect also that many of the resin printers require that the user purchase only the product provided by the manufacturer. This isn't necessarily a negative as most of the resin sources are priced similarly.\nIf I've missed any part of your question, let me know.\n", "file formats - Convert G-code to SVG": "\nThere are a number of programs available which will convert g-code to DXF, a common drawing format.

This may lead to clogging or skipping depending on how hot your extruder is at that point.\nAs a last resort, you can perform a Boolean subtract on your model of the section that's already printed and re-slice the model to print the remaining bit. Then glue, or ABS weld, the remaining piece to the main print. I've done this in the past, it's not super glamorous, but it gets the job done if the part doesn't require a lot of structural integrity.\nI was incorrect with the following statements with regard to the Cura slicing engine: \nIt's been a while since I've looked at 3D printer G-Code, but from what I remember, E values can be the bane of any manually written G-Code. Usually the slicing engine generates the E value as an incremental step value throughout the G-Code (at least this was true for Skeinforge and early MakerWare, please verify this). So, if the value is incremental and depending on the controller, this value could be lost or corrupt if a new print is initialized.\nI would hope, that if you're using a slicing engine's custom G-Code input, that the software would be able to compensate situations like this and reformat your provided G-Code to match the value of E or any similar command.\n", "calibration - Adjusting the Z end stop?": "\nTypically a machine will rapid to find its software stop(s), retract and slowly find its mechanical end stop.

GC 10-8118 is only rated for 200C, but the service conditions at the power resistor may run up to 300-400C depending on power output and desired hot end temp. \nFor that matter, you may want to question whether the power resistor itself is rated for the >300C temps it will see in normal service. It's probably not. Most modern hot end designs use steel-jacketed heater cartridges instead of power resistors because they can handle higher temps and are, you know, actually designed to be used as heaters.

Since basic optics wants to focus on a sphere, when projecting on a flat surface you have to adjust for a focus distance that varies with angle and also deal with keysoning. I know this is a common problem fro projectors; but, there is no perfect solution so either.    The focus issue may be solvable with custom optics; but, that is not something that is easy to DIY.  The keystoning could be corrected for with optics and/or in software; but even then you are going to have inconsistent resolution.  Not only that; but, the problem gets worse the wider and closer you are, which is EXACLY what you want to do.  \nI would be concerned that the frequency range that the SLA resin cures at will be outside the normal range of projector so you would require A LOT more power/time to get it to cure.\n\nOn the other hand, lasers light projectors are a well established technology.  They moved into the entertainment space quite a few years ago; so, I suspect you could get one that covers the space you are interested in for a reasonable price. \n\nSince laser beams are very narrow, focus should not be an issue.  Keysoning can be easily accounted for in the sweep algorithm.\nYou could choose the frequency of the laser to that it in the most efficient curing frequency for the resin you want to use.\n\n", "e3d v6 - Can I increase retraction length on an E3D v6 beyond 2 mm if I have a really long Bowden tube?": "\nYes, you can increase retraction past E3D's max 2\u00a0mm recommendation to compensate for Bowden tube stretch and slop. The reason for the recommendation is that jams will occur with most all-metal hot ends if you pull molten filament up into the cold zone. Any molten filament that enters the cold zone rapidly cools and hardens and sticks to the walls, very often forming a jam. \nSo, the requirement is to keep your retraction distance at the extruder less than 2\u00a0mm. Additional retraction travel that is absorbed by the Bowden tube and not seen at the extruder is fine. I personally run 2.5\u00a0mm retraction on an E3Dv6 Bowden system without any issues. \n", "extruder - How to compensate for bad quality filament?": "\nI am only going to answer the part of the question about how to improve the results from low-quality filament:\nThere have already been projects going on dealing with the issue of varying filament diameter.

You could think of an extrusion multiplier or a change in the steps/mm value. Of course this has to be calibrated for the distance the filament needs to travel from measurement to hotend.\nA good first read can be found in the following project:\nhttp://forums.reprap.org/read.php?13,222517\nAnd the corresponding Thing page:\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:454584\n", "abs - Why is my print displacing along the y-axis by 2-3 cm?": "\nI had exactly the same effect when my stepsticks where overheated.\nSo my solution was to add cooling fan and reduce current on stepsticks.\nOf course heatsink is obvious.\nPlease note that different axis requires different current settings.\nFor example, in Prusa and clones, X and Y need a bit less current as one stepstick controls one motor but Z axis usually uses 2 motors connected to 1 driver.\n", "extruder - Teflon tubing in nozzle throat coming out?": "\nIt looks like you got too tight nozzle, too cold hotend or extruding speed is too high (all could be in the same time of course).\nAs filament goes into the teflon tube (coldend) and then into hotend it doesn't have enough time to go out throught the nozzle.

Here's a swap video from Fargo3D: https://youtu.be/vL80bslk9vw\nI would recommend \"mk8\" Makerbot Replicator 1/2/2x style nozzles, since these will be similar dimensions to the original nozzle. Ebay has lots of cheap ones, or P3-d and Micro Swiss are popular options for premium Makerbot mk8 style nozzles. But you should be able to use any standard M6 male thread, ~2mm ID nozzle (such as from E3D, because the Smart Extruder Z homing routine will compensate for nozzle length. \nWhen you change the nozzle, you're also going to need to change the slicer settings. Do not use default settings with a different nozzle. Smaller nozzles will require significantly lower print speeds, and larger nozzles will require wider extrusion width. You can create a custom profile in Makerbot Desktop to do this, or use a 5th-gen-compatible slicer like Simplify3D. \n", "prusa i3 - Which algorithm does Marlin use to create arcs?": "\nThe algorithm is based on the \"Vector rotation by transformation matrix\", and this solution is based on a solution from Jens Geisler.

With that additional info we can conclude that your printer per se is working fine. To me, if the plastic is curling up to a ball, it seems that you are either having\n\na wrong temperature set\nwrongly calculated e-steps, volume calculation (filament diameter) or multiplier in the firmware\nadditional first layer parameters are off (height, offset, extrusion)\n\nYou can try to set the extrusion multiplier just to test if it is a simple miscalculation.\n", "How does the Filament production process work?": "\nSome general comments about the process used (plastic extrusion):\nThe plastic extrusion process is not simple- many textbooks dense with equations have been written about it. The lowest cost industrial extrusion processes do not use pellets at all- because pellets have already gone through an extrusion process so they are more expensive than powder resin. There is typically a 'compounding' stage where colors etc. are added before extrusion. \nSignificant heat is generated by the screw (which often has a complex geometry) via shear action that is itself temperature and pressure sensitive, and the heat is added to by external heaters in various zones (or subtracted by water cooling and chillers in larger extruders). In some cases we were able to operate an extruder adiabatically- the heat created by the screw motor matched the heat loss as the product left the die and no heating or cooling was needed once the process was stabilized. \nThe end result is that you want to plasticize (melt) the plastic and achieve a certain pressure at the die. The plastic is deteriorating the higher the temperature and the longer the time so you want to limit the residence time at high temperature. There is some trial-and-error and a lot of previous experience in the setup person's task. Once the parameters are determined they are recorded and are used the next time that material is run.  \nThe size of an extrusion is typically determined exactly by downstream equipment rather than controlling the conditions at the die. It is essentially stretched as it comes out of the die and the heat is removed in a cooling trough. \nHere you can see a factory environment with a very typical extrusion setup, used in this case for 3D printing filament (but the setup would look almost the same if they were making slats for Venetian blinds). Notice that there are cooling fans as well as band heaters on the extruder barrel. They control the diameter by adjusting the take-off capstan RPM once the extruder is running well. This extruder looks like it has 4 heat/cool barrel zones and two (heat-only) nozzle zones (6 temperatures total). \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40HOAsUnSQ8\nExtruders are categorized by the barrel bore diameter in inches or mm. A very small extruder might be 25mm. An extruder used for pipe production might be 6\" (150mm) or more. Some machines use multiple screws. \n", "extruder - Brass rails, bunting bearings ok for x,y axes?": "\nExtruders tend to be quite light. An E3Dv6 complete with fan, shroud and wires is under 100g. Unless you use a Bowden extruder, you also have to add ~300g for a stepper motor. In any case, it will be quite light.\nSintered bronze bushings can definitely be used in a 3D printer; they're used in the (quite popular) Ultimaker 3D printers. I can't tell whether your particular bushings will work well, but I think the most important consideration is that there isn't too much play between the rod and bushing (but I'm assuming you took care of that). 3D printers don't place high loads onto the motion system.\n\"Proper\" LMxUU bearings aren't very expensive either (reasonable ones can be had for less than $2) so if the bushings don't work out, you could always try those.\n", "printer building - Carbon fiber instead of smooth steel rods?": "\nSteel is the best material for a linear rod when you have a fixed cross-section. It will have the least flex of any rod (aside from some exotic metals) of the same size. \nCarbon fiber's material properties might seem superior at first sight, but the stiffness is very anisotropic -- it's very stiff along the grain and not very stiff across the grain. So multi-axis stresses like bending aren't necessarily going to perform up to the theoretical specs. Carbon fiber has exceptional stiffness-to-weight ratio, but the stiffness-per-area isn't necessarily superior in this application. \nPeople do occasionally use carbon fiber for linear rods/rails, but only in much larger sizes than 8\u00a0mm. Think >25\u00a0mm. \nAnd that's really the problem here. 8\u00a0mm diameter at 550\u00a0mm long is well outside what's reasonable for bending stiffness. Bending deflection increases with the CUBE of length, and this is simply far too long for the size of rod. The general rule of thumb for precision motion applications is length < 25*diameter. That's a conservative rule, but it's the right ballpark. You really shouldn't be going over 200-250\u00a0mm or so with an 8\u00a0mm rod. \n", "reprap - Is there a lubricant that can be used for linear bearings, bronze sinter bushings and threaded rods alike?": "\nA mid-weight PTFE grease like the popular Superlube will work in all the cases you mention (bearings, screws, and sintered bushings). 3D printer service conditions are quite light-duty as far as lubricants are concerned. You really just need to keep everything a little bit \"wet\" with oil or grease and performance will be adequate. \nThe main downside to using grease with sintered bushings is that they will likely stop being \"self-lubricating\" after the first exposure. The grease tends to clog the pores that allow the sintered bushings' factory oil impregnation to maintain a nice oil film on the sliding surfaces. So the bushings will forever-after require regular re-greasing, just like the ball bearings and threaded rod. \nIn comparison, a light machine oil like 3-in-one will maintain the sintered bushings' self-lubricating properties, but if used in ball bearings and screws will require very frequent replenishment. And that is certainly an option -- oil DOES work on bearings and screws -- but odds are good that you'll eventually over-oil the bearings, get drips on the build plate, and bang your head against a wall trying to figure out why your prints won't stick all of a sudden. Grease doesn't need to be applied as often, and it tends to stay where you put it rather than dripping. So grease is generally preferred to oil if you have to pick just one lubricant.\nAgain, the most important thing is to keep sliding and rolling surfaces wet with something. You'll just have various maintenance trade-offs with different options. \n", "3d design - Why are the STL files for the Ultrascope telescope at 45 degree angle?": "\nThe orientation of the part in the STL file depends on the Software that creates the file. I had a software that would export the parts standing upright instead of laying flat. Depending on the CAD software it can be beneficial for the creator of the model to create in in a different orientation as the one you want to use for printing. Also not all CAD Engineers know (or care) about the best orientation for printing a part.\nSo my guess is that this is an issue of file export/ STL file creation.\nIt is totally normal to rotate the parts into a position that is best for printing.\n", "What are the ideal print conditions for polypropylene?": "\nPolypropylene CAN be printed with excellent results, you just need a good filament roll and good printing setup.\nA few days ago I read this topic and was kind of afraid of testing it, now I am so happy I tried it.\nI am printing the PP filament from the brand Smart Materials 3D (search on google).\nI am using a Prusa i3 Mk2, bed heated to 70\u00baC and hotend to 210\u00baC.

Compression along the lines of the construction layers would be reasonably strong, but forces applied in other directions are likely to match only the characteristics of the bond. The same consideration applies to shear strength.\n", "Can a sandstone 3D print be printed as a solid object?": "\nYes, you can just print it solid.

In this example, it would be interpreted as G0 X1 rather than (as might have been intended) G0 X103.54.\nThis explains my symptoms perfectly:\n\nX and Y always moved to (approximately) their home positions, but it was always only one of them (it's quite unlikely that both moves are corrupted).\nZ was not affected because Z moves are much rarer in the G-code (only on layer change) and thus it was very unlikely that a Z move would be affected.\nE was not affected since a request to move E to near 0 would be prevented by Marlin's long extrusion prevention.\n\n", "mechanics - How does Carbon3D's CLIP technology handle bridges and support material?": "\nOn Carbon3D's homepage they show a part that appears to have supports in it. \n\nPer a conversation with Carbon3D's support they confirm that their slicing software will generate supports based on the overhang angle geometry, and in the case of a buckyball within a buckyball, there would be supports generated to create the buckyball, and to support the interior buckyball joining the two together that would have to be removed in post processing.\nEnclosed volumes need to have a drain hole, and you would have to avoid vacuum forming shapes such as an upside down cup in which atmospheric pressure would keep the interior of the cup filled with resin until the reservoir runs out or the vacuum is able to be broken releasing the excess resin. In the case of a cup you would change the orientation. I am not sure how one would handle trying to print a solid sphere with no holes to avoid this condition.\n", "calibration - Determining the temps and speeds for DIY printers?": "\nThe short answer is, you use the temps and speeds that give you good results. It's trial and error. \nThe temperature number your printer reports really doesn't matter. That's just a process control variable: it needs to be consistent and repeatable, but it doesn't need to be accurate against an independent reference. What you should care about is your print results. \nSome signs your printing temp is too cold:\n\nPLA printed parts have a dull, matte surface\nPoor layer adhesion\nExtruder stalls or strips the filament at fairly low printing speeds for your extruder and nozzle size\n\nSome signs your printing temp is too hot:\n\nPLA printed parts have a very shiny surface\nPLA has a very strong sugary/waffle smell, or any material smells burnt\nStringiness during travel moves that you can't eliminate by tuning retraction\nExcessive oozing while the nozzle is stationary off the print\nBubbles or cloudiness in extruded strands in extruded strands even with dry filament\n\nYou will also calibrate speeds via trial and error. There are two main speed limits for a printer: how fast the motion mechanism can move the nozzle without running into issues or unacceptable print quality degradation (which is also a function of acceleration settings), and how fast the hot end can heat up and melt filament. \nThe mechanism speed limits you have to find via trial and error. Pick a test print you like (such as Benchy) and repeat it with different tuning until you find your preferred limits.\nMelt flow restrictions are slightly more complex, because they are a function of VOLUME flow rate, not commanded speeds. Make a large boxy test print (with long straight lines) and multiply extrusion width times layer height times feedrate. That will give you your approximate flow rate in mm3/sec. Generally speaking, every extruder + hot end + material combo will have a maximum feasible flow rate. For example, most \"average\" hobbyist printers with 0.4\u00a0mm nozzles and good extruders can extrude about 4-8\u00a0mm3/sec with PLA. PTFE-lined hot ends are at the lower end, all-metal hot ends are at the higher end. The value will depend on your hardware. But you can do a few quick benchmarking tests to find the limit, and then use that to determine peak feedrates to avoid exceeding the melt capacity of your system. \n", "hardware - Which belt tension gauge do I need?": "\nIt's extremely unlikely that belt tension is actually your problem. I've never heard of anyone using a gauge to measure their belt tension. Typically you just pull your belt tight by hand so that it produces a low note when plucked. It's far more likely that you're experiencing shifts due to too high or too low stepper current.\nUnless your belt is so loose that it easily skips over the pulley (which should be obvious without using a gauge) or so tight that it completely binds up (it would be impossible to get it that tight without some kind of superhuman force) it's definitely not the problem.\n", "delta - Looking for information on modifying Boots Industries 3D printers": "\nContact Brian or Lykle.

There may be a single combination of circular shapes (radius) and spacing for these shapes that provides your objective, but that's likely not a practical exercise.\nYou have not indicated if you've tried other slicers, which would be the primary direction. A list of choices can be found here:\nFree Slicing Program List\nAnother option that you can consider, not included in this list, is to use OpenSCAD, import the STL file, then use the projection() command to manually slice and export the image file. I use the term \"manually\" but the program can be coded to perform this task automatically, and there is a command line feature to OpenSCAD that may be useful.\nNote also that the output of these slicers and/or OpenSCAD may exceed the resolution you desire.

You can edit the number of coils and the coil thickness in the Maya GUI.\nOnce you have the thread, it is a simple matter of performing a couple of boolean operations. The first boolean (union) operation will unite the screw made in step 1 with the thread made in step 2. The second boolean (subtract) operation will cut out the thread from the object within which you want your screw to be driven into. When you print the two models, you should find that the screw nicely turns into the object from which you cut out the thread.\n\nThe point is: yes, it is easy to do such things in most 3D software packages. Maya comes with a nice selection of default objects you can use, so essentially you need to do no 'modeling' yourself to create something like the example you showed us.\nYour next question, about editing models on Thingiverse. The reason why you cannot edit them easily is because most models there have been decimated and triangulated, which makes them very difficult to reshape or edit because the topology is no longer strictly manifold -- it is just a big mess of triangles! \nIf you want to edit Thingiverse models, I recommend something like ZBrush. You can import triangulated models and then rebuild the geometry into quads (using DynaMesh, for example), which you can then edit to your liking. Once done, you can simply decimate and re-export as STL or whatever extension you need.\nFinally, low/high poly is not so relevant in 3D print outs, especially in mechanically functioning parts. This is because most models are created in high resolution (high polygon count) and then decimated + triangulated down to truncate file sizes. But the functionality and physical feel of the model should not change due to this process - it just takes practice and lots of experimentation.\nHope this helps :)\nHassan\n", "3d models - 3D printer calibration test STLs?": "\nYes.\nThere are more test models one can download than would be possible to list here.

But if you try to run a large appliance (dryer, hot tub, etc.) on a smaller amp circuit, the breaker would blow because you are trying to draw more than it can supply.  \nThe point is, get something rated for higher than you need, within reason.  It will draw only what it needs.\nPro tip:  Make sure to set the current limits on your stepper motor drivers for maximum performance!\n", "Is there any way to shrink 3 mm filaments down to 2.85 mm?": "\nI would not recommend you to try and somehow re-size the filament, since even the smallest of irregularities and error in diameter occurring from such a process would ruin your prints with sporadic over and under extrusion. Rather, if you have the tools available, you could grind the filament into pellets, and use a filament extruder to make it anew with your desired diameter. \nAlternatively, depending on your printer setup, you might very well extrude true 3.00 filament with your 2.85 mm filament printer. If you try to do that, make sure to:\n\nAdjust filament diameter in your slicer\nCheck that your filament isn't getting squashed by the extruder wheel\nCheck that all mechanical parts actually can pass through your filament freely\n\nI do not own a 2.85 mm printer myself, and therefore have not tried this procedure. There are, however, several people who seem to have done this successfully.\n", "heated bed - Can a short-circuited heat bed be salvaged?": "\nWhat happend was short circuit of course.

Typically, the biggest differentiating factor between a mediocre data scientist, and a good one, is based on the hypothesis they put forth. Therefore, understanding where the cost of filament is derived from is much more important than analyzing the market price equilibrium over a period of time (Even if done with consideration to various filament types).\nHere are some basic costs:\n\nRaw material (the cost based on region, and grade)\nManufacturing scale (Mixers, extruders, cooling, spooling, packaging, etc.)\nShipping (Often 50% of cost for small quantities)\nSupply chain (Number of middle men)\n\nWithout going into detail of every preceding point, I was able to break down costs to a theoretical $10/kg for ABS, if starting with virgin pellets, and shipping flat rate USPS within the US. \nThe point that I am trying to make is, fundamentals over technical analysis in this case.\n", "extruder - Would appreciate advice on unclogging hot end [Makerbot Replicator v2]": "\nFor molten filament to jam at the inlet to the thermal barrier tube like shown here, there must be something wrong with the cooling in your setup. The cold zone needs to be cool for the extruder to work right. It looks like the cold zone is not staying below the glass point of the plastic, so the filament softens and mashes into a jam. \nHere are some common causes of jamming in Replicator 2 extruders:\n\nPrinter's environment is too hot. If it's in a hot garage, move it indoors. If you have it inside an enclosure or cabinet, open it up to let it breathe. All-metal extruders with PLA are very sensitive to ambient temp. \nNot having good contact between the heatsink and the cooling bar. Normally, just bolting them together is fine, but a small amount of of thermal grease (like Arctic Silver) smeared over the contact surface can help too.\nNot having the fan pointed the right way. You want the fan to blow ONTO the heatsink: this provides more turbulent flow and better cooling. This means you should not see the fan sticker when everything is assembled.\nFan dying and and spinning too slow. A new fan can be a good idea. (24v fans only!) Or you can try gently peeling off the fan sticker and adding a single drop of light oil (like 3-in-one) to the bearing, then re-attaching the sticker.\nUsing non-stock thermal barrier tubes that do not have the correct internal geometry. Lots of people sell bad tubes that don't have the \"secret sauce\" (internal diameter step). The four good vendors I'm aware of for this part are Makerbot, Carl Raffle, Micro Swiss, and Performance 3D. \n\"Floating\" the thermal barrier threads by tightening jam nuts on both top and bottom of the cooling bar. All-metal extruder designs require good contact pressure between the thermal barrier tube threads and the cooling bar, to ensure maximum heat transfer. The best approach is to put one jam nut below the bar to forcibly push the thermal barrier tube threads into the cooling bar, and no nut on top. (Using just one nut on top is better than two nuts, but worse than one nut below.)\n\nIt's also possible that there is some material partially blocking the nozzle, which is contributing to molten plastic backup up and jamming. \nWhat I would recommend right now is removing both the nozzle and thermal barrier tube from the printer, and either replacing them or fully cleaning them out. There are multiple options. You can preheat the hot end with the cooling bar in a vise or on a metal surface with no fans attached, to heat up the plastic in the thermal barrier tube and allow you to push the blockage through with a small allen key. Then do something to REALLY clean it out, like nylon cold-pulls, or cooking the parts in a blue flame such as a torch or gas stove. Then check for internal debris with something like a toothpick. \nOnce you can see through the nozzle orifice and there's no junk inside anything, reassemble everything properly and try again. \n", "cad - Choose infill percentage": "\nI don't believe that slicing engines create any sort of solid model that would be useful for CAD simulation. When a slicing engine slices a 3D model, it's goal is to spit out the preferred machine paths in G-Code (of some kind). However, I've read a few articles, done some tests, and heard through the grape vine that anywhere between 10%-35% is good enough for most applications. I once watched a webinar for understanding the new MakerWare interface that explained how they chose such settings. Although I can't find the clip directly, here is the page for all of MakerBot's webinars. I think this webinar was the one I watched explaining a little bit about preferred infill percentages.\nFrom experience, anything over 35% doesn't yield much more strength from infill side of things. Beyond 35% and you're going to want to reconsider how you're orienting the print when you print it and what you're printing to utilize the grain structure for proper strength.\nHowever, infill percentage/patterns are not the only variable for creating strong parts. Infill is really just a way to save time and material. Here are some other ways to potentially increase strength:\n\nIncrease your shell. Shell is the number of profile patterns per layer. Typically (in FDM/FFF), each shell is about the diameter of your extruder nozzle.\nIncrease your floor/roof. Similar to shell, floor/roof refers to the number of layers that make up the \"bottom\" and \"top\" of the part with regard to the build plate.\nPrint orientation. Pay attention to which areas of the part are susceptible to strain along the \"grain\" of the layers. Try to rotate your part on the build plate in a way that minimizes potential failure both in print and post-print use.\nPost process. Don't be afraid to do some post-processing to increase the strength. There are some 3D printers on the market that go as far as including Kevlar strands in the printing process to beef up their prints. However, it may be as simple as just coating the part in an epoxy with some basic finishing techniques. It's a bit more work, but it turns weak 3D printed parts into full production quality prints.\n\nUpdate:\nBased on some of the comments, it sounds like your best bet might be to find a custom application that can either convert the g-code file into a solid model (try CAM software?), or create a plugin for your CAD software (I know Unigraphics NX and Solidworks allow for this) and essentially recreate your own slicing engine that takes your solid model and generates the same infill pattern dynamically inside.\nPerhaps look into the works of Simlab or similar which has a lot of 3D software plugins. I'm not promoting them and I don't work for them, this is just a reference of what to look for.\n", "ruggedised printer - What are the modifications on this Kossel?": "\nCool you placed my Kossel Mini on Stackexchange!\nWhat I have modified to the standard kit:\n\nRetractable probe using RC Marlin (Rich Cattels Marlin with auto bed probe functionality).

It uses a round wheel and it drives the filament over 1/4 of the diameter of the wheel, so there is a 3 to 4\u00a0cm area where the belt drives the filament.\n\nAdvantages: \n\nLots of retracts don't \"eat\" into the filament causing feed issues\nDoesn't flatten the filament. Keeps it nice and round.\n\nDisadvantages (at this moment):\n\nNot possible/ very hard to do filament swaps on the fly (to experiment with multicolor prints).\nFirst time assembly can be a head ache, once you have it assembled it really works and is easy going.\n\nAnd last but not least. I made a foldable Roll holder.\nIt is mounted on top by two M8 screws with knobs. When I am done I undo these two screws, fold in the roll holder and it is then mounted to the side of the flight case. This way I can transport printer and roll holder carrying it only using 1 hand. So I use the other hand carrying the bag with accessories like rolls of filament, 3D spray, tweezers etc.\nMaybe this info helps other people new to 3D printing improve their printers, or enables them to bring printers more easily to meets and events to inspire others to build more Delta printers. As it's just mesmerizing to see them print.

And to accelerate and decelerate a motor under load, you need to finely vary their timing.  Back when I/O ports hung directly off processor buses, and operating systems could not prevent programs from speeding up the system hardware timer in order to run a stepper routine rapidly, this worked to a degree.  But today:\n\nMost PC class processors have little, if any directly coupled I/O - especially by the time you get outside the box.  An interface like USB is great for moving a large amount of data per unit time, but it is absolutely horrible for accomplishing a trivial task with precise, frequent timing - it is a freight train, not a bicycle courier.  Many of the things which let a processor internally operate quickly specifically work by decoupling it from an outside world that often cannot keep up - memory caches, bus exchange units, etc.  If you do find a parallel port today, it is likely to be on the far side of a PCI bus bridge at the least, and have a different low-level interface than a legacy one.\nModern operating systems have a time-slice scheduler which \"owns\" the CPU(s) and hands out small chunks of processing time to ordinary programs.  These programs typically get to run often enough to appear responsive to the user, but not frequently enough to accurately drive stepper motors.  There are various schemes which have been tried, for example to create a \"hard real time\" scheduler which owns the processor, and allows a motor control task to register for precisely needed time slices - then, with whatever time is left over a Linux or Windows or similar kernel is allowed to run, and divide up the remaining time among ordinary programs through its scheduling rules.  Of course, such a scheme tends to need to be revised each time the utilized conventional operating system has a new major release.\n\nWhile there are ways around these issues, they tend to require atypical hardware and deep changes to the operating system installation - making them neither inexpensive nor easy to setup for end users.\nInstead, it is generally simpler and more cost effective (not even $10 these days) to put an embedded processor on an external circuit board, and have it act as a delegate to execute precise-timing tasks on behalf of the host processor.  Somewhat extending from the idea of industrial CNC machines that originally read punched paper tape, and were later updated with a scheme where an ordinary computer \"drip feeds\" G-code commands over a serial port, modern 3D Printers tend to deliver G-code (or other) command data a little bit in advance of when it is needed, so that the latency of a USB or serial connection doesn't really matter.  Normally enough data is buffered on the printer for it to keep running, but even if not it would only pause briefly between the complete moves which are transmitted, not experience motor stuttering as it would if the USB were trying to deliver each individual step pulse.\nAs for why an Arduino - probably mostly the history of who built the machines which kicked off the enthusiast printing trend.  If someone from an industrial background were tasked with building something like an FDM printer or a machine with similar motion needs in isolation today, chances are they would end up with an ARM processor that would be a bit faster, more flexible, and with more resources, and likely cost a little less.  But in actual history, the early affordable machines were built by those in maker community, who were already familiar with the availability of the Arduino, and willing to put some cleverness into getting good motion out of its limitations.  RAMPS in particular seems designed to be a coarse-pitch through-hole bridge that a hobbyist could build themselves, and then buy the slightly trickier to work with surface mount processor and motor drive chips preassembled in the form of an Arduino Mega and stepper drive modules.  That even fairly propriety machines maintain these basic parts choices is probably an indication of the utility of not \"reinventing the wheel\" - if you want to develop a printer, you can start from available components and customize them only one by one as you choose, rather than not being able to run your development prototype until you get a working circuit board designed and fabbed, a working software base developed, etc.\n", "3d design - Pushing Text into surface": "\nDefinitely you have to perform substract operation.\nTake a look here\nExtrude text and then substract it from the object to etch in.\n", "electronics - What does it mean for step and dir \"to be on their own ports\"?": "\nA \"port\" for the AVR microcontroller is a set of eight IO pins that are controlled together at a hardware level. The underlying machine code can write an entire byte to set the status of all 8 pins at once. So in principle, all the step pins on the RAMBO board can be triggered exactly simultaneously. \nThe Arduino IDE hides this behavior from firmwares by abstracting the port's byte handling as a function call for each individual pin. That means programmers only have to know the Arduino PIN number, not which port and position on the processor is being used. And then the modern firmwares typically used by RAMBO do a further layer of abstraction to make it easy for the same firmware to be used by different boards, by changing pin assigned names in a config file (usually pins.h) and not assuming any specific port selection was made during board design.\nThere's no guarantee for open-source firmware that a particular pin selection was made in hardware. Lots of 3D printer controller boards even have pretty dumb pin assignments, like using hardware-PWM-capable pins for stepper signals rather than PWM'd heaters. Marlin and Repetier have chosen flexibility over performance optimization in this regard. They pretty much let the board designer use any pin for anything. When they have to do stuff like run heater PWM control or fire a bunch of step pulses as fast as possible, they emulate that in software rather than taking advantage of specific hardware that isn't always available. \nIn this specific case, there may not actually be all that much performance gain/loss. Writing to an output pin is pretty fast. The amount of time difference between firing a few step pulses in sync or firing them sequentially is on the order of a few microseconds. That won't make any difference to the motion fidelity of the printer's physical drivetrains. Somebody involved in the RAMBO design just thought it could be useful, and put a reference to it on the Wiki page (in the very first upload!) and it's never been clarified or removed from the Wiki page in the years since. \n", "Print contaminated by chips of previous filament colors": "\nMy bet is your extruder knurls are scratching the filament.

It's sticked on one side. When air goes from the pipe (goes up) then rubber is slack so the air can flow. When you suck then rubber seals the pipe.\n[edit]\nYou can find such solution in for example bike pumps, inflatable matterss pumps also gas masks and so on. It's pretty fine for low pressure. \nOf course ball valves are also widely use but then such device has to have \"rubber\" ball nest so ball lies on the rubber ring to seal it. There has to be a spring to tight the ball to the ring. Without such spring turning the device upside down would cause the valve would not work at all.\nBall solutions are intended to higher pressure.\nPlease note the spring which tights a ball creates kinda threshold on the pressure level which means that pressure has to exceed a spring force to reduce a pressure. This doesn't occure in rubber valve.\nI don't know what device you are trying to prototype but I'm pretty sure a rubber valve will be just fine.\nPlease also note that sealing surface is very low in ball valve solution but in rubber valve it can be almost unlimited so it can seal quite well even when the surface is not perfect.\n", "3d design - Preview 3d printing process": "\nYou may wish to consider Craftware for your purposes.

Here's a few things to look out for:\n\nIs your extruder temperature appropriate for the material? Typical printing temperatures can range anywhere from 200 - 225\u00a0\u00b0C for PLA (depending on the supplier). Often, if the extruder is too hot, the material will bubble or over extrude.\nIs the material of proper quality? There's a reason MakerBot Industries wants you to use their filament (besides putting their hands in your pocket book), and that is repeatability. They've tested their filament on their hardware and ensured that the material will extrude with regular print settings.\nIs the material being stored properly? Sometimes people forget to store PLA in a dry place to avoid absorbing moisture in the filament. If moisture is absorbed, it can perform poorly in the print. Indications of moisture can include a slight steam from the extruder and/or bubbles in the extruded material (similar to overheating).\nAre the fans operating correctly? If the fans aren't running or aren't running enough, the filament begins to heat further up the extrusion assembly (closer to the drive gear) which can inhibit extrusion. I know that MakerWare/MakerBot Desktop has been updated lately with more emphasis on controlling fans for active cooling, so make sure that your fan(s) are operating for duration of the print as necessary.\n\nAll and all, your filament is getting too hot. If you can't determine the sudden change, consider printing with a lower extruder temperature from now on. However, if you're using MakerBot filament (or similar quality) then I would definitely verify that your machine is calibrated, wires are fully connected, and settings are double checked. If all is as expected, then you should call MakerBot support (since they're closed source now, they technically have an obligation to help you) especially since the machine is so new.\n", "What is a good book to read about 3D printers?": "\nYou can learn a lot just by reading the forums.

This is quite high, the wires that came with your stepper motor are probably in the range of 0.1 Ohm/meter. If you had a stepper running at 2A, you'd waste 28W of power in a meter of breadboard rails.\nThankfully you're only going to be dealing with a very short stretch of breadboard (wasting \"only\" 0.8W for 4 wires over a 3 pin stretch each). It would probably be OK, but it's not ideal. Make sure the connection is good (and keep an eye on it initially) as a bad connection can result in significantly higher resistance and that might generate enough to melt your breadboard and short things out.\nA better way of doing this would be to simply solder the wires together, or (if you don't want to permanently connect the steppers) use the pin headers you mentioned, and solder them together directly (for example on a piece of perfboard or perhaps just link them up directly with a few pieces of thick wire).\n", "raspberry pi - OctoPi (Octoprint) time lapse quality issues": "\nThat bitrate is pretty low, which might explain the blockiness (is that a word?).\nFrom YouTube's upload guidelines, you are encoding at the minimum recommended bitrate for standard 720P video.

Delamination or edge/corner cracking is caused by warping stresses when the first layer adhesion is stronger than the interlayer bonding. Or it happens when the heated build plate allows a strong non-warping foundation to be built until the print is too tall to be adequately warmed by the plate. In either case, the corners of the first layer can't lift, so the print cracks elsewhere to relieve the stress. \nAll ABS warping stress, in turn, is caused by the repeated thermal contraction of the fresh plastic layer at the top of the print. The FDM process sticks hot, expanded plastic onto cool, contracted plastic. When the new layer cools, it tries to contract, but it's stuck to a layer that is already fully cooled/contracted. This generates a large shear stress between the two layers. The accumulation of those shear stresses over many consecutive layers generates a large-scale bending force on the entire print. That's what causes both warping and delamination. \n\nThe less the previous layer cools below the glass point of the plastic, the less thermal contraction it experiences before the next layer goes down, and therefore the less warping stress will accumulate as the next layer cools.\nEnvironment temp is the biggest thing you can control:\n\nIf your printer's environment is below 35C, you probably shouldn't even bother printing ABS. \nA 50C environment is significantly better and will have minimal problems with warping and delamination. This is within the ambient temp ratings of most motors and electronics. Air-cooled extruders can typically extrude ABS reliably up to about 60C ambient, at which point they may be prone to clogging. And don't forget about plastic structural parts in your printer.\nIndustrial ABS printers with heated build chambers print ABS in a 75-85C environment, with lots of airflow. In terms of cooling regimes, ABS in an 80C chamber acts very similar to PLA in a room-temp environment. No warping, but lots of airflow required for good detail. \n\nPrinting ABS at a higher nozzle temperature (say 240-250C) will also improve layer adhesion so delamination is less likely to occur. The same warping stresses will be there, but the layer bonding may be stronger than the internal stresses in the part so it survives printing.\n", "Why does my PLA filament form a spiral shape and clog my extruder?": "\nThe shape you get is quite easy to explain. It's the shape of the lowest energy possible in your situation. Simple but it doesn't explain the issue... or does it?\nIt does. The filament cannot be put into the extruder as it becomes plugged. This leads us to some obvious explanations. You can read this post.\nSo how is that possible that there is enough room to form such corkscrew? My bet is you don't have teflon pipe inside the extruder heatsink. So filament goes into the heatsink and everything is ok until the heatsink itself warms up to the temperature when filament becomes soft, then there is no enough force to push the filament out of the nozzle so above the nozzle filament bends and forms the shape of the lowest energy as said.\nOptions to check:\n\nTake your extruder apart. See if there is a teflon pipe. If its length is proper. \nCheck if cooling fan is working well, if it's pushing air to the heatsing but not sucks from the heatsink.\n\n[edit]\nLooking closer to your photos I'm pretty sure you don't have such teflon pipe.

How much spread is there in the trigger position? Do environmental changes or machine setting changes affect the trigger position?\nContact distance: does the switch register with enough clearance to its hard-stop that the homing axis can stop before colliding with something?\nNoise-rejection: does the switch ONLY trigger when it is supposed to? \n\nIt's important to ask, how much switch precision do we actually need? A typical 3d printer drivetrain using a microstepping stepper motor can only accurately position the moving load within +/- one 1/16th microstep (even if using finer microstepping than that) due to error-inducing effects like friction torque and magnetic detent angle error. That's around +/-0.01mm for most printers. The homing switch only needs to be as precise as the motor's positioning! Nothing is gained by having, say, 0.001mm precision endstops. \nThis precision of +/-0.01mm is achievable for all types of endstop switches, with proper switch selection and configuration. \nThen there are three \"standard\" switching types in use in consumer/hobbyist 3d printers:\n\nMechanical switches, typically dual NO/NC limit switches, which either pull up or pull down a signal pin by connecting an electrical circuit when triggered\nOptical switches, which use transistors to detect when an obstacle (\"flag\") is blocking the window between the emitter and sensor\nHall effect switches, which use transistors to detect when a magnetic field exceeds a particular field strength cutoff\n\nMechanical Switches\nPrecision/repeatability depends on the switch quality, length of lever arm attached (longer increases contact distance but is worse for precision), and impact speed of the carriage with the switch. It's possible to have a good mechanical switch or a bad mechanical switch. This is typically a reasonable default choice because it is simple and cheap. \nA small mechanical switch with a short lever arm (or the lever arm removed) will generally achieve the required +/-0.01mm switching precision. Very cheap switches, high contact speeds, and long lever arms may provide inadequate resolution for Z homing or probing, but will still be adequate for low-precision X and Y homing purposes. \nWhere mechanical switches tend to cause issues is in noise rejection. Different controller boards use different ways of wiring the switch: some use two wires and only send a signal when triggered. When not triggered, the signal wire is left floating or weakly pulled up by the microcontroller, while attached to a long wire that acts as an antenna to pick up EM noise. It is VERY common for heater or stepper wiring to emit nasty EMR due to the PWM current control. Two-wire endstop cables should always be run away from stepper and heater wiring. Shielding and twisting the conductors is a good idea too. \nA more robust approach is to use three-wire switches that actively pull the signal line high or low depending on the switch position. These will tend to reject noise better. \nVery cheap mechanical switches may fail within the life of the printer. However, most limit switches are rated for millions of cycles, which is unlikely to occur over any normal printer's lifespan. \nMechanical switches are easy to align and easy to trigger by hand during troubleshooting. \nOptical Switches\nThese rely on a flag blocking a window between a light emitter and a detector. This is non-contact and can be quite reliable, but introduces some challenges. The exact trigger position (and thus precision) may depend on ambient light levels in the room, because the sensor is monitoring for light to decrease below a specific intensity. So it may be very repeatable/precise in the short term but have some drift if the sensor moves in and out of the sun through the day.\nSwitching tends to be more consistent and reliable if the flag enters the window from the side, rather than the top. \nOptical switches will actively pull the signal line high or low, and thus have good electrical noise rejection.\nHall Effect Switches\nThese measure the intensity of the nearby magnetic field and trigger when it exceeds a certain amount in a certain polarity. This is highly precise/repeatable (better than +/-0.01mm) and extremely resistant to noise and environmental conditions. (Unless your printer is next to something that emits large magnetic fields, anyway.) \nThe hall switches I've seen have an adjustable trim pot to tune the trigger distance. That's a nice feature when trying to manually calibrate a Delta or a Z-bed for first layer height. \nThe primary downside to hall switches is that they need a magnet to trigger the switch. This can be difficult to trigger by hand during troubleshooting, and requires attaching a magnet somewhere on the moving carriage. Glue works fine... but don't glue the magnet in place backwards!\n", "software - Slicer/Printer Origin": "\nDepending on what kind of printer you have, the build table origin and slicer origin (0,0) are usually either the front left corner, or the center of the build plate. This can be changed by the end-user in most open-source printers. There is no standard or requirement for a particular origin location. The important thing is merely that the slicer and printer coordinate systems match, so parts actually come out where your slicer thinks they should. \nIn practice, it's usually quite easy to tell what's \"front\" in your slicer's build volume. When you open the program, the bed usually appears as it does when you stand in front of your printer. It is rarely an issue. \nIn terms of difficulty removing prints from the bed, a removable build plate is an excellent solution. Plastic has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than most build plate materials (like glass), so throwing the print+plate in your freezer will generate large separation forces and help remove the part for you. Non-removable build surfaces are a deal-breaker for most serious 3D printer users I know.

There are no printable thermoplastics available to consumers/hobbyists that will reliably AND safely contain coffee/tea temperature beverages. \nEven though some plastics may appear mechanically suitable at first sight, there are long-term issues with using thermoplastics for elevated temperature service. The material becomes weaker and less dimensionally stable under load as the temperature approaches the glass point of the polymer. For example, here is some Stratasys test data for ABS strength versus temperature:\n\nEven if the plastic survives a few uses, it may creep and warp over time. And that might be fine, depending on your needs! People have printed working coffee cups out of ABS before. For some definition of \"working\" you can make print a working coffee mug. It's just not going to work at the level of longevity and reliability that people typically expect from hot beverage containers. (Imagine if the handle breaks and pours scalding liquid in your lap.) PLA in particular tends to give out abruptly due to its unusual ability to creep to ultimate failure with very low elongations.\nThen there is the question of whether ANY FDM printed part is ever safe for repeated food service use. One-time uses (such as throw-away cookie cutters) might be perfectly fine, but repeated use introduces additional problems because FDM parts are porous. They contain a microscopic void/grain structure that is perfect for trapping food debris and sheltering bacteria. Every FDM part is similar in that regard to an old, scratched, wooden cutting board. They are difficult to effectively sanitize. A high-temp dishwasher cycle will do the job, but that imposes significant thermal stress on thermoplastics. \nHere's an example micrograph I took of voids in a printed part (strands all aligned the same way to highlight the shape):\n\nThese voids will also allow liquids to leak unless careful print settings are used. Over-extruding with multiple perimeters, or doing some kind of post-print sealing can make water-tight parts. It's not hard, just takes some experimenting. \nThere is also considerable anecdotal evidence that much of the cheap filament from Asia is full of nasty, toxic substances that may leach into hot beverages. Heavy metals like lead, strontrium, and cadmium are often found in thermoplastics as processing aids, pigments, or simply from unscrupulous companies disposing of industrial ashes by mixing them into dark-colored filaments for export. US-made and EU-made filaments seem to be better in this regard. \nNow that the basic issues are out of the way... Here is the breakdown of specific materials you might want to try:\n\nPLA blends used in 3d printing will soften and fail almost instantly on contact with hot beverages. (They contain melt-reducers and viscosity modifiers and polymer molecular weights specific to FDM filament and will perform differently from injection-molded PLA products.) It is possible to anneal PLA to survive higher temperatures, as this increases the crystallinity of the polymer and thus makes it more heat-stable. However, that is highly experimental and results will vary considerably with filament provider, color/pigment, and annealing process used. Even annealed PLA is unlikely to survive long-term against very hot beverages and dishwasher use.\nABS will become fairly weak at hot beverage temperatures. It may survive use for a while, but is quite weak and will slowly creep with very hot beverages or in a high-temp dishwasher. ABS IS approved for food use in many contexts, despite what many people think, but hot beverages are not one of the approved uses.\nPET blends are chemically a pretty good choice -- soda bottles are PET -- but generally have glass points around 70-75C and thus will be weak or fail outright at hot beverage temperatures. It is also important to ask what is being blended into the PET. For example, PETG is \"glycol modified\" but filament vendors do not share any details about this or reveal how it may affect the polymer's leaching behavior.\nMost nylons will creep under load at surprisingly low temperatures, perhaps 50-55C depending on the blend. Nylons are also attacked by acids and will absorb stains and smells from coffee. Nylons also tend to swell/shrink quite dramatically on exposure to water, so mechanical fit and general shape of nylon parts may not be stable enough even for cold beverage service. Taulman's 910 is probably a good candidate for hot beverage service due to its high working temperature, but acid attack from coffee exposure may still be an issue in the long run. It's worth trying. \nPolycarbonate is thermally stable even in boiling water, so mechanically it is fine, but PC leaches BPA (one of the monomers left over from manufacture) into hot liquids. \nHigh-temp exotics like Ultem and PEEK aren't printable by consumer/hobbyist printers at the size scale required for a coffee mug. They simply warp too much unless you have an oven for a heated build chamber. \n\nIn summary, you can make a working coffee mug via FDM printing, but it isn't a great idea. Your best bet for 3d printing a coffee mug is ordering ceramic printed from an online service bureau.\n", "prusa i3 - What is causing these artifacts when the extruder moves in one direction?": "\nIn case of such difference in printing in different directions you can check if;\n\nfor x and partially z axis\n\n\nfilament is blocked and cannot be pulled as it should\nspool is blocked\n\nfor x and y axis\n\n\nrods on which caret/HB is sliding are parallel\ntiming belt idlers are parallel and they are in a line\n\n\nShape of the nozzle or its perpendicularity should not be the case as it's hot and it wipes layer itself.\nYou can also check if it's not an issue of cooling fan.

Temp limit reached": "\nIt sounds like a failed TC amp chip. But we need to rule out some other stuff. \nSome important facts about the Creator Pro temp sensor:\n\nIf you smash and short the two thermocouple wires together, the printer will simply read room temp.\nIf you cut or disconnect the thermocouple wires, the printer will report NC for \"not connected.\"\nThe thermocouple lookup table in the firmware only goes up to 300C. \n\nSeeing a number over 300C means either a bad thermocouple amp chip, or excess voltage on the TC wires due to a short to something else in the hot block. (However, such a short will usually fry the entire controller board to smithereens.)\nTo rule out stray voltage entering the TC wires, completely detach both thermocouples from the hot blocks and lay them out not touching anything metal. Do you still get an unusually high reading on tool 0? \nTo rule out an issue with the specific thermocouple, swap thermocouples between tool 0 and tool 1 and see if the problem moves with the TCs.\nIf the TC is not touching anything, and the problem stays with the tool when you swap wires, and you STILL get >300C reads, the thermocouple amp chip has failed. It is possible to replace the chip if you have (or your friend has) a hot air rework station and some experience soldering. Or you can get a new mainboard from FlashForge. \nThe next question is why this problem happened. You don't want to fix the symptoms with new parts but have an underlying issue cause the same failure to re-occur after you swap out parts. With the printer on but the heaters off, use a multimeter to check for voltage between the hot block and the printer's ground. Certain types of heater cartridge failure can short the hot block to +24v. This is highly dangerous and needs to be fixed before you continue using the printer. So make sure you check it before trying to repair anything else. \n", "heated bed - Would a steel, instead of an aluminium, plate be reasonable?": "\nWhether you should use steel or aluminum depends on the construction of your print bed stack. Either will work, but there are trade-offs involved.\nVarious considerations that may come into play:\n\nA flat sheet of aluminum has better stiffness/weight ratio than a flat sheet of steel. If weight/mass is a concern, such as with a Mendel style moving Y-bed, aluminum may be superior to an equivalent stiffness steel sheet. On the other hand, steel has the superior stiffness/thickness ratio, so if the total thickness of the plate is constrained, such as by the printer's mounting hardware, steel may be higher performance. In short, for sheets of equivalent stiffness, aluminum will be thicker but lighter. That may or may not matter for your specific printer. \nDifferential thermal expansion can be an issue, depending on what the plate is attached to. For example, rigidly bolting a steel sheet to an aluminum sub-frame will cause the structure to warp when its temperature changes. Likewise for bolting an aluminum sheet to a steel sub-frame. Bed mounts that \"float\" will not cause warping in either case. \nAll kinds of rolled sheet metal may have a tendency to warp when heated/cooled, due to residual stresses and grain alignment effects from manufacture. When people want extreme dimensional stability for the flattest and lowest-warp print bed possible, an aluminum cast tooling plate material such as MIC 6 is usually used. The MIC 6 sheet is then precision ground to be flat. Of course, that adds cost. \nNeither aluminum nor steel is a particularly good bare print surface. Either will need some kind of adhesion layer, like Kapton tape or gluestick. The adhesion layer matters far more than the type of metal underneath.\nAluminum sheets are often used as heat-spreaders to even out the bed temperature of heated beds. This is very important when heaters are smaller than the total bed size, or have hot spots. (Most heaters do have hot spots.) Steel is a relatively poor conductor of heat, so the surface of the bed will take longer to heat up and will be less even. That may or may not be an issue, depending on the printer and desired materials. \n\nSo, it's really a holistic design decision. Aluminum is far more common because of its thermal properties and lower weight, but steel print beds (particularly with permanent adhesion coatings) are often used too. \n", "How to choose printer with dual extruder?": "\nAs you suggest yourself, ordering test prints of some model is one way to do it. \n3D Hubs and MakeXYZ allows you to get your model printed by hobbyists and small businesses for a fair price.

Similarly, on MakeXYZ, search local makers for your desired printer.\n", "software - Extrusion adjustment": "\nSHORT ANSWER\nYou're not supposed to do the single-wall perimeter thickness test to calibrate Simplify3D. That screws up the extrusion volume. The correct volume calibration procedure for S3D is: \n\nMeasure actual average filament diameter and input that\nPrint a 100% infill calibration cubes\nIf the print is over-extruded (top or sides bulging), decrease Extrusion Multiplier by about 0.05 and try again. If the print is under-extruded or looks clean, increase Extrusion Multiplier by about 0.05 and try again.\nRepeat as needed to dial it in. The correct value of Extrusion Multiplier is the largest value that does not produce over-extruded prints. This produces minimum void volume and strong parts.\nIn the future, that specific material+extruder combination will always have the same extrusion multiplier. You only need to measure and input filament diameter and you will always get accurate volume output. (And if you use high-quality filament with consistent diameter, you don't even really need to measure the diameter.)\n\nIf you really want to measure perimeters, you can do 3 perimeters and divide the measurement by 3. That takes into account most of the overlap and will be much closer to accurate than a single-perimeter measurement.\nCOMPLETE ANSWER\nThe goal here is to fill the print volume as completely as possible (at least in the \"solid\" parts of the print like perimeters, roofs, and floors). Empty space between strands doesn't contribute to part strength. In fact, voids act as failure initiation sites by concentrating stresses. Because extruded strands come out with rounded edges, they have to be overlapped to squeeze plastic into gaps and minimize \"corner voids.\" That looks like this:\n\nWhere the bulges overlap, the excess plastic gets pushed into the corners to mostly fill the voids. It's very difficult to get 100% packing density, but you can get pretty close if you calibrate volume correctly.\n\nYou DO NOT want to space the strands without overlap. That makes very weak prints and looks like this:\n\nTo get the right amount of strand overlap, the slicer has to do some math and make some assumptions about how you're calibrating it. This is not uniform between software packages. So it's important to understand what \"extrusion width\" means to different slicers. For a couple prominent examples:\n\nSlic3r treats \"extrusion width\" as the measured outside dimension of a stack of strands. Adjacent strands are then positioned closer together than the nominal width according to a somewhat complicated equation to get sufficient overlap for bonding.\nS3D treats \"extrusion width\" as the average width of the stack of strands, which is the equivalent width if the plastic strands were extruded as ideal rectangles instead of a stack of ovals. Adjacent strands are positioned 1x nominal extrusion width apart. That provides the correct amount of overlap without any extra math. But each individual strand is really somewhat wider than the nominal \"width.\"\n\n\nBoth of these techniques can produce the exact same output if calibrated properly, but they require different calibration techniques because they calculate the plastic volume and adjacent strand spacing different ways. \nIt's important to understand that S3D spaces its strands 1x extrusion width apart. When you use the measured perimeter thickness to calibrate Simplify3D for extrusion width setting = measured thickness, you get under-extruded prints with no strand overlap. S3D's strands must measure wider than the \"width\" setting to get the correct overlap. \nIn practice, S3D's code is smart enough to know how this affects print dimenions, and will adjust perimeter positions to get accurate overall dimensions. But single-wall test boxes will be thicker than expected. \nThe downside to the way Slic3r calculates volume is that it is only accurate for strands that are shaped like ovals. And that is only an accurate assumption when [extrusion width > nozzle width + layer height]. The strand must be wide enough for molten plastic to flow sideways and develop the circular bulge cross-section. So people almost always print with wider strands in Slic3r than is strictly necessary. The volume calculations don't work all that well with thin strands. Whereas S3D's volume calculation method works fine with pretty much any extrusion width greater than layer height and greater than nozzle diameter. \nThere are pros and cons to both systems. You just need to understand the correct calibration technique for each. \n", "rsin - Pros to UV printing - 3D Printing Stack Exchang": "\nWhen using a DLP 3D printer, a projector (or other UV light source) is shining on a layer of resin.  As the light source shines on a whole layer at a time, it is able to print at a rather constant linear vertical rate. This rate is normally around 2.5\u00a0cm (1\u00a0inch)/hour\nWhen comparing this to a standard FDM printer or a single laser system (such as the Pegasus Touch. The printer takes more time on more complicated layers. If a you were able to print the same 2.5\u00a0cm (1\u00a0inch), at 0.3\u00a0mm layer height, it would be a total of ~85 layers. This would allow for ~42 seconds per layer. Most layers would take longer from this (from personal experience).\nWith the constant layer rate, multiple objects can also be printed at once because if the printer has to print the layer for the first object, it is not taking more time for it to cure resin in another location on the print bed.\nIn addition to this, DLP printers can have much better resolutions than FDM printers.  A DLP printer such as the Titan 1 has a 37\u00a0\u03bcm XY resolution while a Prusa i3 has a resolution closer to 300 or 400\u00a0\u03bcm.\n", "3d design - Is this model feasible to print?": "\nHere is a set of options you can get:\n\nprint the object on multi color printer\n\nUnfortunately we got some limitations here (on the market).

If you include several grooves in the bottom surface of your model that may provide some \"strain relief\" so-to-speak, preventing warping.\nIncrease adhesion: print your initial layer slower, closer to the build surface, at a higher temperature, with a brim, and with some kind of print surface to increase adhesion (tape/glue/hairspray).\nIncrease ambient temperature. The Replicator 2 does not have a heated bed, but you could still make the cooling more gradual by enclosing the printer, shielding it from drafts, etc...\n\n", "SLS 3D printer to DMLS 3D printer": "\nBy just changing powder: No.\nChanging the powder, the laser and the chamber, maybe you can get something, but it's not recommended.\nDMLS machines use a sealed chamber with a flow of Argon, Nitrogen, or other gas to prevent oxidation of metal powder (and avoid fire or explosions).\nLaser power for metal needs to be of higher power than that used por polymer laser sintering (SLS, SLM, LS, etc).\nBTW. DMLS also need a metallic build plate to dissipate heat.\n", "3d models - Do 3D Printers Prefer Particular Topology?": "\nThe most common file format in 3D printing is STL. This file format is using triangles only so when you export an object from your CAD application to STL then exporter has to transform all n-gon faces into triangles.\nOnce the file is created then it is usually imported by slicer application (or module) which performs slicing using polynomial calculation to find intersection with next surfaces. Here is good example of such intersection finding in javascript.\nSo answering your question:\n\nno - it doesn't matter as you usually use file format in which faces are triangles but\nyes - it matters as all your n-gon faces needs to be transformed into triangles\n\n", "slic3r - Offset in X or Y axis": "\nThere are two things which shouldn't be mixed.\n\nPosition of the object relative to its own coordinate system.\n\nIn general object doesn't have specific position stored inside. Which is obvious as structure of the object should store construction of an object but not its position. So position is relation-to-something so to speak and because object itself doesn't contain any information about object environment then there is no position stored.\nBut there is one hack. All coordinates stored inside object are in fact a realtion to some starting point. Let's say it's a zero-point or starting point of the coordinate system of the object. This is sometimes anoying because it's usually bottom left corner or center of the object. Unfortunately some applications store this starting point out of the object. This means that object has starting point in some point but this point is outside of the object itself.\nThis cause the situation when user loads an object in another application then object is translated in \"strange\" position.\n\nPosition of the object in printing application.\n\nWhen user loads an object into printing application then object is usualy set in the center of build plate. This also sounds obvious but if inner coordinate system of the object is translated then object can be repositioned even out of the build plate.\nSo what is the solution for such situation.\nThere are two options.\n\nManage object coordinate system in the application which create STL file  or convert object into STL format or\nManage (switch off) option called \"center on build plate\" or \"center on the bed\" or \"center object\" or \"auto-center parts\" in printing application.\n\nThen it will be possible (or easier) to position object according to user needs.\nAnother issue is STL object which is in fact kinda assembly of separate objects. If you encounter such situation. See here for example\n\nThese two guys are stored in one STL file so they have common coordinate system and common starting point. All above applies to such assembly.\nApplications allows user to split such assembly into separate objects so each one can be repositioned separately. But be careful - split can disassemble parts of the object itself. In the example the tounge of the trex is 3rd object in the assembly.\nIn terms of mentioned aps:\n\nReptier: go to object placement \"tab\" and set position manually\nSlic3r: go to Printer settings and set \"print center\", also you can switch off File > Preferences > Auto-center parts\nMetterControl: go to printer > print area and set print center\n\n", "3d models - Is inconsistent vertex density a bad thing?": "\nFor the most part, the exact level of vertex density doesn't matter too much. But it does depend on the slicer and settings. Some slicers (like Slic3r) will auto-decimate toolpaths to ensure that the rate of motion commands isn't too difficult for the old, slow 8bit processors in most consumer/hobbyist 3d printers. Having a large number of very small motion commands can bog down these motion controllers and cause pause-stuttering that creates little zits on the print. Most slicers simply reduce model detail level to safeguard the motion controller. Because the contours are decimated to a minimum motion segment length, very small model triangles are irrelevant to printer performance. At the most, they might add a marginal amount of slicing time. \nOn the other hand, some slicers (like Simplify3d) assume you have the correct level of detail you want in your model, and will pretty faithfully reproduce the model file's contours in the sliced toolpath. If your entire model is very high mesh density / poly count in general, or if your high-density mesh regions are crossed by a layer slice, this can produce a series of very, very short motion commands. Sometimes the motion commands are even smaller than the motion resolution of the printer, and simply take up processor time (to evaluate and drop from the queue) with no benefit to print fidelity. \nIn a more general sense, high-poly models are dramatically more difficult for the 3d printer to reproduce accurately. There are two big issues: \n\nEach motion segment requires some processor time to read/receive, parse, and execute. But the shorter the segment lengths are, the faster the printer runs through them. A short move takes little time to perform but still has the same processor load as a long move. At a certain point, the processor can't keep up, and performance suffers. The printer may run out of queued moves to execute and pause in place, or it may violate acceleration limits and violently clunk through corners (or even lose position) because it didn't have enough time to iterate through the calculations that determine how fast it should move.\nThe algorithms used by most consumer/hobbyist 3d printer firmwares (Marlin, Repetier, Sailfish, Smoothieware, etc) are based on GRBL. And without getting into the math, GRBL uses the sharpness of the corners between motion segments to decide how fast to travel through the corner. So a 90 degree turn will trigger a considerable slowdown, while a series of small angles (such as many small segments comprising a curved surface) is not recognized by the algorithm, and it will try to barrel through the curve at full speed. On long, gentle curves, this is fine, but high-poly tight curves (such as a filleted edge or organic model detail) are traversed far too fast because no slowdowns are triggered. This means high-poly models must be printed at much lower feedrates / target speeds, because the acceleration algorithm can't figure out when to go fast or slow. Whereas a blocky, low-poly model can be printed much faster and the acceleration code will speed up and slow down as needed for good quality. \n\nThese are primarily issues with high vertex density versus low vertex density, not variable density. Small pockets of high detail are usually not problematic, as long as they are small enough that the motion planner queue (say, 16 segments) doesn't get filled with too many very small movements. A few small segments in a row is ok, but a few dozen is not. \nThese are limitations baked into the algorithms used by today's slicers and motion controllers. In the future, they may not be so problematic. \n", "sls - Hatch Distance and Scan Distance": "\nScan spacing\n\nWithin each of the \u2018islands\u2019, simple alternating scan vectors are used with the spacing between these vectors defined as the \u2018scan spacing\u2019 and the speed with which the laser spot moves across the surface defined as the \u2018scan speed\u2019. \n\n\nSource\n\nThe influence of the laser scan strategy on grain structure and cracking behaviour in SLM powder-bed fabricated nickel superalloy\nchapter: 2.2.

If there are remains - the simplest way to clean it up is to extrude 5-10 cm of new filament, which will gather all remainings clean the hotend.\nThe above concerns changing filament in the same group of plastic. So if you print PLA you can switch colors/manufacturers and so on without issues. The same goes for ABS.\nThere is also usually no problem when switching from PLA to ABS.\nThe worst scenario is to switch from ABS to PLA. This is because the extruding temperature of these two materials is different. Unfortunately ABS can have such a high melting temperature that the PLA will burn. So having a dirty hotend with ABS remainings, there is no way to extrude PLA to clean the hotend because the PLA temperature will not result in melting ABS. It can eventually lead to total plug of HE.\nSo what can you do when you are in such a situation (ABS -> PLA)?\nYou can clean the hotend first with ABS. Extrude some, wait until it is cold, ease the springs and pull or tear out the filament from the hotend.\nIf you are stuck you can use special drills to clean the nozzle.\nBut to totally omit the issue you can have two hotends :) One for ABS and one for PLA ;) But I think you can manage cleaning if you apply what I've written above.\n", "Increased issues with filament grinding": "\nI've encountered this on my Replicator Dual in the past. I was only using MakerBot branded ABS filament, so it wasn't a quality issue for me.\nWhat I found was that the delrin plunger design that \"helps\" keep the filament in contact with the drive gear wasn't actually helping. So, I installed the newer assemblies that use a spinning bearing to contact with the filament.\n\nInstall (or keep installed) a spring loaded extruder assembly.\nWhen feeding filament, loosen the spring and gradually tighten until the filament begins feeding on its own.\nTry to stay close to the recommended print temperatures for the material. ABS is typically somewhere around 225C, but it depends on the supplier.\nEnsure your filament is stored in a dry place. This is way more of an issue for PLA, but it doesn't hurt to keep your material protected.\nIf it continues, perhaps swap out the drive gear itself. If you've dropped your motor or somehow a burr has developed on any of the teeth, naturally the burr will cut away the material. Gears are very temperamental and should be considered a consumable.\n\n", "post processing - How to remove a PLA print stuck to a BuildTak sheet": "\nI would do as fred_dot_u initially suggested, by increasing the bed temp (or using a hair dryer) to heat the BuildTak. Then, use a small fan to quickly cool the platform (or at least quicker than room temperature). An ice pack on the build plate/part could also work. This drastic fluctuation between the build platform (or BuildTak) and the part should make it easier to remove the part.\nThis works because the temperature coefficient is going to be different between the build plate, BuildTak, and the 3D printed part. So, each part rises and falls in temperature at different rates. When objects are heated and cooled, they expand and contract (respectively). Essentially, as each object expands and contracts at different rates, the objects begin to separate.\nA good example is if you've ever placed a jar into the fridge/freezer to make it easier to open. Typically the jar is glass and the lid is either plastic or metal. You'll notice that the lid is significantly easier to open, as opposed to its original state, because the lid and the jar physically react differently to temperature changes.\nAlso, here is a good article explaining a few different ways to remove a stuck part. (for prosperity sake, here's a quick list):\n\nBrute force. Just try to yank on it until it pries off.\nSharp objects. Try using a small blade to get under a corner of the part and wiggle the part a bit. Careful not to break the blade and send it flying.\nUtilize temperature difference. I already explained this above.\nUse solvents. I didn't know this, but apparently there are solvents in the market that are targeted for 3D printing maintenance. Essentially its just an alcohol-based liquid...\nUse floss. Another cool idea that's related to using a sharp object, using dental floss. Basically, any small object that you can remotely wiggle under the part and give you more leverage to yank on it.\nInvest in a flexible build platform. I've personally heard some mixed reviews on these (in present day of 2016). But material science is getting better every year, so who knows what will be available soon.\n\n", "What is the least expensive 3D printer?": "\nDepends on your definition of \"available\" and your definition of \"suitable for general use.\" \nThe cheapest 3D printers are mostly Kickstarter promises that take a year or more to ship, if they ever do. For example, the Peachy 3D printer Kickstarter just imploded and failed. There have been many other failed low-cost 3D printer crowdfunding campaigns. Another low cost Kickstarter printer, the 101Hero, is ongoing now (May 2016), but most competent observers I've talked to don't believe it will succeed at delivering working printers to all backers at that price point. If they do deliver, it will be painfully low-cost components and the printer will not perform well or last long. Stay away from crowdfunding campaigns for your first printer. At best, you get a beta product with lots of kinks to work out. At worst, you get nothing and lose your money. \nFor actual products you can purchase today, there's a wide spectrum of quality/cost tradeoffs.\n\nUnder \\$200 there's nothing credible. The Tiko (\\$179) might deliver, but post-Kickstarter units are widely expected to cost more.\nAround \\$200-300 you get into low-quality Prusa i3 kits from China. These aren't a great value -- most people end up spending another few hundred dollars on upgrades to get them working reliably and with high quality.\nAround \\$300-400 you can get an ok 3D printer, often with \"chipped\" proprietary filament so the vendor can make high profits on locked-in consumables. (\"Razors and blades\" model.) For example, the XYZPrinting Da Vinci Jr is \\$350 but locks you into high-cost chipped filament. The Wanhao Duplicator i3 is currently a community favorite for value-for-money at \\$399. The Printrbot Play is much higher quality/reliability but much smaller at the same price. \nIf you get up around \\$600, a big range of decent printers opens up. But this is no longer the \"least expensive\" option, so I won't get into it. \n\nIf you want to tinker, the Duplicator i3 is a good choice. If you want a machine that just prints, the Play is a good choice. There are other printers and cheaper printers, but most of what you'll find below $400 is going to end up causing pain unless your goal is simply to tinker with printer troubleshooting and upgrades. \n", "calibration - Slic3r under extrusion": "\nIt looks like you overtune it. I think it's because top layer of hollow object doesn't have any support (which is obvious) but because of that the filament is not oblate that's why it looks like underextruded.\nIf you really need hollow object then set number of top layers to 3..5 then check if it helps. I know it's not really what you expect but IMO this could help here. (I usually set 2 bottom layers and 3 top and it's quite enought.) You can also experiment with speed of top leyer. I would say the faster the better in this issue as the the first top layer should be as flat as possible then next top layer will have better support. And of course cooling should be set to max (as for the bridges).\nHere is an explanation why you get underextrusion. \n\nA is wall (perimeter) B is (ceiling) top layer. \nEmpty outlines are what you expect but filled shapes are what you really get.

In fact, whether any particular material is approved by regulators (such as the US FDA) for food contact is much more complex than most people realize. Materials can be accepted for some uses and not others. But there are two major considerations:\n\nDoes the material leach into the food, or does the food leach into the material?\nCan the material be adequately cleaned and sterilized between repeated food exposures?\n\nWhether leaching is a concern will depend on the kind of contact. For example, nylon will absorb acids but is often used for potable water service. ABS is fine for cold foods but not hot foods. PLA (injection grade) is often used for disposable plastic forks and cold beverage cups, but rarely reusable containers. \nThere is some anecdotal evidence that lots of 3D printing filaments, particularly cheap Asian filaments, contain toxic chemicals in the pigments and additives. Heavy metals like lead, cadmium, strontium, and all sorts of nasty organic chemicals have been found. You probably WON'T get any meaningful leaching of these chemicals in the brief exposure with cookie dough, but to be safe I would only use reputable US and EU filament manufacturers for food contact. I would also stick to filament colors that use non-toxic pigments (eg plain white is almost always safe titanium dioxide) or no pigments at all (\"natural\" color). \nWhen it comes to cleaning a cookie cutter for multiple uses, ABS is probably a much better choice than PLA, because ABS can withstand fairly hot water without losing shape. PLA probably won't survive a cycle through the dishwasher. PETG is perhaps a better choice than ABS for longer contact with wet foods, but may or may not survive the dishwasher. \nHowever, the porous structure of 3D printed parts is a serious problem for cleanliness. The tiny grain structure and voids between extruded strands can act as a safe haven for bacteria between uses. This is particularly an issue with cookie dough containing raw egg. A porous surface for raw-food handling would not be acceptable in a commercial kitchen.\nNow, the odds of actually transmitting salmonella via poorly-cleaned cookie cutter may be fairly low. Lots of people cut meat at home on wooden cutting boards (which are also porous) and never get sick. Properly cooking the food immediately after handling will go a long way towards reducing the odds of harmful cross-contamination. You'll have to decide for yourself whether the risk profile is worth it. One-time use is the conservative choice. \n", "abs - Raft hard to rmov? - 3D Printing Stack Exchang": "\nA couple things to consider:\n\nEnsure that your build plate is flat and level.

This results in a slower \"cool-down rate\". So, if it takes longer for the filament to cool between the raft and the first layers of the object. Therefore, cooling together in a manner that somewhat binds them.\nPersonally, 266C seems VERY high to me. I've primarily only used ABS on my MakerBot and have successfully printed with 225C +-5C nozzle temperature and 110C +-2C HBP temperature.\nTypically you want to extrude slightly above the melting point.

But covering the top and bottom provides much of the practical benefit, and you can always add a few more wraps of Kapton tape to cover up the rest of the surfaces. \nAnother good option that has recently started to become popular is fiberglass heat shield tape. It has a silicone adhesive, woven fiberglass mat, and shiny aluminum surface. (The reflective surface reduces heat radiation.) It's often used in automotive applications around mufflers and the like. You can cut it up into little rectangles for each side of the hot block, or wrap the block similar to Kapton. \n\nhttps://shop.raffle.ch/shop/insulation_material/\nMain issue is quality -- not all brands have adhesive that will hold up to high temp printing.

The cold filament rapidly moving through your hotend will cool it down locally, meaning that the temperature will be cooler than what the thermistor measures. Faster prints equal bumps in the temperature up to 10\u00a0\u00b0C, and for a really slow print you might turn it down 10\u00a0\u00b0C from where you normally are.\n\nThis is a minor issue, but different colors of the same brand and material might work better at different temperatures. The pigments used can affect the melting point somewhat. Different brands also might have different temperatures.\n\n\nSome symptoms may give you a guide as to how to adjust your temperature:\nPrinting too hot\n\nSmall/slow prints may not solidify quickly enough, leaving you with an ugly blob.\n\nStringing/bad bridging.\n\nPlastic in the heatbreak may soften, leading to clogging.\n\nYou might burn/degrade the material (but for this you would really need to go outside of the temperature range).\n\n\nPrinting too cool\n\nToo much force required to extrude, leading so skipping/grinding of the filament drive.\n\nLayer delamination: the plastic needs to be hot enough to partially melt the layer below it and stick to it.

You may know this material is often used in cutting boards, as it cleans easily and doesn't cut easily.\nit does machine in a manner similar to aluminum, although the tool should be cooled/lubricated to prevent a build-up of melted plastic on the cutting edges. You can get away without coolant or lubricant if cutting speeds are slow and the swarf is cleared away from the cutter.\nI'd not considered such a material for constructing a 3d printer, as it's expensive, but I've also not compared the prices to equivalent sizes of aluminum. \nI'd consider that the use in a 3d printer would be a good substitute for lexan, as one can tighten the bolts without fear of cracking. For bolts subject to rotation or vibration, self-locking nuts are a good idea. If you have use of a broach, cutting out a pocket for the nuts would be easily accomplished.\nI have downloaded the plans for the open-source 3d printer known as DICE, which calls for aluminum, but the pricing I've found was excessive for the right quantities. I think I'll explore the same bill of materials in HDPE or UHMW-PE (which may be different names for the same substance).\nEqually useful to know is that the material is very slippery, effectively self-lubricating under the right conditions. Unfortunately, for a 3d printer application, I don't believe the self-lubricating part would work for carriages but might be fun to try with linear slides.\nIt is not as stiff as aluminum, so where stiffness is needed and not provided by the architecture, a thicker piece may be indicated. I can just barely bend with my fingers a piece of 3\u00a0mm (1/8\") a small amount, but cannot do so for aluminum.\nHere's the result of a quick search for UHMWPE:\nhttps://www.interstateplastics.com/Uhmw-Natural-Virgin-Sheet-UHMNV~~SH.php?thickness=0.125&dim2=12&dim3=24 which gives a price for 1/8\" white sheet 24\u00a0x\u00a012\" as US\\$\u00a026.06 while the black version is available only as thin as 1/4\" for about US$\u00a028.00\nThe equivalent size in aluminum 6061T6 at onlinemetals.com is about US\\$\u00a03.00 more expensive.

The equivalent for 1/4\" is almost US\\$\u00a060, quite a bit higher. \nIt would appear that if you need the thicker stuff, the price is better for plastic, not so good for the aluminum.\n", "3d models - Slicer that exports vectors or pics for every slice": "\nYour approach is one of many and you may find that Slic3r will do as you require.\nThere's a direct reference to generating SVG files (vector) at this link:\nhttp://manual.slic3r.org/advanced/svg-output\nYou may have to create a printer profile based on irrational figures when compared to conventional 3d printers. Your 2mm \"layer height\" should be matched in the printer settings to an appropriate nozzle diameter for the desired result.\nYou may find also that Simplify3d will create such files, but it's not a free program.\nAn alternative to 3d printer slicing software would be to use OpenSCAD to import your model (or create it directly in code) and use the Projection command to generate the individual layers. I've done this and found it works well, but the process to learning the necessary code was time consuming, as I'm not a programmer.\nYou would also want to incorporate some form of registration in your model, cylindrical holes or external tabs to enable you to properly align each cardboard layer.\nIf you have a makerspace nearby or know someone with a suitably sized laser cutter, you may also save some labor cutting each panel, as the laser will accept the vector files easily.\n", "3d design - Car Body shop Printers": "\nThe Materialise Mammoth printers seem to be the predominant choice for manufacturing car body parts. However, any sufficiently large printer (e.g. bigrep) could work. That said, car body parts are quite a challenge to 3D print given how excruciatingly long such large parts take (exacerbating the probability of failure). You will have to very carefully consider whether 3D printing is right for your application (it probably is not).\nThe licensing part is extremely complicated. You'll have to deal with patents (perhaps the body part incorporates some clever patented feature), trademarks (you generally can't reproduce manufacturer's logo's) and copyrights (if the part is very \"artistic\" it might be protected by copyright, but this is unlikely). A simple, functional part such as a body panel would generally not be protected by any of these but these three things are the main reason why you might need a license.\nIn addition, you have to be careful as to which materials you use, as these will (most probably) not be as strong/durable as those that are produced by car-parts-manufacturers. Furthermore, if you print the parts yourself, install it in a customer's vehicle, and the vehicle malfunctions, as a result, you may find yourself being sued.\n", "filament - What to do with failed/unwanted 3D prints?": "\nThe \"obvious\" answer is re-grinding the prints and making more filament. Unfortunately, this isn't yet a very economical or simple operation. A decent filament extruder capable of holding acceptable diameter tolerances is around $1000, and even then they can be pretty fidgety to operate. You have to have a LOT of volume throughput in your filament extruder for regrinding to be an economical proposition. \nSome of the reasons why recycling prints into filament can be difficult:\n\nMost plastics will degrade to some extent each time they are extruded. (Both by the 3d printer and by the filament extruder.) PLA will thermally degrade with extended exposure to heat. PET will hydrolyze and break down if not meticulously dried to remove moisture prior to heating to the melting temp. (PETG seems to be less prone to hydrolysis damage than plastic bottle PET, but it still happens to a limited degree.) ABS holds up to extrusion conditions better than most, which is part of why it's favored for injection molding, but there's still the potential to affect properties by depleting additives or cooking out plasticizers. In practice, this means regrinds generally need to be mixed with fresh pellets at some ratio. That dilutes the degraded or additive-depleted polymer with good material so you can maintain the material properties and performance. \nIf you print a variety of different colors, and don't want all your recycled filament to mix and end up a muddy brownish color, it can be difficult to manage the color sorting and matching. Most people don't want different colors along the length of a spool, either. So the regrind has to be mixed evenly in with virgin pellets and a suitable amount of masterbatch colorant to get a reasonable color output. You're not going to run off a new spool with 95% virgin pellets just to recycle a 50 gram failed print, are you? Likewise for material matching. Mixing materials is a bad idea. If you only print white PLA, this is all pretty easy to manage. But if you print a variety of colors and materials, you've got to set up a material tracking, sorting, and storage operation. You can do it... it's just a hassle. \nDiameter control is difficult. 3D printers need a fairly tight diameter control for reliable performance and good quality. This is really the key challenge in any filament extrusion process. Extruded polymers like to change shape as they extrude and cool due to molecular alignment effects. You can't just push molten plastic out a 1.75mm nozzle -- \"die swell\" will make the extrudate bulge to a larger diameter immediately upon exiting the nozzle. Then you have to actually pull on the soft filament as it cools to carefully draw it down to the right diameter. The way the filament extruder measures diameter and controls tension is the key to getting acceptable results. Most hobbyist/desktop filament extruders have not succeeded at this. \n\nThose are just the major issues. Filament extrusion is a complex subject with a lot of depth. For a home user of 3d printers, making filament basically becomes a whole second hobby. In my opinion, it only really makes sense in a commercial production printing environment where paid technicians can run the extruder(s) and a very large print throughput makes the pellets+regrind economics much more favorable than just buying new filament. \nReducing and reusing are preferable to recycling. Making your printer more reliable and gaining experience with calibration/configuration will reduce the volume of waste produced. \nThere are also some productive uses that let you reuse unwanted prints as-is or \"downcycle\" them for productive uses. \n\nI personally keep a box of failed prints (and calibration prints and\nno-longer-needed prototypes) as showpieces for people who want to\nlearn about 3D printing, and as toys for my nieces and nephews. I strongly recommend doing your calibration prints with a \"toy\" calibration model like Benchy or CaliBlocks. 3D printing is still new enough that people will happily take dozens of Benchies off your hands for the novelty value.\nFailed and unwanted prints can also be used around the workshop for shims, sacrificial\ncushions when clamping or hammering or drilling, or as scrap for experimenting\nwith adhesives or post-processing techniques.\nABS scraps are good for making ABS-slurry as a print bed adhesion treatment\nlayer, or for solvent-painting and filling gaps in other prints. Unfortunately, most other filaments do not have such convenient and safe solvents.\nSome people have experimented with putting piles of scrap prints on a cookie sheet in an oven and melting them into multicolor cutting boards. There's a lot you can do with this sort of heavy remelt plate if you get creative. (I personally wouldn't use cheap Asian filaments for food contact though, they often have unpleasant contaminants.)\n\n", "3d models - 3D printing with blender": "\nYou are correct about the walls. Using a Solidify object modifier is probably your best bet. A low Thickness: value (0.1 is probably good) helps keep the walls thin but strong. You can monitor the thickness while you adjust the value from Wireframe view.\n\nAdditionally, and this is probably the most important thing to know, your mesh must be clean. By clean, I mean it must all be one piece. No separate cubes, cylinders, etc. that you added while modeling, just one solid piece. Think about it this way. If you have added a cube and part of that cube is inside the rest, it might look good from the outside. But the 3D Printer isn't printing the outside, it's printing everything. So that wall, albeit hidden, that is present on the inside of your mesh will be printed.\nBad:\n\nGood:\n\nLastly, if you have parts of your mesh that can't be printed from the bottom up, or wouldn't stand by itself, consider adding supports. You can always cut these off later.\nLeg added because it wouldn't stand by itself:\n\n", "Heated bed thermistor placement": "\nDepending on thermistor type you can get values from around 1ohm/C to 0.01ohm/C\nso placing it on particulat place on heatbed (HB) could be very important. If objects are placed in the center then it's quite obwious that thermistor should be placed also in the middle.\nAnother issue in terms of thermistors are the wires. Because thermistors can be so sensitive then wires should have as less influence as possible on its temperature capacity. That's why wires and thermistor legs are so thin. Generally thiner than regular element's legs.\nAnswering your question - I would say it's better to put thermistor in the center hole, to use thermal grease in the hole so thermistor would have contact with HB. And personally I would use special thin wires to connect thermistor to the board. Kapton tape is then usefull to position thermistor head in the hole and in the thermal grease. Have a look on the picture.\n\nI have such configuration. (In fact I got additional insulation as mentioned in this thread).\nI would not recommend to use circuit board tracks as a thermistor connectors at all, but it's my opinion of course.\n[edit]\nPlease be careful - thermal grease can be electrical conductor or insulator. You should choose insulator because short circuit thermistor legs will cause measuring impossible.\n[edit2]\nAs you know HB is not even necessary when you print PLA so in this case it can be even better to not have heating at all than to overheat the bed. Because if you put your thermistor near to the edge of HB then (as said by Leo Ervin) the difference can be at level of 20C so if you heat around 70C and you get 90C your model can become soft on the bed surface and it will loose dimensions or you'll get elephant foot.\nAs stated in the comments - it's not really big deal whether you measure the temperature in the center of somewhere around. The issue is what level of perfection is ok for you. \n", "calibration - Do I need to recalibrate z-probe offset every time I switch to a different layer height?": "\nAll modern slicers adjust the nozzle position for the first layer in accordance with your chosen layer height. You can see this in your gcode if you slice files with different layer heights. Before you add special slicer settings and offsets, if you print 0.1mm layers, the nozzle will start at Z=0.1mm, and if you print 0.3mm layers, the nozzle will start at Z=0.3mm.\nThere are two reasons this is more complex and less reliable than it seems:\nDifferent slicers assume different initial tramming gaps. And your actual tramming gap may not match that assumption. If the slicer thinks your nozzle is leveled at Z=0 with a real physical gap of 0.1mm to start with, that means gcode Z=0.1mm is actually a 0.2mm gap that must be filled with plastic. So the slicer must compensate by starting lower than the nominal layer height. \nSo what works perfectly for one slicer won't necessarily work correctly for another slicer. And if you tram with a thinner object than the slicer expects (say a post-it note instead of business card) then your first layer will be off.  This is why I personally prefer physical build plate leveling mid-print using screws while watching the strands go down. It bypasses all the assumptions about tramming gaps and just gives you the correct result. (Or you can do the same thing with babystepping in firmware that supports that.)\nThe other issue is that people use lots of weird, ad hoc slicer tricks to get their first layer to stick. Things like printing the first layer much hotter, or at half speed, or squashed way down and over-extruded, or at 60% layer height, or at 200% extrusion width, will all affect the extrusion volume calibration and the space-filling behavior of the molten plastic flowing onto the bed. The slicer doesn't really have the ability to understand \"your\" first-layer adhesion recipe. \nThe combination of incorrect/unknown tramming gap and person-specific first-layer settings is why the slicer can't always get the first layer height and extrusion volume correct across all layer heights. Within some fairly reasonable assumptions, the slicer is smart enough to always correctly relate extruder flow and nozzle position so it fills the space between the nozzle and whatever surface you're printing onto. But if you break those assumptions, it may perform differently for different settings. \n", "safety - Creating positives for a food-safe silicone mold: safe?": "\nIn principle, ABS is safe for contact with (cold or room-temperature) food. The two main concerns specific to 3D printing are, assuming you start with a filament that is not itself contaminated:\n\nPores and holes in the printed part which may harbor bacteria\nImpurities introduced into the plastic during the printing process\n\nI doubt that the silicone mold will capture the pores and holes with sufficient detail to be of any concern (it certainly won't capture the internal structure, only the surface).\nThat leaves us with 2. It has been noted that brass nozzles contain trace amounts of lead. This lead can contaminate the printed part, which may in turn contaminate your mold, which may in turn contaminate your food. I don't think this is of realistic concern, since we're looking at trace amounts of trace amounts of lead. The nozzle might also have burnt plastic stuck to it (which might be carcinogenic) so you should make sure to do the print with a very clean nozzle and at a temperature that is not too high.\nABS is food safe for contact with cold or room-temperature food. It is however not food safe for contact with hot food, because at higher temperatures the food may leach certain chemicals out of the plastic. Your application is one of low temperature, but silicone is not food and might perhaps leach some contaminants out of the plastic, regardless of temperature. However, this concern is not specific to 3D printing, as it applies to the method of making moulds out of Lego bricks as well. Therefore, making moulds from 3D printed positives does not appear to be different in a food safety perspective from making them out of LEGO blocks.\n", "safety - How to transport a 3D printer? Dismount needed?": "\nYes, fix the motors and any other loose/movable parts. Remove the bowden tube if it's there, and any other parts that are sticking out.

However, you asked for the advantages and I will name some of them on which one can base a decision.\nA 3D printer enclosure\n\nhelps to keep the temperature of the whole print at controlled levels, if you use a heating element, thermocouple and pid regulator. This is one of the most direct uses of the enclosure, which can be achieved by almost no other means. One could sloppily say it does for the whole print what the heatbed does for the initial layers. Controlling the temperature can be beneficial for layer adhesion and can help against delamination problems. This can go as far as fixing cracks and complete delamination (Thanks to @J. Roibal for bringing these cracks to my attention in the comments)\nkeeps dangerous fumes controlled. Here you can find a scientific study about it, published in Atmospheric Environment 79, titled 'ultrafine particle emission from desktop 3D printers, on exactly that topic. You can embed a filter with a fan in your housing to filter the air from all dangerous fumes that are created when melting certain plastic types. It could just circulate the air inside the chamber or get the filtered air out of the housing. This is another use which cannot be achieved otherwise (afaik).\ncan keep humidity away from your printer.

In that sense, it also\nshuts out any wind for print temperature stability.

Be sure to consider the size of the model being printed and the additional area covered if you are using skirts or rafts.\nIf you apply the glue stick at the moment you turn on the printer, it will be dry enough to work properly. The printer \"uses time\" to initialize and to calibrate which provides enough drying time.

For succeeding model printing, ensure that you've filled in the areas missing glue from removing the previous model.\nYou will want to remove the glue (hot water works good, but the build plate gets hot!) when you feel that the glue build-up changes the texture of the bottom layers.\nYou may have already learned from the forums that you print on the non-grid side of the build plate.\n", "desktop printer - How often should I replace the glue layers on the bed?": "\nDepends on the glue and on your tolerance for messy undersides on your prints.

You can perhaps solve this by adjusting the endstop to trigger at the correct point, but you can also adjust this behavior in software: In your start G-code, after the homing (G28) command, insert a G92 Y15 to tell the printer that the current position (reached after homing) is actually y = 15.\nAnother option is to use the M206 command to permanently store the offset in EEPROM (rather than needing to provide it in the start code each time).\nIf your printer moves towards max rather than min, the same applies, but consider that the offset may be caused by the bed size defined in your firmware not corresponding to the bed size set in your slicer.\n", "3d design - How to 3D Print 5-pointed star object that doesn't have flat bottom and hole in the middle?": "\nTypical FDM desktop 3D printers might struggle with this model as it requires you to either print large overhangs and use support structure (when printed laying down), or lacks a natural flat bottom surface to get good print adhesion (when printed upright).

I only focused on variables you might see out of a hobbyist-style machine and if you've operated any of these you'll know that there are many more variables that pop up for any of these machines.\nSo, do not expect such a plug-n-play solution as each machine requires quality construction of its hardware, the ability to handle the variability of the process in its software, and, above all, an operator that understands the correlation and balance of these components.\nAll of that being said, there are some machines that seem to be tailored to this such as the machine by Diyouware and ZMorph (No affiliation, just examples). However, notice that they have created their own software to meet a lot of these communication requirements.\nUpdate\nI forgot to mention the fact that a kink in creating a interchangeable machine is the control interface. The controller converts the \"software speak\" into an easily parsed series of functions (typically G-Code) for the small computer to process its predetermined hardware processes. Ie, The slicer or CAM software determines that a layer of a circle be 3D printed, milled, routered, or lasered, so the controller should G02I2 which could parse to (For all intents and purposes in javascript, not a practical language) CWCircularInterpolation(2,null,null,null,null,null) and run as:\nfunction CWCircularInterpolation(i,j,k,x,y,z){\n //Some code to take current position and command to create a canned circle path\n}\n\nThe point is that the software needs to handle the conditions and constraints of a different machining process and provide a well-equipped machine with the right commands. There are a lot of different things to consider in attempting to combine these machining techniques into a single machine and get quality results.\n", "print quality - Tinkerine 3D Printer": "\nThe issue occurring here is similar to a question asked over here. It looks as though this is a result of a hardware fault related to the stepper drivers. @DarthPixel recommended placing heatsinks on the stepper driver(s) and/or properly placed fans.\n\nDepending on the design of your machine, some stepper drivers are going to be worked harder than others. For example, a MakerBot Replicator will work the X-Axis stepper driver more than the Z-Axis stepper driver. Therefore, you have a higher chance of overheating your X-Axis stepper driver.(Images are of A4988 Stepper Driver, not directly compatible with MakerBot Replicator)\nAlternatively, I personally have seen the issue repeated by manually triggering one of the limit switches.

When the filament is new it will print easier, requiring less heat to print well. So if you didn't store your filament properly to begin with, increasing print temperature will make it jam less and increase layer bonding. \nThe reason for this is because the moisture that accumulates in the filament will absorb heat and evaporate when printed, meaning that the filament itself isn't getting the same amount of heating as it used to.\nThat being said, the storage suggestions mentioned by tbm should be your first priority. I personally put my filament in Zip Lock plastic bags and store these in a dry location not exposed to sun or temperature changes.\n", "maintenance - What should I pay attention to after taking a 3d printer from extended storage": "\nAfter storage you can check the following things before taking the machine into operation again:\n\nAre all cables intact?

Depending on your design, this might not be a big issue. However, it does not take too much time and doesn't hurt. If you're using bushings, you don't want the dust shortening the lifetime of your rods/bushings if it is that easily avoidable. (side-note: the lifetime of bushings in regular 3D Printing use is more than you can print)\nApply fresh grease/oil, depending on what design your printer follows. The old grease/oil might have come off or aged.\nWipe off dust from the bed. - No dust on the nozzle, no dust embedded in your print.\nWhile they most likely will not change, there is a chance that your thermistors are off. This property should be given by the manufacturer as max. drift/year.\nCheck your belts and pulleys. The belts might have come loose - tighten them again. If they lost their elasticity (does the 'curve' it made around the pulley stay to some extent?) they might need to be replaced.\nCheck your fans when turning on the printer. You wouldn't want to lose electronics when you can cover this with a look, however unlikely it might be.\n\nHappy calibrating after that ;)\n*edit:\nAs Tom already pointe out, most of these things are unlikely, due to the usually rigid construction of the printer. These are merely more or less likely possibilities of things that can go bad or worse in storage.\n*/edit\n", "filament - Can aged PLA be refurbished?": "\nThe easiest way to freshen up filament is hot air, although there are other options.\nThere is an optimal melt processing moisture level for every plastic, typically in the range of 0.1-0.2% water content by weight. But the equilibrium moisture content of most plastics in humid air can be more like 1%. As a consequence, hot air dehydration is standard practice to prepare plastic pellets for extrusion in industry. Pretty much every injection-molded and extruded plastic product in the world -- including 3d printer filament -- is made with pre-dried pellets. Hot air is blown through the pellets until they are below the moisture limit.\nDifferent plastics tolerate extrusion with different amounts of moisture, and absorb different amounts of moisture. They can also tolerate different drying temperatures. So the ideal storage and drying conditions vary by material. \n\nPLA absorbs relatively little moisture, but in humid environments can accumulate enough water content to cause steam bubbles during extrusion. In some cases, steam bubbles can contribute to hot end jamming. Extreme wetness has been known to cause swelling that can increase filament feed drag. It's arguable whether wetness actually causes brittleness, or if that is a separate aging issue. People who keep their homes below ~50% relative humidity usually don't have any problems. Leaving PLA in a dry environment for a week or two should adequately re-dry it, or it can be gently heated to about 120F / 50C for a couple hours. (Some people dry it hotter. but that risks deforming the filament.)\nABS also doesn't absorb very much water, but perhaps a little more than PLA. It also experiences steam bubbles, but that's typically the only issue. Homes below ~45% RH usually don't have problems. Storing ABS with fresh silica gel for a couple weeks will dry it. Or it can be oven-dried up to about 180F / 80C for an couple hours. HIPS can be treated the same. \nThe kind of PET used in plastic bottles is rapidly degraded into tar by hydrolysis when melted with any significant water content. So PETG filaments are specially blended to absorb less water and to be less damaged by water than PET. But there is still the possibility of bubbles and cloudy strands due to steam expansion at higher temperatures, and there is some evidence that wet PETG produces weaker, more brittle prints than dry PETG. Different manufacturers' blends require different conditions: some people report Taulman t-glase needs oven-drying and careful storage while Esun PETG is fairly tolerant of normal home humidity levels. Oven-drying at 150F / 65C should work well. \nNylon absorbs a huge amount of water, which causes it to swell considerably, produce massive steam bubbles, look cloudy, warp more, and adhere less than properly-dried nylon. It's nearly unprintable when wet. It should be oven-dried at around 150F / 65C for 4+ hours -- desiccant will not strip enough moisture from it. In fact, nylon will pull water out of used silica gel! Once dry, it should be stored with an aggressive desiccant (either bone-dry silica or preferably calcium chloride). It only takes a few hours of exposure to air for it to become excessively moist. Building a sealed drybox feed system is highly recommended to avoid exposed time during and between prints. \nPolycarbonate is similar to nylon in that is is an aggressive water-absorber. It will look cloudy, produce steam bubbles, warp more, and provide very poor layer bonding when wet. It should be oven-dried at 180F / 80C if on a plastic spool (up to 250F / 120C if dried alone) for 4+ hours and then stored in a drybox with aggressive desiccant just like nylon. Note that some modern PC blends like Esun ePC are less prone to water absorption, at the cost of some decrease in mechanical properties. \nPVA is basically destroyed by airborne humidity, since it literally dissolves in water. Store in a drybox with an aggressive desiccant at all times. \n\nComposite filaments should be treated like the base material. \nSome drying and prevention options:\n\nOven: The \"warm\" setting will usually work pretty well. Let the oven preheat and settle out for a while, and measure temperature with a good oven thermometer or thermocouple. Shield the filament from direct radiant heating and hot spots with aluminum foil, cookie sheets, etc. Electric ovens will dry faster than gas ovens, because burning natural gas produces some additional moisture. Do not leave the oven unattended if using temperatures above the glass point of the filament, or bad things may happen!\n\"Light bucket\": A 5-gallon plastic bucket with an incandescent lightbulb inside is a pretty effective way to gently warm low-temp filament like PLA for drying or medium-term storage. Leave the lid slightly open if drying. \nFood dehydrator: Works great. Set temperatures as per the oven temps above. The main challenge is getting a large enough space inside for a filament spool. \nDesiccant: In order for desiccant to actively dry filament, it must be significantly more attractive to water than the filament is. And affinity for water is a function of how wet the material already is. That means dry desiccant can easily pull some water out of very wet filament, but wet desiccant can actually give water TO the filament! Rechargeable indicator desiccant (such as an Eva-Dry E-333 unit) is ideal. It's also important to have ENOUGH desiccant: silica gel can only absorb 10% of its weight in water at 20% RH. That means to pull 1% moisture content out of a wet 1kg spool, you would need to start with at least 100g of bone-dry, fresh-baked silica! \"Used\" silica is basically useless, it already contains too much water to pull any more from the filament. But you can re-dry the silica in an oven. 250F / 120C for 6 hours should be safe for all types of silica gel, but more aggressive drying (including microwave drying) is possible for some silica gels. Follow the gel manufacturer instructions. \nRice: Does not work. It's basically a myth that rice has drying power. A bag of rice you buy at the store is already pretty close to moisture equilibrium with the air, so it has minimal capacity to pull water from filament (or a soaked iPhone, for that matter). If you dry the rice in an oven to drive out its water first, it will work to some degree, but silica gel is considerably more effective. \nKitty litter: Silica gel style kitty litter is nearly identical to desiccant silica gel. Like rice, it is fairly close to saturated when you open the container, but can be dried in the oven to be a good cheap bulk desiccant. Clay type kitty litter is not as effective. Be careful of getting kitty litter dust all over your filament. \nDry storage A thick plastic box with an airtight seal is preferable. Look for recycling code 2 (HDPE) or 5 (PP) on the box. 5 gallon buckets with sealing lids also work fine. Ziplocks and other thin plastic bags are better than nothing, but are permeable to water (yes, really) and can only be relied on as long as there is fresh desiccant in the bag. Acrylic/plexiglas dryboxes have been sold by various people, but acrylic is very permeable to water, so I don't recommend that option. \nAir conditioning: Simply keeping the air in your printing environment reasonably dry will protect PLA and ABS and other low-absorption filaments. It may help to buy a humidity monitor to get an understanding of your ambient humidity. \n\nNow, considering the original question here, it's important to note that moisture content is not the only way filament can age or be damaged. PLA in particular is prone to becoming brittle over time. There are different theories for why this occurs. One is gradual chemical aging because poly(lactic acid) simply is not a very stable polymer. Moisture could contribute to that aging process, but true chemical aging would be irreversible even if the filament is later dried. How much this occurs should depend on the specific polymer blend and storage conditions. \nAnother theory for PLA aging is that the residual filament extrusion stresses (from being drawn down to the correct diameter and rapidly quenched in a water bath) are slowly creeping over time. Anyone who has placed a PLA part under heavy load for more than a few weeks will see PLA creep. It's a rather odd polymer in that it will \"creep to failure\" and crack at very low creep elongations rather than progressively deform in a ductile manner like most creep-prone materials. So if the PLA has significant stresses locked-in from the initial extrusion process (which is very common) it may be creeping into a more brittle arrangement of polymer molecules over time. That would explain the aging effect, and it would explain why \"drying\" sometimes rejuvenates the PLA: heating the filament near its glass point will allow the polymer molecules to gently relax and basically anneal to a less brittle state. \n", "How does the sizes of nozzle diameter and the Z-axis layer resolution work?": "\nYes, they do reduce the speed. Basically, the speed at which you feed filament determines how large of a volume comes out, and the distance you move the extruder means this volume gets distributed over this distance. However, this is not the whole story.\nThe size of your nozzle determines only two things: the maximum layer height and the minimum feature size. It does not affect minimum layer height (and obviously doesn't affect maximum feature size) although there are some practical constraints (you wouldn't want to print 0.1\u00a0mm layers with a 5\u00a0mm nozzle).\nThe nozzle squishes the filament down as it is extruded; the filament is basically forced into the gap between the nozzle and the previous layer. There's no limit to how thin of a layer you can print (the 60 micron figure is just something the marketing department made up, you can likely print even thinner layers). So long as you can position your Z-axis with sufficient accuracy (which is usually no problem) you can print arbitrarily thin layers.\nOn the other hand, the nozzle size does determine the maximum layer height. Your need the filament to be squished a bit, or else it won't stick to the previous layer properly. You can't print layers thicker than your nozzle size, and it is generally recommended to print with a layer size that is at most 80\u00a0% of your nozzle size (e.g. with a 0.4\u00a0mm nozzle you shouldn't attempt to print layers thicker than 0.32\u00a0mm) but this is just a guideline.\nYour extrusion width is the width of the line deposited by your nozzle. This is generally (due to the mentioned squishing) a bit larger than your nozzle size. With a 0.4\u00a0mm nozzle you should set your extrusion width to something slightly larger, like 0.5\u00a0mm. It is technically possible to print with an extrusion width that is the same as (or even smaller) than your nozzle size, but this results in very weak prints: as mentioned before, you want the plastic to get squished slightly.\nThey claim an accuracy up to 100 micron. This doesn't mean that you can print features as small as 100 micron (since you can't, due to the extrusion width being much larger). What this means, is for example, that if you print a 10\u00a0mm cube, you should expect its real size to be between 9.9\u00a0mm and 10.1\u00a0mm. Such a cube does not have any features that are smaller than your minimum feature size, but its outer walls can be positioned with greater precision than this minimum feature size.\nI should caution you that the 100 micron figure is \"up to\" and in practice you will have a hard time achieving this.\n", "ventilation - ABS Filament safety concerns": "\nYes... The issue with all 3d printing materials. Not just ABS, but worse with ABS is the fine air particulate and Ultra fine it creates during the 3d printing process. PLA is considered safer than ABS. But I fear people will use this as justification, it is like saying I only smoke one cig a day instead of two so I am safe and healthy. No it really should be taken seriously.\nThere are a number of scientific papers and articles proving that this is an issue. Specifically that 3d printers release ultra fine particles into the air.

FPEs are thought to irritate the lungs. \nThese graphs are of the ultra fine particle emissions.\n\n\nas you can see PLA is MUCH safer in this regard.\nI cannot find the paper at the moment, but the recommendation is a full air cycle several times an hour.

One thing to be aware of, though, is that some of these filaments wear down the nozzle far more quickly than ordinary PLA, and therefore should be used with reinforced nozzles (unless you have extra nozzles to spare). Carbon fibre and metallic filaments are generally known to increase nozzle wear, while softer alloys such as wood and bamboo generally are less abrasive.\nA quick google search reveals that many people have used non-proprietary filament on the M3D Micro successfully, but be aware that using such filaments is not covered by your warranty.

Extruder advance is a feature that tries to compensate for the delay between feeding (or retracting) the filament and the point at which it actually starts to extrude, but it's generally not used. The fact that the manufacturer left D_FILAMENT at the default of 2.85 probably means they didn't enable this. You can check whether it is enabled by seeing if there is an (uncommented) #define ADVANCE.\nThe reason D_FILAMENT appears twice is because they're computing the cross-sectional area of your filament, which proportional to the square of its diameter.\nThe arc interpolation settings have nothing to do with extruder calibration at all, but define the resolution at which G2/G3 approximate arcs.

As such, a 1kg spool of ABS would be 400 meters (1.75mm filament) or 156 meters (2.85mm filament).

They find that thicker layers result in a stronger part, with 0.3mm layers giving a part that is around 24% stronger than the same part printed with 0.1mm layers.\nOne small issue with this study is that it did not look at the effects of temperature. Raising the temperature generally results in stronger parts because the layers will fuse better. It is possible that you could make a 0.1mm part just as strong as a 0.3mm part by raising the printing temperature.\nAnother consideration for inter-layer bonding is how much the next layer is \"squished\" onto the previous one. Using a wider extrusion width will improve strength.\nThe main issue with the strength of FDM parts is that they tend to break much easier along the layers, much like how wood is much stronger across the grain. You have to take this into account when making your design, and ensure that features that will be subjected to stress/strain are printed in the XY-plane.\n", "material - How to reuse modelling bases for the Stratasys uPrint SE Plus?": "\nWhat I tried and worked is to apply water based normal Glue-stick on the tray and with few drops of water distribute it evenly across the tray surface, let it dry and then you are good to go!\n", "repetier - Trying to flash Davinci XYZ 1.0, nothing but black bars": "\nI had this occur on my MakerBot Replicator Dual after I tried repairing a blown voltage regulator. If you refer to the previous link to my SE question, pay attention to the comments of Ryan's answer where it is explained that (in my case at least) the main processor was damaged and therefore couldn't properly load the firmware. The machine was able to load just enough to initialize the chip on the LCD screen, but since the main boards processor was blown, couldn't load the firmware to send commands to the screen and continue the boot sequence.\nI'm not certain that you're encountering the same EXACT issue, but you have all of the same side effects that I did.

You'll probably want to heed some of the following points:\n\nNo colors in the background/stand, keep to shades (unless otherwise specified for scanner)\nNo gradients. This applies to poor lighting causing a \"gradient\" light effect\nSet the backdrop beyond the range of the scanner if possible (like with Skanect w/ Microsoft Kinect)\nIdeally set the backdrop and especially the stand in contrast with the color of the object.\n\nYou're right, a typical 3D scanner will have a difficult time with darker colors due to physics. However, there are no rules that say you can't change the color of the object.\nIn this application, I would suggest just going ahead and spray painting the object and scanning it. Scanning the insole is going to require super tight tolerances in scanning as I'm assuming the insole is naturally worn due to use. \nCompletely alternatively from 3D scanning, you could try using a 3D touch probe like on a CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine). It will take longer, but a touch probe doesn't care what color the object is.\nUpdate\nThe touch probe comment seems to be a hit, so I'll elaborate. My experience with touch probes comes only from manufacturing technology and can be found and in a variety of different machine tools:\n\nMills\nLathes\nCMMs\nVision Systems\n\"Romer\" Arms (aka portable CMM)\n\nYou could probably get away with searching for a local machine shop (or job shop) and asking if they have a machine for reverse engineering. The quickest and easiest machine for reverse engineering (in my experience) is a portable CMM, I recommend Googling it.\nAlternatively, I've heard of people adding touch probes to their 3D Printers, but I haven't seen it before. In theory, a basic touch probe can easily be achieved by using a momentary switch. If you're good with programming and maybe a bit of Arduino, you could do the following:\n\nAdd momentary (normally off) switch to Arduino \nFind a way of attaching the switch (below nozzles)\nConnect to your 3d printer in your preferred method and preferred programming language. I've used the provided libraries in Python that come with installing MakerWare in order to connect to my MakerBot.\nWrite your routine to sequentially move the new probe in a grid pattern and then incrementally move the Z up until you get a signal from your Arduino that the momentary has been switched on.\nFor each trigger, append a simple text file with a new line containing the coordinates.\nonce complete, you should have a \"point cloud\" of your insole which, if formatted correctly, will be able to import into CAD software\n\nThere are a few file types off the top of my head that can be used including:\n\n.pts\n.XYZ\n.CSV\n\n", "prusa i3 rework - Connecting Sain Smart Mechanical End Stops to Ramps 1.4?": "\nThe multiple connections are redundant.

The two middle pins are both ground, but you only need to use one of them.\nYou can simply connect signal to signal and ground to ground. That is sufficient for the endstop to work. You only need to connect VVC to VVC if you want the LED that's on the board to function.\n", "How do I tell if my Thermistors are 10k or 100k?": "\nAs @DwayneReid already said: take a multimeter and measure the resistivity. It will either be in the ballpark of 10KOhms or 100KOhms. If you already got a readout close to room temperature you're resistivity put in the firmware should be fine.\nHowever, now it is still important to find out which make of thermistor you have, since they all behave slightly different. Find out about that in the manual of you 3D printer / hotend or in the documentation of wherever you got the thermistor from. Select the corresponding entry in Marlin then.\n", "prusa i3 rework - How do you make sure you have the right voltage on the trimpots on an A4988 stepper driver?": "\nGenerally speaking voltage on stepstick output should be around 1V. \nTo imagine more or less what the current and what the voltage is, you can think about it in the same way as about water.\nThe wire is more or less the same as the pipe.\nThe voltage can be imagined as (sort of) the height from which the water flows but the current can be imagined as an amount of water which flows. To simplify things we assume that all our pipes are closed into circuit and we have pump/battery and we have a motor which is a reverted pump ;) and finally we have our stepstick which is a tap in our model.\nSo no matter what the height (voltage) is we know that tap (stepstick) will pass some amount (current) of water. We can drive it turning tap or turning a potentiometer on the stepstick PCB.\nSo we got it. Principles (deadly simplified) are now clear. See here for more details\nGetting back to your question. \nYou have to know what is your stepstick reference voltage. To make sure about that you have to check out resistor(s) next to main black element on stepstick board. There should be R100 or R200 which are very common.\nNow you should read data from motor label to know what is proper current for your motor and calculate\nvoltage = motor_current * 8 * resistance_of_resistor\nSo now you know what is proper voltage for your motor and stepstick.\nYou measure voltage between potentiometer and GND (see on the picture)\n\nIf you set and connect everything and start printouts you should check motor temperature. Use your finger. If you can touch motor and hold your finger not more than half a second then probably the voltage set on potentiometer is too high (motor can reach 80\u00b0 Celsius and it's fine but more will shorten its life span) and you should reduce it a bit (reduce by 5/100 V). If you notice that motor growls or barks then your voltage is probably too low and you can increase it by 5/100V.\nToo high current will also reduce longevity of stepstick so cool them out with fan.\nPlease be noticed.\nZ-axis motors will usually be not too hot as they work less than X and Y but as they are both connected to one stepstick so they need more current - set higher voltage there.\nHere is a reprap.org site to get basic knowledge about stepsticks.\n", "Distortion calibration on XY plane in Repetier": "\nSkew distortion in deltas means there is something physically wrong with your printer build, such as the towers not being evenly spaced or being tilted.

That's all. Correct me if I'm wrong but it sounds like very common situation where some parts are hanging like your yellow disks.\nOtherwise if your model is going to be closed at the bottom and at the top you can mock support on your own to have better control of it. How? Just add hollow cylinders under your disk so in fact cylinder will stay on the bottom layer then its walls will be support and finally your yellow disk will be a top cover of the cylinder. I hopw you can imagine that properly.\nAnother way is to design support elements wich would grow out of walls and this way support your disks\n\nMaybe if you would explain a bit more, what the model is then I could support you more.\n[edit]\nTo make it more automatic, you could try to use parametric CAD apps. I would say, Autodesk Inventor is one which I can suggest. You can use for example its Ribs functionality as support (varsion C).\n[edit2]\nAfter Tormod Haugene's and tbm0115's comments I decided to fill some gaps in my answer. Here go pros and cons of options A, B and C.\n\noption A\n\nThe simplest one and more or less automatic one. Which means when user add support then this option will be a result of it. Of course if user needs to have support only for the disk but over the disk there will be... a \"ceiling\" then option A cannot use regular support as it will generate a support also for the ceiling. For such situation user needs to add a cylinder manually (filled one) or\n\noption B\n\nUser can add hollow cyliner (just its walls). This option can give similar or higher stiffness as regular support because solid walls increase endurance tahn thin support grid.\n\noption C\n\nThis option (my personal choose) has some advantages unavailable in A or B option. First - support doesn't have to have \"ground\" base. It means the yellow disk can really hang even if there is no bottom layer at all. Second - it joins walls with disk and walls together so the stiffness concerns other surfaces.\nDepending on needs the cylinder (option A or B) can be transformed into a cross or pillar (thinner than cylinder itself). It can be more taper expandint to the top or to the bottom.\nThere could be even option where the above one would be joined with option C. So these (3) ribs would raise from the bottom but not from the walls.\n", "heat management - How to utilize/calibrate print fans for PLA?": "\nEverybody's combination of fan hardware and print settings is different. Unless someone else has the exact same printer and slicer profiles as you, there's no way to really say anything like \"use X% for PLA\" or whatever. For practical purposes, you just empirically figure it out with test prints based on a few simple rules of thumb:\n\nUse lots of cooling for PLA, moderate cooling for PETG, and minimal cooling for ABS. (Note that sometimes ABS does benefit from gentle airflow, and PLA shouldn't necessarily always just be blasted at max power.)\nUse less cooling on big prints where each layer takes a long time, more cooling on small prints where each layer is very quick.\nAxial / box fan? You'll probably want to run it at full power. Radial / squirrel cage blower? You may want to run lower power. \nOverhangs curling up or sagging? More airflow may be needed. (Lower layer heights also help enormously.)\nHot end temp sagging when the fan kicks on? Try less airflow. (Or insulate your hot block better.)\nWeak layer bonding? Try less airflow. (Or raise your hot end temp.)\nSmall, fast prints getting mushy or corners \"pulling in\"? You need more airflow. (Or lower heatbed temps.)\nPrint warping / corners lifting off the bed? Try less airflow, particularly on the lowest few layers. (Or higher heatbed temps, or a better adhesion layer, or less nozzle/bed gap for the first layer, or any other approach.)\nFan too noisy? Try less airflow. (Or get a better fan.)\nFilament stringing during travel moves? Try less airflow pointed directly at the nozzle. (Or tune your retraction settings better, or get the moisture out of your filament, or lower hot end temp.)\n\n", "electronics - What is the influence of a lower BAUDrate?": "\nBaud rate is the rate at which information is transferred in a communication channel, given as a number of bits per second (bps). So a baud rate of 250000 is capable of transferring a maximum of 250000 bits per second (31250 bytes/s). When working with serial ports, both ends of the communication line will have to \"talk\" with the same speed - the same baud rate - to understand each other.\nSo when using a baud rate of 11520 you will theoretically be limited to transfer data with about half the speed of 25000. If you are transferring large amounts of data, this might be a limiting factor for your application, but if you are not pushing the limits of your serial port, it probably won't matter at all.\n", "pla - Irregular 3D printed part": "\nYour print isn't cooling fast enough. With small, thin prints like this, PLA needs a fair bit of airflow to solidify before the next layer goes down. Your printer doesn't appear to have a proper print-cooling fan, so I have two suggestions:\n\nPrint two or even three of the part at the same time, spaced a fair distance apart on the build plate. This will give each of them time to cool.\nPoint a box fan into the front of the printer to get good airflow over the print.\n\n", "stepper - How to keep Z-axis motor from slipping when powered down": "\nThe simple way to do this is to use a self-locking screw pitch. Pretty much any single-start thread using a sliding nut cannot be back-driven so the load will not fall. Normal 8x8 trapezoidal thread screws will easily back-drive because of the steep pitch. \nLikewise, a worm drive between the motor and Z stage will hold the load. You would want to switch from screws to belts for the main motion stage in that case though, to avoid having too much total gear reduction. \nBoth of these solutions will limit your maximum Z speed, of course. But they're simple and reliable. Clutches and brakes add a lot of complexity and must be actuated somehow. Designers who want the load to stay suspended almost always simply use single-start screws. \n", "What are the parts that make up a hotend, and what do they do?": "\nThis varies by hotend design. The following is a list of components which you might find in a typical hotend, but note that different designs may integrate these components to some extent. For instance, on the J-head the heat block, nozzle and heatbreak are all one and the same component whereas on the E3D hotends these are all separate parts.\n\nNozzle: This is the part where the filament comes out. It takes in the molten filament (typically as a bead of 1.75mm/3mm) and tapers down to the nozzle size (typically around 0.4mm). These are typically made of brass for its good heat conductivity, but brass is not suitable for printing abrasive materials (such as glow in the dark and metal-filled filaments) so sometimes (hardened) stainless steel is used.\nHeater Block: Usually made from aluminium, the heater block joins the nozzle to the heat break and holds the heater cartridge and thermistor.\nHeater Cartridge: most hotends use a ceramic heater cartridge, though some older designs use power resistors or nichrome wire. This component is, as the name suggests, responsible for heating up the hotend. The heat block usually clamps around the heater cartridge to provide good contact.\nThermistor: This part senses the temperature of the heat block. It is usually a small glass bead with two wires attached (which are typically insulated with glass fiber or teflon). For high-temperature printing, a thermocouple may be used in stead.\nHeat Break: this is the part where hot meets cold. It usually takes the form of a thin tube and is made of stainless steel for its low thermal conductivity. The goal is generally to have the transition be as short as possible so as little of the filament is in a molten state as possible. It connects the heat block to the heat sink.\nHeat Sink: the purpose of the heat sink is to cool down the cold side of the heat break. It is typically cooled with a fan. Most heat sinks also have a standard groove-mount for mounting to your printer. The heat sink usually has grooves to increase its surface area and cooling capability.\nTeflon Liner: some hotends have a PTFE liner that guides the filament through the heat break into the nozzle. This makes it easier to print PLA, but compared to an all-metal hotend, limits the temperatures at which you can print (making it difficult to print PETG and impossible to print polycarbonate).\n\nThe ubis hotend you mentioned is a bit simpler than this, and simply uses a big chunk of PEEK in place of the heat break/sink. PEEK has very low thermal conductivity and thus passive cooling is sufficient. However, PEEK limits the temperatures at which you can print.\nHere is an illustration outlining these components on an E3D V6 hotend:\n\nNote that in this image the Teflon liner only goes into the heat sink, and not into the heat break or block. This means the maximum temperature is not limited by the Teflon, but if it did go all the way in (as is the case with, for instance, the Lite6) then it would be.\n", "prusa i3 - Adjusting Bed Temp values on Monoprice/Wanhao I3 (Repetier Firmware)": "\nIt is completely normal for the surface of the bed to be cooler than the indicated temperature. The thermistor goes on the underside of the bed, near the heating traces. The top of the bed (which is further away from the heating traces) will naturally be cooler.\nIt would be possible, though a lot of work, to build a custom thermistor table that more accurately reflects the surface of the bed, though that means your thermistor table will no longer reflect the characteristics of your thermistor, but instead reflect the particular circumstances under which you build your custom table (which would be affected by ambient temperature, any drafts, ...).\nThe accuracy of an infrared laser thermometer depends on the characteristics of the surface you're measuring for, so unless you adjusted the thermometer specifically to measure the aluminium surface of the bed, it's possible your thermometer is off as well.\nThe exact temperature of your bed doesn't matter anyways (you just need it approximately in the right ballpark) so I would suggest to just live with it. The 60C/90C figures are not supposed to be for the surface of the bed. They're meant to reflect the temperature reported by the printer. That said, 90C is a bit low for printing ABS (but the bed/power supply on your printer might not be powerful enough to get any higher).\n", "cooling - Sanguinololu 1.3a fan connection": "\nIt appears that there isn't an \"out-of-the-box\" solution to your request, but luck is with you.

A small turn an the set screw lets go, the nut sliding down the slot with it.

In order to use a mains voltage heatbed in a 3d printer, you will need to wire up your controller to switch an AC SSR. That way, your low-voltage-DC RAMPS board can control AC current. \nIf you plug a heatbed directly into a power supply, it will never stop heating, and may burn itself up or even cause a fire. Don't do that. \nBecause mains voltage has enough voltage to kill you, it should only be used for STATIONARY components, such as the PSU supply wiring and Delta heatbeds. With moving beds, particularly Mendel/i3 style Y-beds, wire fatigue and rubbing can expose the electrical conductors and create a serious safety hazard. \n200x200mm is a very reasonable size for a DC bed heater, so there's really no good reason to use an AC heater here. It's more complex and less safe. I recommend getting a different heater. \n", "filament - Needing a simple fix for loading TPU": "\nLoading TPU/TPE can be particularly challenging because many printer loading scripts run too fast for the soft flexible filament to effectively purge whatever normal filament you were using before. A couple tips:\n\nLoad with a slightly higher temp than either the TPU or previous filament require, so as to minimize the melt viscosity and reduce the force required.\nMake a custom gcode file that contains a slower loading routine: wait for heat, then advance the extruder at a very slow rate for a long distance. Then you just \"print\" this gcode file whenever you need to load TPU.\n\nHowever, simply being able to load is not necessarily enough. Not all extruders can reliably print flexible filaments, period. The larger the gap between the pinch wheel and inlet to the hot end, the more likely the filament is to buckle and come out the side. You need to make sure this gap is as short as possible. If there is more than a couple mm of gap, you'll need to make gap-filler or print yourself a new extruder designed for flexibles.\nPrinting slow and without major velocity changes can help, too. Use relatively low layer heights and low, constant feedrates so the extruder doesn't have to run fast or change pressure often. \nHarder flexible filaments will be easier to print if your setup is borderline. Ninjaflex is one of the hardest to print because it is relatively soft. Semi-flex type filaments are much easier to print if your hardware isn't set up optimally.\n", "3d models - Printing an iPhone Case": "\nYes this is possible. For an FDM/FFF printer, you'll need to print with supports. I might also recommend printing in PLA to minimize the chance of warping during the print (from experience).\nIt might also help to slow down the feedrate to ensure smooth surface finish and avoiding delamination on such small layers.\nYou'll probably see a decrease in the surface quality on the inside due to the printing of support scaffolding depending on the slicing engine you use.\nHowever\nYou'll want to pay attention to the strength of the case. If you print the case upright then it will be more susceptible to breaking without post-processing.\nConclusion\nUltimately, if you can get away with it, it would be better to subtract the star instead of extruding it in the model. Then you can simply print the case back face down on the plate with much better results.\n", "3d models - Using Kinect 360 as 3D Scanner": "\nI tried the same setting old kinect (but for PC - actually with power supply and usb-cable) plug to my surface windows10.\nAfter some troubles, it works now ;-)\nThe mentioned MS 3D scan and kinect readiness wont work.

I've done a fair amount of NF/ABS dualstrusion. Frankly, any TPU will probably work, since molten polyurethane sticks to practically anything. \nThe main challenge is ooze control since TPUs tend to ooze a lot. You're going to want to use a printing temp on the low end of the range for the flexible filament, and use some sort of wiper wall structure. \nAnother issue you might run into is re-priming the flexible filament after an extended idle time. It helps to use a large purge structure to ensure the nozzle gets re-primed fully. Don't use an excessively large toolchange retraction distance -- this will make it more likely that the flexible filament jams during reprime. \nThe best way to accomplish the above will depend on your slicer.

Also 250000 is the baud rate of the connection; 250000 is the default value of my printer so you need to replace this with the baud rate that your printer uses.\nimport serial\nimport time\n\nser_printer = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 250000)\nprint \"Connecting to printer...\"\ntime.sleep(30)  # Allow time for response\nbuffer_bytes = ser_printer.inWaiting()\nresponse = ser_printer.read(buffer_bytes)  # Read data in the buffer\nprint \"Connection response from printer:\"\nprint response\nprint \"Asking for temperatures (M105)...\"\nser_printer.write('M105\\n')\ntime.sleep(0.1)  # Allow time for response\nprint \"Temperature response from printer:\"\nresponse = ser_printer.readline()\nprint response\n\n", "efficiency - Are 3D printers efficient for printing a detailed iris to bypass iris identification system?": "\nI take lectures in university and was asked to read a review paper on 3D printed organs by Anthony Atala (the most famous paper in printed organs research). The paper discussed about using several techniques to print the tissue we need at functional resolution. The review also cites detailed procedures to 3D print lung and skin tissues.\nComing back to your question, we have reached a point in time where we can scan a real Iris and print them! Yes. And people use this technique called self assembly to achieve this (Other design approaches like Biomimicry and MiniTissue assembly is also being used right now). To do this we first extract cells from the donor. Or We do a functional high res scan of the extracted cell/part that we want to replicate. This is done via FMT-CT-Fluorescence Imaging, etc. And we cultivate the cells in bio incubators (we can also print cells btw - If the exact environment and operational conditions are maintained, we can print cell-replicas that will later self assemble to form the Iris with the same resolution and functional properties as that of the real one). The cultivated/printed cell is used as the tissue forming material. Forming is done by the cells themselves and is thus christened Self assembly.\nAlthough this may sound futuristic, Autonomous Self Assembly is something that's already being done in Labs! The method works by studying embryonic organ development. For instance, Early stage cellular components of a developing tissue makes their own ECM. Like mentioned before, if we use proper signalling, and environmental manipulation,  we can create autonomous organization and patterning to make something we want. Advantage of this method is that we can work without scaffolds. This method relies on cell as primary driver of histogenesis. Knowledge of how an embryo grows into tissue (embroyo tissue genesis and organogenesis) is applied to achieve \"real\" cell dimensions/properties.\nI would recommend you to read the paper for detailed information. The method I mentioned in this post is only one among three other methods that are being used currently in this domain.\nSo yeah. My answer is yes.

Be certain to desolder the right one. If unsure keep the capacitor and solder it back in if it was the wrong one.\n", "heated bed - How do I wire an AC SSR with RAMPs 1.4?": "\nIf you take a kettle lead with a wall plug and cut off the other end, it will expose 3 wires: earth, live and neutral. These are color coded depending on your country, usually earth is green (possibly with yellow stripes), neutral is blue, black, grey or white and live is brown, red or black.\nThe SSR should have 4 terminals: 2 terminals for the switched load (which are interchangeable) and 2 terminals that connect to your electronics, which should be marked negative and positive. These terminals should connect to the negative/positive heated bed output of your electronics. The terminals of the SSR should be clearly marked, and you can verify which terminal is what from the SSR's datasheet.\nTypically, your heated bed will have two wires for power (which are interchangeable). One of the wires should be connected to neutral. The other wire should go to one of the load terminals of the SSR, while the other load terminal of the SSR should connect to the live wire. It is also acceptable to do it the other way around (neutral to the SSR and live directly to the bed) but this is slightly less neat.\nFinally, and this step is extremely important, the earth wire of the plug has a protective function: should something fail, metal parts of your printer may become electrified, and shock you when you touch them. To prevent it, you should electrically connect exposed metal parts of your printer (such as the frame, heated bed plate, power supply case, etc...) to earth. This provides a path for the current to flow (and trip the protective RCD breaker) should something go wrong.\nI would further recommend that you protect your heated bed (particularly if it is a high power model) with a bimetallic thermal switch. These are available in a variety of ratings, and will switch the power to your heated bed off when it goes over a certain temperature. This switch should be wired between the relay and the heated bed, and be mounted on the heated bed so it makes good thermal contact. If you plan to print with the heated bed at 110C, you might get a 120C or 130C thermal switch.\nAs mains voltage can be deadly, you should take appropriate precautions: never work on the printer while it is plugged in, cover any connections (in particular, make sure you buy or print a cover for the SSR's terminals and wrap solder joints in heat shrink or electrical tape) and always treat wires coming out of the SSR as live (even if it is switched off, some current can still flow).\n", "How does the home position work on a Prusa i3 RepRap Printer?": "\nIt works like you describe, but it does not move all axes at the same time.

Rather, it seems like you are suffering from another issue that is not directly related to layer height.\nIt is possible that your hotend's heat sink is not being cooled enough, causing heat to migrate up and soften plastic in the heat sink, ultimately jamming it. Depending on your hotend's make, the heat sink should be cooled by a fan that is always on.\nNormally, the plastic being fed into the hotend provides some cooling, but printing at a thinner layer height decreases this effect because less plastic is fed into the hotend per time unit.\n", "print quality - Clean or wipe move for delta 3D printers": "\nYou can achieve this using the G1 command.

I've set Z to 0.2mm to avoid hitting the plate, but you might be able to lower this.\nThe next 3 lines zero the extruder position, extrudes 1mm of filament, and resets it to zero (when starting a print the slicer expects E to start at 0).\nThe final line moves back to the bed center. This might not be neccesary (you might be able to replace this line with just G1 F9000 to set the feedrate back to something that makes sense for travel moves) because you don't need to move back explicitly: the slicer will take care of moving the head in position to start the print.\n", "filament - Possible ways to print soft skin for human robot?": "\nOh that is a tricky tricky question!\nFirst you will probably need a good scan of the robot.

But it should be stopped before the nozzle.\nAs it doesn't stop the end stop doesn't work. So either the end stop is not connected to the right connector or it is triggering too late.\nThe Z end stop must be screwed at the right hight. If you mount it too far up it will not trigger. The bed assembly has a small wooden peace that sticks up. The idea is that that wooden peace pushes the end stop at the right hight.\nSo instead of configuring the hight in the firmware you need to mount the Z end stop at the exact right hight. You can make the fine adjustments(Bed Leveling) with the screws that hold the bed.\nYou can test the end stop by manually triggering while the bed moves up. It needs to stop immediately once you trigger the end stop.

App tries to orient object so all overhanging parts can be supported directly from the heatbed (not from the object itself)\n\nBut have a look on Meshmixer as Ryan Carlyle suggested. In this app you can see 3 kinds of auto orientation procedures. Additionally Meshmixer can create angle support and tree-like support.\nIn terms of mathematics. \nI cannot suggest any sources but you can imagine the way it calculates such optimal rotation. Let's say it will be dead simple explanation of the second approach:\nLet's get all faces (facets) and let's project their center points on the \"floor\" (heatbed) or \"ceiling\". If imagined projection line slices any other faces then rotation is not optimal. App can calculate \"a weight\" of such orientation and then try to find the smallest weight of all possible orientations.\nOf course it's not that simple. App has to manage concavity, which face requires support at all, and many other aspects but in general you can imagine the algorithm.\nedit\n\n\"as little support as possible\" could be considered as easier to imagine \"as little shaddow as possible\" and the problem can be simplified to projection and ray tracing\nsimilarly \"bed only support\" could be simplified to \"cast shaddows but not on itself\"\n\n", "3d design - Bridging islands in my stencil": "\nYou should know that there will be no such functionality anywhere because \"make a bridge between islands\" causes some questions:\n\nwhat do you mean be bridge\nwhere this bridge should be\nhow it should look like\n\nApplication cannot answer these questions automatically. \nConver image to 3D object is (almost) only to create logo-like-objects or text-like-objects.\nIf your image will consist more than one separate elements then MC will convert it into separate objects and these objects will be treated as separate islands. There will be no way to bridge them on certain level/layer. The only thing you can achieve is a solid \"connection\" between islands if they will be connected with line on the image. I'm sure it's not what you expect.\nAlmost all 3D apps have a functionality to create 3D obj out of image but it will always be a perimeter or surface which you can extrude.\nYou can create bridges in your app by creating additional 3D object according to your expectations or you can use sculpting app to extend a form. It means you won't add extra object but sculpt existing objects by  extruding/extending/pulling faces.\nFor such sculpting you can use Meshmixer for example.\n", "Heated bed - what are the benefits? Why use one?": "\nHeatbeds have two purposes:\n\nIncrease surface energy of the print bed to improve bonding strength of the first layer (particularly important when using surfaces like PEI or Kapton)\nKeep the bottom few millimeters of the print hot enough to provide a warp-free foundation for the rest of the print. \n\nThe bit about surface energy is straightforward. Most materials are stickier when hot than cold. In comparison, pure mechanical-bonding bed surfaces like fibrous painter's tape and perfboard don't particularly benefit from bed heat.\nWarping is a bit more complicated. The basic cause of warping is when the previous layer is allowed to cool and thermally contract before the next layer is deposited. When you stick hot, expanded material on top of cold, contracted material, large shear stresses are generated when the fresh material cools and contracts. Those inter-layer shear stresses then accumulate over many layers into large-scale bending stresses that try to lift the edges of the print off the bed.\nSo, to prevent warping, we should minimize the amount that the previous layer is allowed to cool before the next layer goes down. But we DO need it to cool solid so the print doesn't sag in a mushy mess. This is a balancing act: cooling the plastic solid without over-cooling it. The optimal temperature for the print is right around the glass point of the plastic: this is the temperature at which the plastic becomes fully solid and thermal contraction stresses start to accumulate. \nThe extruder pumps more heat into the print as it deposits molten plastic and radiates a little bit of heat. So we want to set the heatbed temp a little bit below the glass point to ensure the print is able to cool solid. Now, this gets a bit difficult, because everyone's print bed temperature sensor is different. What matters is bed surface temp. Many people have to set their bed temp quite a bit higher than the actual surface temp. It's just something you have to calibrate via print results. The exact filament glass point (Tg) also depends on the blend. \n\nABS: Tg is around 105C, optimal bed temp 95C in a warm, low-airflow environment\nPLA: Tg is around 55C, optimal bed temp is 55C in a cool, high-airflow environment because PLA holds heat and is slow to cool compared to other filaments\nPETG: Tg is around 70C, optimal bed temp is 60-70C with mild airflow\nNylon doesn't really work with these rules because it's semi-crystalline, meaning it \"freezes\" far above its Tg and thus starts accumulating warping stress at fairly high temps... advice varies wildly, from printing cold to 120C bed\nPC: Tg is around 150C, optimal bed temp is 130C\n\nThere are other schools of thought, for example printing the first layer onto a surface much hotter than Tg for good adhesion, and then dropping the bed temp to a value somewhat below Tg to allow the print to solidify. That works fine too. \nBut, with all that said, it's important to understand that the heatbed only keeps the bottom of the print warm. A centimeter up from the build plate, the print is typically much closer to ambient temp than it is to the bed temp. Heated build chambers are thus much more effective for large prints. But heatbeds are still quite effective, because they allow building a strong, warp-free foundation that resists warping stresses induced by the cooler zones higher up in the print. \n", "extruder - German RepRap NEO only heats to 130\u00b0C": "\nA few possiblitites.\nYou wire is too small.

When the port is closed, this line is HIGH (indicating the computer is not ready), and when you open the serial connection the line goes LOW (indicating the computer is ready now) and the transition from HIGH to LOW triggers a reset.\nThere are a number of ways to prevent this:\n\nIn software: disable hang up on close (HUPCL). This prevents the RTS line from going HIGH after you close it, allowing it to be subsequently opened without causing a reset. However, this does not work for the first attempt (the first, initial connection still causes a reset). How this is configured depends on your software/driver set up, but it is widely supported.\nIn software: disable the RTS line from going LOW in the first place. I'm not sure if this is readily possible with common serial drivers.\nIn software: modify your workflow to always keep the connection open, preventing the associated reset from happening.\nIn hardware: your printer's board will have some circuitry on there that translates the RTS line transitioning from HIGH to LOW to trigger a reset, usually this is implemented in the form of a single capacitor between RTS and RST. RST is normally pulled high with a pull-up resistor (on the order of 10k or so), and when RTS transitions to low the capacitor briefly allows some current to flow, pulling RST low. One way to prevent this is to include a stronger pull-up resistor that overcomes the current drain associated with the RTS line going LOW. DisablingAutoResetOnSerialConnection suggests using a 330 Ohm resistor between VCC and GND.\nIn hardware: desolder the capacitor mentioned earlier.\n\n", "3d design - What is the best 3D modeling software for a beginner on a 3D printed mini barrel project?": "\nYour question begins in an inappropriate format for StackExchange, but you've ended it with one more appropriate by asking if Blender would work.\nIf you are willing to take the time to learn Blender, you are certain to discover that it will do as you require, and much much more.

That's why hollow objects printed in this manner must have a hole somewhere to let out the powder contained in the object.\nThis is not only true of metal powder, but any 3D printing process that uses a bed of powder or a volume of resin and fuses some of it into a shape. Fused deposition modelling (FDM), the process used by most consumer-level 3D printers, build models in thin air, so only air is trapped inside the printed objects, making the printing of hollow, enclosed objects less of a problem. Of course, one has to deal with gravity. A hollow object might collapse before the filament hardens enough to support its weight.\n", "hotend - What is stopping us from mixing 3D filament colors in an Extruder?": "\nI just started with google and phrase \"3d printing color mixing\" and on the first place (in fact first two were valueless adverts) I got this Instructables - DIY Full Color Mixing 3D Printer.\nHow it works?\nIt uses magenta / cyan / yellow filaments and mixes it while printing with Diamond hotend.\nIt definitely does what you are asking for and it's exactly the same idea you come up with ;)\nOverview\n\n\nGetting the controller board ready for three extruders...

It's because microwave oven creates oscilations which excites water particles (see microwave explanation here) so assuming PLA doesn't contain water, it won't heat up. (removed to not mislead as the water is not only material which heats up by microwaves. Thanx to Tom van der Zanden for being vigilant)\nBut as usual, it's more complicated.\nFirst. PLA can contain water as while producing it can be cooled down in water bath. Of course well made PLA will have as less water as possible as water has an influence on printing process.\nSecond. PLA is absorbing humidity so in fact it gets water inside right from the air. This unfortunately causes problems in microwave oven.\nWater can be overheated and oven can overheat water above 100C. But even at 100C, PLA will not be hard anymore so your 3 arm star would \"collapse\". Wheels could get oval or start sticking to their axis.\nEventually if high power is delivered to very \"wet\" PLA, I think it can... well maybe not explode but break.\nHere goes a test which shows it can be used to defrost things on PLA plate in microwave\nBut here Daan Snijders claims PLA gets soft in microwave during the test\nWill it be a disaster?\nIn my opinion it will work only for short uses of MW.

It's sometimes true ;)\nSo all your modular things will be better and better if you will increase (what is to be increased) in above points especially \"user skills\".\nIs engineering paramount? It depends of whay you gonna create. If your modular things have to lock itself, have to have threads, screws and such stuff then this is engineering. Is it the most important part of the design? Not necessarily.\nI would say 3D printing moved engineering to next level. I'm talking about this or this.

I don't have the chemical science background to provide proof or evidence, but I operate from an assumption that if the part requires UV rays to cure, it will continue to be reactive to UV rays after it is considered \"cured\". \nI too have found the same brittleness over long periods of time. The only experience I have with the moisture issue would be a small component designed and built for a cable pulley in the tail section of an aircraft as a temporary solution (acting on a non-critical trim control surface). The aircraft is based down here in Houston, Texas where we get some pretty gnarly humidity. The part did begin warping after a few months but we don't have definitive information indicating it was a moisture problem, or something more structural. \nI do know however, that if you aren't absolutely meticulous about cleaning ALL of that gelatin-like support material off of the part, it does wind up being more susceptible to slight deformities, and when you DO remove it all thoroughly,  it is then slightly more susceptible to the brittleness issue. Not sure if I'm the only one finding this, and apologies for not having the chemical background to provide more quantitative support.\n", "heated bed - How do you heat a large glass print bed?": "\nYour best option may be to seek out a silicone rubber heating mat, using those terms for your web search. A quick search on my part shows many resources, some of which are known to the 3d printing manufacturing world, while others are equally suited for that purpose.\nDon't bond the heater to the glass. You'll need to replace it when it breaks. Consider to use borosilicate glass for better heat tolerance and smaller chance of breakage. A quick search for such a large size pane comes up empty, invalidating that suggestion.\nI've read of some people using water bed heaters for large area coverage, but they may heat the area unevenly.\nIt could be to your advantage to use multiple heater panels with temperature controls for each one. This would provide more uniform heating although more complex temperature management.\nI would post links, but there are so many from which to choose.\n", "Filamnt is stuck in nozzl - 3D Printing Stack Exchang": "\nThere are a number of options you could try. If heating up the hotend does not work, you'll have to disassemble it. Remove the nozzle and the heatbreak (the threaded part). To disassemble the nozzle, you will need to heat it up and use pliers or wrenches to unscrew the parts.\n\nYou can use a blowtorch to melt and burn out the plastic that is stuck. Make sure to do this outside.\nYou can use solvents to dissolve the plastic. This works especially well with ABS, which can be dissolved in acetone. You can also try dissolving different plastics with acetone, but for example PLA does not really dissolve in acetone (it does become somewhat soft, so this can still be helpful towards getting it out). You could also try using other solvents if acetone does not work for your particular plastic, but consider these tend to be quite toxic compared to acetone so be careful. Note that in any case, the plastic will need to soak in the solvent for at least a few hours or overnight.\n\nDo not try to disassemble it while cold, the expansion and contraction of metal with heat makes this impossible. When reassembling, be sure to heat up the nozzle before giving it a final tightening (again, this is to make sure that when the nozzle expands as it is heated, it makes a tight seal).\n", "3d design - What is a good software for designing car parts": "\nYou've avoided a number of attributes of a poor question by specifying your objective in detail, while also providing some indication of your experience. AutoCAD is not well known as being 3d printer friendly, although a skilled AutoCAD design user may be able to create acceptable models.\nOne could consider more organic modeling software such as Blender, although it works in reverse of my comment above. It's great for free-form model building but not so much for engineering type construction. Again, a competent Blender user can avail himself of the parametric aspects of the software, but it's more work than one would necessarily desire to engage.\nSolidWorks has a number of followers in the 3d modeling community. My experience with the software has shown me that it can be learned fairly quickly and is powerful enough to allow one to explode creatively over time.\nThe structure of Solidworks workflow fits in directly with your description, both to the reference to accurate modeling as well as the break-apart aspect. The construction of a model in SW is done via sketches and various actions performed on resultant objects created from those sketches. It's not free software, rather pricey, but it may also save you so much work as to pay for itself over time.\nThere are other options, of course, some of which are free to students and hobbyists. I did a quick Google search for \"free parametric 3d modeling software\" which resulted in this link:\nhttps://www.matterhackers.com/articles/finding-the-right-3d-modeling-software-for-you\nYou will find many suitable programs in the list generated from that link, as well as many that are unsuitable for the reasons mentioned previously.\nConsider also to view YouTube videos of your candidate selections. Most of the programs referenced will have tutorial videos which can give you a clearer idea of how well it fits your needs and perhaps how easily it can be understood.\n", "calibration - Kossel accumulates error along Z axis": "\nAfter some more testing I checked that the problem shows up only on Z tower and is not related with current. Examining the tower I found very dumb mistake. Pulley on the motor didn't have a setscrew! Don't know how could I missed that. The fact that it could somehow run is even more amazing. Thanks @tom-van-der-zanden and @darthpixel for help. It is for sure that such synchronization failure could have been caused by current shortage as well.\nUPDATE:\nOh! Y tower pulley doesn't have setscrew as well! But it was running smoothly and in sync with X (which has that screw). Amazing. - UPDATE2. Not really.

The simulation of the entire build process with complex geometry and material addition almost never occurs due to computational cost. For example this work is one of the most sophiticated simulations developed and it is so computationally expensive that only a single laser scan was performed.\nIf what you actually want to achieve is stress/deformation of a FDM part then perform a structual analysis using anisotropic material properties that match that of your printed parts. I would assume that by now data for material properties of FDM parts with respect to machine parameters would be known at least for commonly implemented materials such as ABS and PC.\n", "3d models - What is needed to create dwg from drawing?": "\nIt's not an easy task and according to my knowledge there is no way to do it fully automatically (I might be wrong of course).\nYou have options as follows:\nRead scans and ...\n\nrecreate it manually in CAD application\nrecreate it using a digitizer (in the old days they had pucks - a kind of magnifier with crosslines to digitize from printouts/blueprints)\ncreate 3D object omitting 2D drawings\nconvert bitmap to vectors in 2D app\nuse a scanning service like this (would be expensive)\n\nDepending on complexity of your schemas, the easiest way, would be option 1 or 3.

For example, in AutoCAD use command Imageattach\n", "medical - Can anyone suggest what technology and 3D printing material is most suitable for printing of dental models?": "\nIf resolution is your upmost concern then resin 3d printers are the way to go. They use a liquid resin that does not harden until a UV laser is shined through them. Apparently they get ultra high resolution and smooth finishes right out of the box. The downside is they are generally more expensive machines and the resin material itself is also a higher cost. but if you are in the dental field then money is not a problem. Look into resin 3d printers.\notherwise if you want to try FDM printers then try looking into .1mm brass nozzles which will increase resolution but vastly increase print time. Not sure what material would be best. ABS has toxic smelling fumes, but is the same as LEGOS and is able to be easily smoothed (if necessary) with Acetone fumes. PLA might work well at .1mm nozzle resolution though and is a starch/dextrin based non-toxic biodegradable filament.\n", "pla - Prints are now sticking too well to the bed. What to do?": "\nOptions to check (in order of probability of occurenece and success):\n\nZ-calibration\n\nMaybe you should perform calibration again. It's possible that nozzle is now too close which causes the filament is spread on the heatbed, which causes that the bottom surface is \"too flat\". It means all separate filament tracks are spilled and they create \"glass flat\" surface. You did mention that the model sticks too much even to kapton. It suggests z-calibration.\n\nTemperature calibration\n\nCheck if the temperature is not too high. Reducing it a bit can reduce sticking. If filament is too soft then material sticks usually better (causes the same as in #1)\n\nHeatbed cleaning\n\nIf your HB is scatched (even not visible scratches) then it's possible that previous printouts left little grains in such scratches. Cleaning HB could then help. Are you using glass? if yes - change glass side to check this option. Eventually replace glass with new one.\n\nHeatbed surface\n\nIf your heatbed is scratched then filament can penetrate such scratches and increase sticking.\n\nFilament\n\nDid you change filament vendor? If not then maybe your filament had changed during a time/humidity/sun/cigarete smoke. This is very doubtful option but who knows.\nWhat methods you can use to detach model \n\nPaper knife\n\nI also have the same problem when I use paper glue stick. Some vendors produce such sticky glue that I affraid to break a glass (which I use of course). When this happens I use a paper knife. Glass is scratchproof enough. Be careful - if your model suddenly detaches releasing knife... just be careful. Unmount HB or unmount glass first of course.\n\nHammer\n\nI know people use hammer to detach sticked model. I would suggest this method only for big and relatively simple elements. Especially for solids (fully filled with the material, without any grid/honeycomb inner structure). One short hit in the same surface as the HB. Be careful of course and unmount HB or unmount glass first.\n\nFridge\n\nAs HB material and filament have most likely different thermal shrinkage factor it might help. And guess what - unmount HB/glass first ;)\n", "print fan - Fan Fails to Start": "\n\nIs there a reason why a set of wires, which look perfectly fine from the outside, would fail to run the fan?\n\nThe internal conductor is broken. This can happen over time due to metal fatigue from the constant movement, and the cables getting snagged may indeed have something to do with it. You could try desoldering the current wires from the fan and replacing them with fresh ones, or getting a new fan altogether.\n", "heated bed - What is a good strategy for removing 3d prints from an UNheated Glass bed?": "\nBecause you will be printing on unheated glass, you will be using some form of adhesive material. If you use an off-the-shelf glue stick, you will likely find it is water soluble. If the bed is removable, immersing it in warm water for a relaxing soak will provide easier model removal. \nI don't have experience with various tapes, so will avoid recommendations regarding masking tapes or similar material.\nThermal cycling will also provide release. Not a heat gun, as that will break the glass, but a hair dryer applied to the underside near the model, then cooling. Repeat until it releases.\nI have used the Fleks3D print plate on my Flux Delta printer in the past, and it releases \"like magic\" but I don't think they make monster sheets of your printer size. I had also purchased a pair of 20\" square Fleks3D plates for a similarly sized printer that never materialized. I'd be happy to sell you the pair, but I think they are too small for your full plate.\nIt has been said that one can use sand-blasted acrylic, which I believe is the construction of the aforementioned Fleks3D plates. If you have access to 1/8\" or 3mm acrylic and can apply a uniform blast of abrasive, you may be able to construct your own easy-release build plate.\nIt is practical to consider to use a raft for your large builds. Rafts are useful for small items, to provide a greater bonding surface and avoid release, but it also provides a \"wedging\" location for your release tool. You can more easily slice away the middle of the raft and deal with a thinner layer after the model is completely freed.\nEDIT ADD: If the bed is not removable, one can build a dam around the model with clay to hold the water for dissolving the glue.\n", "extruder - Loss of extrusion in Stratasys FDM liquefier": "\nThis isn't a \"turn this knob and all will be well\" answer, because your machine setup sounds pretty unique to what most people will have experience with. Not being familiar with the older Stratasys printheads, but based on my overall experience with 3D printers, there are three things that could be an issue:\n\nThe nozzles are obstructed. The way you talk about clearing the jams of pushing a tool up through the nozzle end would not effectively clear a jam, it would only push the debris back into the print head, just waiting to be pushed by the plastic back into the nozzle. It could even be a piece of aluminum foil from the rebuild process. The typical way jams like this are cleared is to do a \"cold pull\" where you heat up the hot end just enough to be able to pull the plastic out, before it has really had a chance to liquify, hopefully trapping the debris in the plastic, then cut the end of the plastic off and reload. The 90 degree bend in their design may make this very hard if not impossible to do.\nHeat creep. The tubes are a slightly smaller diameter, and if heat is creeping up the print head and letting the filament expand in these tubes, it may be expanding enough that it will no longer move through the print head. Diagnose this by letting the printer jam, then cool off for a few hours. If you can print again for a short time period before it jams again, this may be your issue, where as an obstructed nozzle would not allow any more filament out. Either turn down your temps, or increase your cooling on the print head to address (or get the original size tubes if possible).\nPrint head temperatures too low for the print speed. The Stratasys Fortus 250mc I use runs ABS at about 300 degrees. Many of the reprap printers run even higher than this for ABS. The other thing to remember when ever you see people mention what temperatures they use, is that this is relative, and only a guide, as what the temperature reads at the thermocouple or thermistor is usually slightly off from the temperature that is melting the plastic based on heater location in relation to the plastic and thermistor. This can be diagnosed by printing until it jams, pause the print for something like 30 seconds to let the hot end melt more plastic, and then resume printing. If resumes proper printing this may be your issue (and it will jam again shortly if you do not adjust temps).\n\n", "3d models - TPU filament usage for dental application?": "\nThere are a Ton of issues with using this type of material.

You would also need to drill access for the cut out then cut the perimetre.\nYou could also consider printing(ABS) in smaller sections then fusing each section together edge to edge(solvent welding of ABS is very strong and permanent), if you were really dead set on using a typical 3D printer for this. It would, in theory, be possible, but it would be very tedious. The adhesives, and cleaner, would be available from any plumbing supply and/or (home depot, lowes, walmart et al.). If you go this route be sure to have ample ventilation and plan your work space well in advance.

In other words, the stepper will for example be told to move 10 steps left, regardless of where it is currently at. If you therefore forcefully move the printhead out of position during the print, the electronics will never know it happened, and continue with instructions that are no longer viable. \nIn order to fix this, do what you can to avoid the nozzle colliding into the model:\n\nMake sure your printer does not leave large deposits of filament, typically due to over extrusion or too close Z-leveling of the first layer.\nMake sure the model sticks to the bed, so that warped parts don't lift up, obstructing the toolpaths.\nAdd Z-lift in your slicer software, so that the printhead lifts slightly between travel moves.\nReduce travel speed (if it is set very high): the strength of stepper motors is lower at higher speeds, which means nozzle collisions at higher speeds most likely will offset the motors.   \n\n", "stepper driver - Ultimaker original X-axis not moving": "\nI'm not sure I know exactly what is wrong or what steps you've taken so far, but it seems like your extruder motor is broken and you've narrowed the problem down to electronics.\n\nIf so, replacing the Arduino, motor, and driver leaves only the Ultimaker PCB as the source of the problem.

You would want to determine initially that the un-segmented model is manifold and 3d printer ready. Once that is determined, consider using an alternate program for your chop-up actions.\nYou do not specify the size of the printer you intend to use, but that is obviously a factor in the segmentation of the model.\nI have some experience with Meshmixer, which has an edit feature named \"plane cut\" which will do as you require. The plane is placed on the model and the options are selected to keep both pieces after the slice is performed.\nFor a huge model of the type you describe, one would hope you have access to a printer with a one meter print bed or larger, although such printers are rare and of course, expensive.\nMy printer has a 200 x 300 mm build plate, up to 200 mm high, which would entail substantial segmenting.\nIf your model is mostly a shell, your segments would have to have wall thickness. It would be best accomplished, again in Meshmixer, by using the hollow or shell features. Those are a bit more challenging to understand, but there are plenty of videos and tutorials specific to creating hollow shells from a solid model. Once the shell is created, segments would be managed easily enough.\nI suggested that your segments would \"have to have\" wall thickness, but it isn't a requirement. Solid segments would be like bricks and you may have a large number of rectangular solids that compose your model. Lego models are difficult or impossible to create with only an outer shell, so the interiors are often solid bricks, but 3d printers are a bit more flexible. Not using solid interiors would save money, of course.\nI envision a jigsaw puzzle in three dimensions.

If you are willing to drop the color requirement, this would be a good choice.\n\nThere are some hobbyist projects to do full color printing, but they are in a rather early stage. One option is colorpod that can be used to convert an FDM printer (such as the Ultimaker, but the principle works with any printer) however it is in a rather early stage of development and not very reliable yet. Another option is Plan B but that is a DIY project and not available for purchase (and is not very mature either).\nThat leaves you with the commercial color options. You've already ruled out the 3D systems/projet machines. Another (slightly cheaper) commercial option is MCOR IRIS but it also runs in the tens of thousands.

The motors and hotend draw only very little power (around 2A, 5A peak), so the 30A supply you have has significant headroom (it is often recommended to derate a power supply by 20%, so a 30A supply would be good for 24A - you're still well under that). It should work fine, even given its dubious provenance.\nWinter versus summer should not make a big difference. The largest power draw is during the heat up phase. In winter, the bed will use slightly more power to stay warm, but regardless of whether it is summer or winter the peak power draw during heat up will be the same.\nThe cheapness of these supplies tends to be reflected in more output ripple (but for heating the bed and running the motors you don't need a very stable voltage) and improper filtering. This may inject noise back into the mains, possibly affecting other equipment nearby. Should this occur, you can just stop using the power supply. However, in my experience, they can deliver the rated power just fine. They're not completely horrible.\nYour biggest concern should be whether the wires that lead to your heated bed can handle the current and whether the screw terminals are properly tightened. During the first use, you should check that the power supply does not get extremely hot. If it's so hot it's impossible to touch for more than 1-2 seconds you should not use it.\n", "heated bed - 12v 25A 300x300 Heater bed Mosfet": "\nI have looked over the 20 or so most expensive MOSFETs in that shop, and none are suitable.\nIt might be easier to go with a DC Solid State Relay rather than a bare MOSFET.\nIf you do want to go with a bare MOSFET instead, a TO-220 package MOSFET can dissipate around 1W without a heatsink, and around 3-4W with one.

This is on the upper edge of what is acceptable without a heatsink, but should still work (junction to ambient resistance is 62C/W, so in the worst case of 2.0m\u2126 the temperature would get to 77C above ambient - the MOSFET is rated for operation up to 175C). With a heatsink it will definitely work well.\nNote that the gate charge is much higher (10x) than that of the MOSFET used on RAMPs so you should use a low switching frequency.\n", "pla - M3D Micro printer stops extruding but is not clogged": "\nI'm not sure how similar the two systems are, but I use a Stratasys uPrint SE Plus and I've run into a similar problem. \nThere are two rollers in the head that pull the filament through to the extruder nozzle, and in one instance they appeared to have heated up, melted the filament enough to create two \"indentions\" on either side of the filament, making it such that the rollers had no purchase on the filament itself. There was never any clog, no material feed error, but it was still failing to print. Wound up having to replace the head altogether.\nAgain, not sure how similar the extrusion mechanics are in the M3D, but suggest checking the components that actually advance the filament, and the filament itself.\n", "What parts are strictly necessary for a 3D printer?": "\nYou will certainly find that the print functionality of a 3d printer is a bit more complex than you suggest. The mechanical portions include a means to push the filament into a heated nozzle as well as the software portion to regulate the speed of the filament movement. You haven't referenced the heater cartridge and temperature sensor, but you will discover that aspect soon enough.\nThe \"air tube\" you think you've seen is likely called a bowden tube. Such designs permit lighter weight print heads, which is beneficial for speed, acceleration and precision, but has complications with respect to compression of the filament as well as retraction considerations. Non-bowden print heads will have the extruder motor as part of the moving assembly, with the drive wheels very close to the nozzle opening. This allows for flexible filament and more precise control of the filament feed. \nEither design has compromises, so one must determine priorities for the design.\nCooling is also a factor. The heater cartridge is designed to heat the nozzle to a specific temperature for the type of filament used, but also requires a means to keep the heat from traveling to the portion of filament not in the nozzle. You'll discover terms such as heat break, referring to narrow threaded portion connecting the nozzle assembly to the heat sink. There will also be a cooling fan to blow air over the heat sink and very often a cooling fan to cool the filament as it exits the nozzle and attaches to the model being printed.\nYou suggest to ignore the mechanics and software, but it's important to be aware of both when considering the principles of the print head assembly.\nSimplified, filament enters bowden tube then into heat sink, pushed by extruder motor (or) filament is pushed into heat sink by extruder motor. Filament travels through heat break, gets melted in heater block and exits nozzle. Sheesh, that's way too simple.\n", "pla - How to create attachable/detachable printed parts": "\nThis question may yet fall into the too-broad category, but I'll give it a shot. \nYou don't want to use glue or adhesives, but does that exclude bolted or screwed fasteners? Threaded inserts are metal \"nuts\" with knurled grip extrusions that enable one to use a matching bolt. The insert is heated with a soldering iron or similar source and embedded into the part. It's especially useful when the part thickness provides sufficient strength and the threaded insert is on the surface of the part opposite the bolt head.\nAnother option you have is to design into the part a \"conventional\" joint such as a dovetail or slot with the matching dovetail or T shape on the adjoining part. This requires access to the end of the part to enable the sliding action of joining them together, of course. Some testing of prints should be performed to ensure proper mating.\nDirectly related to that method is pins and holes. With suitable testing, one would create a hole on both parts and print a pin to match. If one is well versed in the software of choice, one hole with a built-in pin on the adjoining part would work too.\nYet another extension is provided free from 3DKitbash:\nhttp://www.3dkitbash.com/free3dmodels/\nin the form of friction fit pins. I've constructed one of their models using this design and find the straight-line pins eventually work free. The pin model with \"mouse ears\" allows for a bit stronger gripping due to the compression of the shape on insertion.\nThe friction fit pins would be considered to be the snap-fit parts you want to avoid, but the level of expertise should not be beyond that of a model designer. \nTrial and error works wonders when it comes to putting these things together. I printed an Overwatch logo for a fellow makerspace member. The part used a pin on the insert and a hole on the logo. I was astonished when the two different colored parts slid together quite snugly. I have not calibrated my printer and it was indeed a snap together build. On the flip side, when I pried the two pieces apart (low infill) the pin remained in the hole, snapping cleanly off the insert. Should I be asked to do this again, I would have much more infill on the pins.\nFor clarification, consider also to note what software you are using for your design. Some programs lend well to creating connections, others not so much.\n", "pla - Prusa i3 hotend not getting to the temperature that I want (180 to 230 celsius)": "\nUsually, this kind of problem is due to an issue with the control loop of the temperature. You can try to do PID Tuning by running the command M303 E0 S200 C8. This will heat up the hot end and cycle it around 200C a few times, and afterwards tell you Kp, Ki and Kd values which you need to enter into the PID settings of your firmware configuration, or store them in EEPROM using M301.\nIf this does not solve the problem, then disconnect the heater cartridge and check its resistance with a multimeter. For a 12V system, it should not be higher than 6\u03a9 (24\u03a9 for a 24V system).\nIf the heater cartridge is okay, then perhaps it is a problem with the power supply. While the hotend is heating up, measure the voltage across the heater cartridge. It should not be much less than the nominal 12V/24V your printer runs at. If it is, you may have a bad MOSFET or power supply.\nFinally, if you have a very powerful fan blowing on the hotend this can cause issues with heating up as well. Adding a fan shroud (or pointing the fan away from the nozzle and only at the print) can help with this.\n", "abs - Typical plastic strength at 1500 RPM": "\nReally the only thing that would matter for this project is the amount of torque the motor has available and subsequently how heavy your setup is that is connected to the motor. A part that size may just be too heavy for a CD-ROM motor if you intend on adding more parts.\nHowever, to answer your question, ABS should be able to endure the stress. I recommend paying attention to how the hooks are printed. You'll want to make sure that the hooks are printed in profile, meaning that the profile of the hooks should be printed with each layer. This will help provide structural integrity to, what sounds like, the most stressful area of the part (the outer edges of a spinning device and a clamping feature).\nSomething to keep in mind for projects like this is that most of the time the design will likely be the cause of failure, not the capabilities of the material.\n", "Heated bed is not heating anymore": "\ndiagnosing a heated bed\nSwitch the hot end and the heater bed wires on the board. See if there is a difference. (Note that it will not reach a thermal limit when plugged in this way! So don't leave it on too long!)\nAfter that, if you see that your heat increases with the hot end's wires and the hot end being set on in software then you know the issue is likely with the board. At which point try updating / reflashing the board.\nAlternatively, you can try a second board and see if it makes a difference.\nIf the bed does not heat up even using the heater cartridge connectors, then your heated build plate likely needs to be replaced. Or the wire needs to be replaced.\nIf you are running Ramps or a board that uses 2 hot end outputs you can likely reprogram it to use hot end heater 2 as the new output for your heated bed.\n", "filament - How to stop objects with \"floating\" parts from breaking": "\nThe small filaments you remove that hold the parts up are called supports. The one model I located on Thingiverse clearly requires a number of supports, as the model is not easily designed for 3d printing with FDM printers. It would be better printed with SLS, but that's not the focus of your question.\nYou don't specify how large you printed the model, but certainly a scaled-up version will be stronger at the weak points. You will want to use sharp non-shearing cutters to clear away as much of the supports as possible, without torquing on the model.\nAnother option which also reduces the forces on the model body is to use a soldering iron to smooth and clear/cut the supports. If you are able to use cutters and not damage the model, the soldering iron can remove and flatten the remnants of those supports.\nPlease note that if your careful work has resulted in a model that snaps to pieces, your little brother will soon destroy the successfully cleaned up model just as easily.\nIf you have skill with 3d modeling software (Meshmixer and Blender come to mind for such organic models), you can add insignificant items to the model to provide functional support. Would the Rayquaza look fiercer if you 3d printed a cage as an integrated part of the model, using the bars of the cage to provide support?\nI successfully printed a model that was created by an artist unfamiliar with 3d printing restrictions. The support material was wash-away PVA. I provided the model to the \"owner\" who washed away the support material and snapped the legs in two. It's sometimes impossible to solve poor designs. You have a good chance if you build a cage for this one.\n", "Ultimaker Layer Resolution vs Nozzle Size": "\nYou need a certain minimum flow rate to achieve consistent extrusion. Flow rate is the product of print speed, extrusion width (proportional to nozzle size) and print speed. If you use a very small nozzle and very low layer height, you'd need a very high printing speed to achieve a reasonable flow rate. Therefore, it's quite possible this is not a mistake and intentional.\nKeep in mind that Ultimaker uses 2.85mm filament. With a 0.3mm extrusion width, 0.02mm layer height and 60mm/s print speed, you would need a feedrate of 0.06mm/s into your extruder. The extruder might not be able to develop enough force on the filament at such a low speed (which, owing to the small nozzle size, requires a relatively large amount of force).\nThe ultimaker can not print 6 micron layers since the smallest increment the Z-axis can move in is 5 microns. 6 microns is not a multiple of that.\n", "How to properly read dimensions for a 3D printer?": "\nHaving the dimensions of your 3D printer ordered in Length x Width x Height is a common way, but nobody actually decided it.\nI think it has something to do with the 3rd dimension being the \"new\" dimension for printing things, that's why it's appended at the end.\nAdditionally, the first axis on a 2D-coordinate system usually is the horizontal one, so writing Length x Width makes sense for me.\nIf you are unsure you can always test your printer (if you have one) by writing your own G-Code that moves the printhead on a defined axis.\n", "What type filament should I use to produce stamps?": "\nI see three options...\n1. Print with a flexible filament:\n\nMany options: TPU as you pointed out, the flexible PLA that Tom mentioned, and others.  Here's an article with a few options from Matter Hackers\nI'd suggest printing the stamp side down so you get a nice flat stamp with no post processing.  For any wide gaps, mind your bridging...use fillets or chamfers so the \"roof\" of the gap is an upside down V or U shape.\n\n2. Print with any hard filament, but use a rubber mat under the paper.\n\nThe idea here is to use a semi-flexible surface under the paper to help get uniform contact pressure between the paper and the hard stamp.  As long as your stamp holds ink, this should work okay.\n\n3. Print your stamp shape, then use it to make a rubber stamp.\n\nMaking a model and then copying it with your desired non-printable material is a common manufacturing technique that can be used in many situations.  Use of molds for casting and related processes can really expand your possibilities.  Check out Smooth On.  They have several rubber and flexible compounds that you could use for stamps.\n\n", "Should I use different nozzles for different materials?": "\nThere is absolutely no reason to use different nozzles, not even if filaments do require different temperatures.\nThe only exception is when printing abrasive filaments (such as glow-in-the-dark and carbon-fiber) in which case you should use an abrasion-resistant, stainless steel nozzle. This nozzle can also be used to to print \"regular\" filaments but a regular brass nozzle has slightly more favorable properties if you do not require abrasion resistance.\n", "print quality - Height of printed part is incorrect": "\nYou should check that the steps per mm for your Z-axis are set correctly. This depends on the pitch of the leadscrews/threaded rods driving the axis and parameters of your steppers (microstepping and raw steps/revolution). This Calculator.\nMake sure that your layer height is a multiple of a full step of the Z-stepper. The Z-stepper may be disabled intermittently, and when re-enabled it may \"snap\" to the nearest full step position. If your layer height requires microstepping, you may notice it getting rounded down or up due to this.\nFor instance, if a full step were 0.08\u00a0mm, then 0.16\u00a0mm layers would require 2 full steps, printing fine. 0.12\u00a0mm layers would require 1 full step and a half microstep. Due to rounding, some layers might be reduced to 0.08\u00a0mm instead. This might account for the height discrepancy you're seeing (though 0.08\u00a0mm is quite a high, unrealistic amount for a full-step).\n", "diy 3d printer - Hictop prusa I3 clone": "\nThat \"plastic coupler thingy\" is actually a linear bearing, and it consists of a metal shell, and the metal balls roll between the smooth rod and this shell. The plastic part has a channel that guides the balls in a circle.\nIt would be best to replace the entire bearing (metal part+balls+plastic liner). It's probably either an LM8UU (most likely) or LM8LUU bearing.\n3D Printing a new part will not give good results.\n", "3d design - Is it possible to make a hermetic sealed 3D Printed case?": "\nA few thoughts that might help...\nMaterial:\n\nABS can be vapor smoothed with Acetone which results in the layers sort of \"melting\" together to form a smoother, and less porous surface.\nOther plastics can be smoothed with compatible solvents, but I've not tried solvent smoothing with anything other than ABS.  Be careful if you try.\n\nPrint Method:\n\nConsider slightly higher print temps to increase layer adhesion.  You'll likely have to compensate with extra retraction to avoid excessive stringing.\nConsider more perimeter layers and more top/bottom layers.\nThe CF materials are stiffened with chopped CF strands...I think it's a stretch to call them \"reinforced\" unless you happen to have a Markforged printer or similar.\n\nSealants: This is probably your best bet.\n\nEpoxy: Generally considered effective for producing hermetically sealed containers.  Dip or brush on.  Mind your VOC's and pay attention to working time.\nPlasti-dip or similar sealants: These may be good enough for your application and result in a rubbery coating over your part.  Good for water sealing, and may be close enough to hermetically sealed for your needs.\n\nDesign:\n\nTo mechanically seal the opening, there are many options depending on your requirements.  O-rings, gaskets, etc.  If you use a rubberized dip, you may be able to skip the gasket.  You could install a few threaded inserts around the perimeter of the opening, put in the screws, then dip.  After drying, you slice around the screw and remove it (this just keeps the coating out of your threads)  Dip the cover as well.  Then when you screw on the cover, it will provide a water-tight seal.  To help make a good seal, apply a silicone grease to the mating surface.\n\nI hope this helps.  :-)\n", "simplify3d - Laybrick - Gaps on top layer": "\nWhen using Simplify3D, you may try referring to their awesome troubleshooting guide: https://www.simplify3d.com/support/print-quality-troubleshooting/#holes-and-gaps-in-the-top-layers\n3 reasons (from the guide) for gaps in the top layers:\n\nunder-extrusion: you may try to increase extrusion multiplier to see if this helps\nlow infill percentage: not likely in your case if increasing number of top layers did not help\nnot enough top layers: you already tried increasing number of top layers.\n\nIn addition to that, you may change certain parameters (such as extrusion multiplier) for a given number of layers by using Simplify3D features.

Since you asked for \"steps\" here you go:\nStep 1. Choose a safe material: \nConsider chemical safety and physical safety. Food grade PLA should be chemically safe, but could be too brittle depending on the design you choose.  PETG, T-Glase, or similar filaments (depending on dye) are normally also chemically safe and are less brittle than PLA so may be a better alternative.  ABS is NOT typically considered safe for food contact.\nStep 2. Choose a safe design: \nIf using PLA, be sure the design is robust enough to ensure it won't break.  Broken rattles with sharp edges make baby...sad.  Even less brittle filaments can still break with jagged edges if the design is fragile.\nStep 2a. Choose a single piece design: \nChoose a design that requires you to add the peas (or other safe filler) during the print such that the finished rattle is fully enclosed.  This will minimize parts becoming loose or peas spilling and minimize choke hazards.\nStep 3. Consider post processing to improve safety:\nSanding could reduce ridges and minimize crevices that could harbor bacteria, but sealing it with a food-safe sealant may be more effective.  There are many sealants that the FDA considers safe, but polyurethane or food-safe epoxy finishes will work well with PLA. (If you use a different material, test to verify good adhesion.)\nStep 4. Test:\nMake a test rattle and run it through the paces.  I guess you could chew on it, but since babies don't have teeth, this might invalidate your data...\nStep 5. Consider alternatives such as professional printing services:\nIf your tests don't inspire confidence, professional services can offer additional materials (metals, ceramics, etc.) that could be safer than a typical fused filament printer.\n", "filament - 3d Key not strong enough": "\nI must admit, I've never printed a key...but I think I can help anyway:\nPrint method:\nConsider printing on side, solid concentric infill.

If so, what size?": "\nObviously being in a rush can limit your options, but here are a few thoughts:\nQuick solutions:\n\nBlue painters tape (as Carl mentioned) will work directly on your heated bed...assuming it's a flat piece of aluminum with the heating element under it.  Your surface does need to be flat.\nAcrylic plate will work but is best with no heat, or low heat.  PLA sticks to it.  It's easy to cut and easy to find at local hardware stores.\nScrap glass is fairly easy to find for free and it's not that hard to cut...or buy some at your local hardware store and have them cut it.  Just be careful, it's sharp. You can sand the sharp edges (wet sandpaper) to make it safer.  No, it doesn't have to cover the whole plate, but obviously covering the whole plate would normally be preferred.\n\nBetter (but not as fast) solutions:\n\nBuy some custom tempered glass.  I like One Day Glass because they're fast and very capable.  Like Tom says, many many people print on glass because it's nice and flat and stiff.  It's also easy to clean and holds up well.  You can print on the bare glass with many materials or use various preparations like PVA (glue stick or white glue diluted with water are popular), hairspray, or others.\nTouch Screen Glass: Some people like replacement glass for tablets or touch screens because it has a hardened scratch-resistant surface.  I've not tried it, but if you can find one that is the right size, it might be worth a shot.\nSpecialty products: There are many many print bed products out there that promise an easier/better printing experience.  I've used a few that are okay...definitely better than blue painters tape, but I much prefer my current favorite...\nMy current favorite is PEI. Use a 3M 468MP adhesive sheet (it handles the heat well) to stick a thin sheet PEI (also sold under brand name Ultem) on top of your glass plate.  I got this idea from Lulzbot and it's what they use on all of their printers.  It works beautifully.  Common filaments stick to it while it's hot and release easily while it's cool.  For other filaments I just use PVA like I would over glass.  For material printing tips and settings that work well on PEI beds, check out Lulzbot's site.  When it starts wearing out or getting scuffed up, I just sand it with fine sandpaper and I'm good to go for another hundred prints or so.\n\n", "pla - Poor adhesion only for first couple of inches": "\nI've had this problem in the past with a Flux Delta printer.

If you switch the wires over to the secondary fan output it will work correctly.\nIf you do want to use the primary fan output then you can achieve this by setting #define EXTRUDER_0_AUTO_FAN_PIN 7 but you will need to search for the #define FAN 8 in the appropriate pins.h file and change 8 to something else (-1 or 7, for example).\nI would recommend the first solution, because you should have a controllable print cooling fan, and an automatic extruder cooling fan.\n", "marlin - When leveling hotend always slams into bed?": "\nI realised the simplest fix for this shortly after posting the question.

Some have been done, others have not (I think), but all of them are feasible.\nScrolling Conveyor-type Bed:\n\nIn this concept, parts become dislodged from the print surface as it is deformed around a roller in the process of scrolling to the next position.  Scrolling bed designs must make allowances to prevent parts from lifting up the bed material which becomes an issue especially with warp-prone materials.  Note: This is the basis of the Automated Build Platform (ABP) originally designed (as far as I can tell) by Charles Pax and later covered in several patents by Makerbot Industries.\n\nDeforming Bed:\n\nIn this concept, the bed is mechanically deformed when the part removal temperature has been reached.  This deformation dislodges the part which can then be easily swept off of the bed by an arm or similar mechanism.  (As far as I know, this concept has not yet been demonstrated.)\n\nArticulated Segmented Bed:\n\nIn this concept, the bed is comprised of several strips. Slightly lowering a portion (let's say half) of the strips would separate them from the part, then slightly raising that portion would separate the part from the remaining strips.  (As far as I know, this concept has not yet been demonstrated.)\n\nEject and Replace Bed:\n\nThis method ejects the entire bed surface along with the finished parts and then receives a fresh print surface for the next print.  This method would likely still require intervention to remove parts from used print surfaces and then return them to the clean stack. (As far as I know, this concept has not yet been demonstrated.)\n\nPlow:\n\nThis method mentioned by Fred_dot_u and AllanL uses a specially designed plow arm to sweep parts off the bed between prints.  This method has been effectively demonstrated in this video by New Valance Robotics Corporation that was mentioned by AllanL (thanks!).\n\nIssues using print head to eject parts:  While this method has been tried, and demonstrated (see below), it has some challenges/drawbacks.\n\nTypical FDM/FFF 3d printers are not designed to apply significant force behind print head movements.  While a printer designed specifically for this purpose could be built, using a typical printer in this way is extremely likely to cause the stepper motors to loose steps and result in loss of position accuracy unless parts separate very easily. (however, position could easily be regained by zeroing via limit switches between prints.)  \nIn addition to skipping steps, mechanical issues such as ratcheting/skipping belts or unwanted frame movement could result from even moderately stuck prints.\n\nExamples of pushing or ramming parts off of bed:\nWhile using various parts of the printer to push parts off of the bed may not be an ideal solution, it may be an adequate solution for specific circumstances.  Here are a few demonstrations of the \"ramming\" method.\n\nRamming parts off with frame and moving bed like this.\nRamming part with robust print head like this.\nRamming easy to remove part with print head like this.\n\nInteresting question.  I hope this helps!\n", "color - How are SLS printers able to print multiple colours?": "\nThe Z-corp/3D systems printers lay down what is essentially ink in each layer (only around the perimeters) much like an inkjet printer, dying the powder as the parts are made. This means they can make almost any color at any point in the model. The down size is these models are pretty fragile, at least the last ones that I have handled. This can be helped by dipping them in cyanoacrylate and letting them dry. \nAs pointed out in the comments, this is not an SLS process, but looks very similar. The printer lays down a binder (clear or colored) on each layer, and is why these models are much more fragile than SLS models, which are very strong.\nHere is an example of some prints: http://mcad3dprintingandprototyping.blogspot.com/\n", "Slic3r msh mrging - 3D Printing Stack Exchang": "\nTry using Autodesk Meshmixer.

While 184C can be hot enough, it is very near the bottom of the range for PLA and it appears your filament isn't melting quickly enough to keep up with your other settings.  Your extruder may even be running slightly cooler than you think so your 184C setting may actually be printing at 180C or less.\nTo solve this:\n\nRaise your extruder temperature. I suggest raising your print temperature to 220 degrees and then gradually lower it until other aspects of your print quality are acceptable (bridging, oozing, etc).\nSlow down your print. Slowing down reduces the volume of melted plastic your extruder has to deliver in a given amount of time.  This allows more time for the plastic to melt and allows you to use a lower print temperature\n\nYour filament feed mechanism may be slipping.  Even if you have adequate temperature and perfectly calibrated firmware and print settings, if your filament feed mechanism (the thing that pushes filament into your extruder) is slipping, you will have under-extruded parts.\nTo solve this:\n\nMake sure you have adequate tension on your filament feed mechanism.  If your feed mechanism is too loose, filament may slip and cause under extrusion.  The part to check is the part the pushes the filament into the rotating hobbed bolt or friction wheel...make sure it applies adequate pressure.  \"Adequate pressure\" or \"adequate tension\" will vary depending you your printer's design, but it should be enough to provide a firm grip on the filament.\nVerify your feed mechanism is clean.  A hobbed bolt or similar filament drive mechanism that has become clogged or otherwise contaminated may cause filament to slip and under-extrude.\nEnsure the end of your filament is not damaged from slipping.  Once your filament has slipped, it may be damaged with a worn spot, a bulge, or some other defect that can prevent proper feeding even after you fix the root cause of your problem.  So, as tbm0115 pointed out, be sure to clip off the damaged end to make sure you have good filament feeding into your extruder.\n\nI hope this helps!\n", "Good sources of filament \"sampler\" pack?": "\nAmazon, of course.

Having zero layer thickness for the top/bottom also prevented features from printing that were composed of only walls without infill. Small details that otherwise print well were lost completely.\nI can see that properly designed models printed with certain infill patterns and percentages would be quite artistic.\nWith respect to the first question, one could create a program to accomplish the desired result if one were an experienced programmer. It would be a matter of converting a specific set of vectors into g-code for the printer.

However, the smaller nozzle size will need a bit more time to adhere to other objects (see above).\nStandoff distance: The distance between the nozzle and build plate, a.k.a standoff, should be a bit smaller with the nozzle size. Typically people use the paper reference (using a piece of paper to \"calibrate\" the standoff), which is about 0.004\".\nMake sure your slicing engine knows the change! Most slicing software will allow you to adjust the nozzle size. This can also be used to fine-tune your machine.\nBeware of clogging: Clogging is usually a result of poor cooling between your heater block and your drive gear, poor filament quality, and/or incorrect extrusion rates.

This is primarily driven by temperature coefficients and thermal conductivity of the individual materials. There are calculators available online that you can get more involved with discovering how this works mathematically.\nHowever, in layman's terms, the temperature between your build plate and the first layers of plastic are so drastically different, that at a certain point the plastic becomes under tension as it shrinks faster/more than the build plate. Over time, since the surface tension between the part and the build plate is no longer in the way, the corner can continue to shrink.\nHere are some options:\n\nEnsure your build plate temperatures are correct acceptable. I've had success with 112C in NW United States. Increasing the temperature will be an attempt to bridge the gap between BP temps and plastic temps during the final cool-down.\nSearch for ways to \"anchor\" the part to the build plate. There are lots of resources on the internet on how to do this, so I'll spare you the list.\nIncrease your environment temperature. I highly suggest this because it can help reduce other errors you might encounter throughout the printing process, such as de-lamination, warping, brittleness, etc. I'm not recommending placing a space heater next to your printer (really, don't do that!), but perhaps even a space heater in the room can help regulate the environment temperature a bit better.\nConsider other environment variables. Consider things like \"Is my printer next to a window?\", \"Do I live in a particularly cold environment in general?\", or even \"Am I baking cookies in the next room?\".

The feedrate is specified in the G-Code file. A command like\nG0 X10.0 Y15.0 Z3.0 F9000\n\nindicates a move to (10,15,3) at a feedrate of 9000 mm/min.

You're trying to find something in the code that simply isn't there. Your slicer is responsible for generating a g-code file, which you can then send to your printer (either by printing from an SD-card) or using a host program like repetier or cura. The commands in the G-code file are then executed by the firmware, but they're not part of it.\nHow the commands are actually processed is not trivial, and it happens in multiple places.\nThe commands are processed in the process_commands of Marlin_main.cpp. Upon reading a G1 command, it calls get_coordinates to parse the X/Y/Z/feedrate values from the command. Next, the prepare_move function is called, which applies the necessary transformations (clamping to endstops, and the reverse kinematics if you have a delta) before calling plan_buffer_line (which is in planner.cpp) which does some more preprocessing and computes a \"block\" which is pushed onto the buffer. Next, planner_recalculate is called, which iterates over the blocks to find feasible acceleration patterns for them. Finally, an interrupt (in stepper.cpp, ISR(TIMER1_COMPA_vect)) periodically reads blocks from the buffer and actually sends the signals to the steppers.\n", "marlin - RCBugFix what is it? - 3D Printing Stack Exchang": "\nIt refers to a specific branch of the current project, named RCBugFix.

However, as it's so up-to-date, it's also not thoroughly tested and possibly quite unstable.\n\nThe latest Release Candidate lives in the \"RC\" branch.

Perhaps the belt or a gear is worn out missing some piece so it slips sometimes. Or the gear its a little loose on its axle. When machine is off you can move the extruder by hand and try to feel if it does so smoothly. \nI would not think its electrical but first thing to do is to detach all cables and put them back, because its easy to do. Second is the dismount stepper motor and check that its gear is attached firmly. If there is a bad cable then flexing and pulling it slightly might escalate the problem so that its always broken, which can be a good thing since intermittent problems are so hard to find.\nIf its the stepper motor driver electronics then a new driver board is needed, last thing to try unless you have two machines and can borrow a part.\nI emailed makerbot support once about another problem, I did get some advice that way.\n", "prusa i3 - Z axis top brackets, of P3Steel, differ between v1.x/2.x and v4": "\nI've just seen this right now, I'm Alvaro Rey, the designer of the p3steel v4 mod. The change was made, because with previous versions with the extruder homed, if you go up in the Z axis, the extruder motor could hit the Z axis top plate. So, in order to avoid that, I just changed the design.\nThe bearing in the z axis is not necessary but some people prefer to use it, in order to avoid wobble in the threaded rod. \nAnyways, I designed a printer part to fix the bearing in the Z top plate.\n", "diy 3d printer - How to offset my probe so it's not hanging off the bed at 0, 0 position when printing": "\nThere are at least 2 options to address the problem that you have:\n\nAdjust end-stops so that in 0,0 position Z-sensor would still hang above the printing table.

Removing the arm on the switch is taking away the lever. Going back to simple machine mechanics, the lever gives you a larger range of motion in which the button could be triggered, with the tradeoff that you get a larger target to hit. How much of an improvement depends on the exact switch, where the button is compared to the axis of the switch, and how long the switch is. \nMy Shapeoko 3 CNC router has a switch for all three end stops that do not have arms, and my Original Prusa i3 mk2 has switches without lever arms on X and Y axis endstops, so there is is no reason it won't work for your i3 Z axis, you just need to make sure you can accurately hit the small button on the switch.\n", "How do the E commands in G-code work, exactly?": "\nYes, the absense of an EX.XXX (or an EX.XXX with the same value as the previous one) means nothing will be extruded during the move.

I know this is not the answer you are looking for but unless you can code a new driver to work for Linux thats the only solution.\n", "print quality - Does the amount of figures on the board matter?": "\nNo, that's not (entirely) true. There might be some loss of quality if you print multiple objects at once, because when the printhead \"hops\" from one object to another it might leave a mark or ooze out some material. Also, a large number of retractions in a short period of time might lead to inconsistent extrusion.\nHowever, none of this is particular to \"filling out the board\" as it happens even if you print only two objects at a time (or even when you're printing only one object with multiple islands).\nIt all depends on your printer (and in particular how well it handles retractions). If you're willing to do a small amount of cleanup afterwards (to remove the strings and blobs) then printing multiple objects at a time is completely viable.\n", "troubleshooting - While filament loading extruded filament wiggles": "\nIt might be similar to this issue (where teflon tube wasn't installed what caused softening filament inside heatsink)\nPlease check if your extruder is equipped with proper pipe inside (inner pipe diameter).\nBut the most probable cause is that a pipe had slide out so filament has enough room to get soft and to form such shape going out. Please take a look also here.\nHere is a situation and its evolution.\n\nfig. A:\n1. filament\n2. teflon tube (well positioned)\n3. heatsink\n4. nozzle\n5. extruded filament\nfig. B:\n6. slided out teflon tube\n7. empty space (heat)\nfig. C:\n8. bent filament\nfig. D:\n9. teflon tube\n10. no extrusion\nHow it happens?\nTeflon tube is usually well positioned so everything is fine in most cases. Sometimes because of poor filament (not-constant diameter) or because of bends on filament, teflon tube is slided out os its place while retraction. It goes on and on, up and up (fig.B)\nOnce tube is extended that much so filament starts to bend in empty (heat) space (fig.C) It increases the effect of sliding out teflon tube just because of bend (it works as a hook). But it can still work. Teflon tube can even be pressed back inside the nest.\nNow because the empty space is heat then filament starts to melt (for example when there is no extrusion for a second) it becomes soft. When filament is soft enough it doesn't extrude as the force to press it throught the nozzle is too high for such soft material so filement definitely stops extruding itself. (fig.D) This situation cannot be fixed automatically. There is a need of user intervention.\nNow you know why some extruders has a rim (or collar) on the top of heat barier tube. It secures a teflon tube from sliding out.\n", "3d models - Printing a non-self-aligning caged deep-groove ball bearing": "\nTwo aspects of your question can immediately be addressed, one with much less certainty than the other.\nIf you were to print the indicated parts using PLA on an FDM printer and assembled as much as possible up to say, the outer bearing ring, you might be able to use boiling water to soften the ring with boiling water enough to get it around the balls. It's also possible that the deformation will effectively destroy the usefulness of the part.\nOn the other item, SLS is virtually perfect for this type of part. The un-sintered nylon powder provides positional support for all of the other parts being sintered. When the print is completed, the powder is blown out with high pressure air, freeing up the individual components as per the original design.\nBe advised that there is to be expected some shrinkage of the parts which will affect any segment of the component that has tight or close clearances.\nFrom Shapeways site regarding SLS printed parts (Shapeways)\n\nExecutive summary:\nmaintain a wall thickness of at least 1mm,\naccuracy is 0.1mm,\nalways keep a clearance of 0.6mm\nand parts may have a deviation of 0.2mm.\n\nWhen designing something mechanical that has to be 3D printed or when adding a mechanical feature to your model there are several main considerations.\n\nAlso listed in the above link are the considerations of enclosed parts. Each of the balls in the bearing design may or will be printed as a hollow sphere filled with nylon powder. The bearing rings will also be printed as shells, unless appropriate steps are taken to make them solid.\nBy the same token, if a part need not be solid and can be designed with holes to \"drain out\" the un-sintered powder, the cost will be reduced accordingly.\n", "3d design - Converting Injection Molded STLs to printable STLs": "\nAlthough the foundation of your question is aimed at getting an opinion, I find nothing wrong with that, as long as answers are provided with an equal foundation based on facts.\nI'm a fan of Meshmixer (free) but it's not well suited for this project, in my belief (opinion) as it's primarily aimed at organic modeling. On the flip side of this point is the fact that you have a working STL from which to build. Meshmixer will enable you to extrude the portions that sit below the surface level and create a flat plane. You can also \"bridge\" the elevated portions into a plane, but only if you remove the lower panels first. Leaving them in place creates an unprintable model.\nOf course, Meshmixer has its own learning curve. \nAlong the same train of thought, Blender (free) is suited for performing similar tasks, again aimed at organic models. Again, starting with your STL makes it less of a complication.\nUnfortunately, in my opinion, Blender's learning curve is substantially steeper, as the program does many things unrelated to 3d printing. It has spectacular control over the model and if you are able to learn the necessary controls and sequences, there isn't anything you can't do with it.\nMeshmixer is more intuitive than Blender and therefore easier to learn. You may also find it easier to find YouTube resources for Meshmixer actions than similarly for Blender, mostly because the phrasing of your search will be clearer with Meshmixer.\nAs an example, one would create face groups of your STL. Various segments would then turn colors. You select the depressed face group and say, \"cheer up\" then delete that group. Using the appropriate tool, which currently escapes my alleged mind, you'd then bridge those faces remaining after the delete. What was once a shallow pool becomes a flat contiguous surface.\nI would recommend using Lynda.com tutorial material if you can find it. There is also a resource called Honeypoint which somewhat specializes in Meshmixer tutorials.\nNot out of the question is to engage the free Fusion 360 program and use all those YouTube resources, among others, to import your STL and create extrusions and modifications you require. Our local library has an agreement with Lynda.com which provides free access to Lynda.com's tutorial library. Conveniently for me, it has a great collection for Fusion 360.\nI've become so accustomed to manipulating models in the above software and other programs that I attempted to rotate your image to see the other side! If this is one of the simpler ones, you have quite a job ahead of you!\nBe sure to use an STL printability checker program to ensure your resulting models are workable. Meshmixer has that feature built in and a couple online services will repair your model free. One service I attempted to use destroyed the model, while the Microsoft version did not, but created a .3MF format. That added one more step to get it reconverted to .STL, but the results justified the effort.\nGood luck\n", "prusa i3 - Alignment of dual Z-axis steppers": "\nAll the Prusa-based designs I've seen have only one end stop.  While you are correct that it's theoretically possible for the two Z-drives to get out of sync, it's very unlikely in practice (barring serious friction, binding, etc.).  \nBut even if it happens, remember that the endstop microswitch is only used to keep the extruder assembly from crashing into the print bed.  The stepper motors do not have shaft encoders, or any other position sensing mech, so if they were to get out of sync, there'd be no way to know this.  \nThe reason there's provision for a stop mount, on both sides, is simply to make the physical parts of the frame the same.  \nThat said, it is important to check the extruder support assembly to verify it's level as you build the printer - \"level\" meaning both supports are the same distance from the screw-drive shaft couplers.\n", "prusa i3 - Z-axis steppers and bed alignment problems": "\nI assume you did everything according to the instructions but here is a checklist of what could be possibly wrong:\n\nFriction - check if you can rotate/move parts without lot of resistance\nScrews - check if screws on couplings are tight and they don't slide over a shaft or thread\nStepsticks - check if they are cooled properly and similar (as there are two of them)\nCarriage nuts on threads - check if they do not slide out of their nests while [the x-axis] carriage goes up\nFilament - check if filament unrolls without resistance which can eventually cause [the x-axis] carriage to hang.\n\nIMO #2 and #3 are the most possible cause\n\n", "Does a 5 axis 3D printer have any benefits over a regular 3 axis printer?": "\nOne aspect of having this level of control with 3d printing of a model is the removal of the need for supports and the attendant post-processing. In the case of the model shown in the video, some effects are created by printing the continents in a conformal manner that would otherwise be impossible with conventional 3d printing. Cosmetically, the results of the \"5d\" printer are superior in this example.\nThere would also be some structural benefit for models with high organic content, that is curves and bulges, as opposed to orthogonal designs. Even with orthogonal designs, one can achieve stronger parts with cross-layered plastic in all directions, rather than being limited by x and y filament layers.\nI see on the web site that one can exchange tool heads as well. One could print a 3d model, layering the filament on all the surfaces, then use a tool head change to a milling bit and smooth the surface under CAD control.  Alternatively, one could use foam or wood and mill a model shape to be covered with a 3d printed material.\nConsidering the relative novelty of this product, it's likely that many aspects of the creative utility have yet to be discovered!\n", "3d models - How can I convert .STL file to .OFF to use in CGAL?": "\nIf you can handle a single intermediate step, you may find that OpenSCAD will perform as required.

A thermistor changes resistance based on the temperature at the junction.  A thermocouple generates a small voltage (mV range) which varies depending on the temperature.  Higher temps typically use a thermocouple because thermistors tend to not be as accurate at those elevated temps.\nMy printer uses thermocouples, and it appears that yours does also.  I'm not sure what you mean by \"crushed\", but you can check to see if the wires are shorted to the heat block or to each other.  It is unlikely that you've damaged the input to the control board by doing this.  Shorted wires can give the same readings as no thermocouple attached.  You can also get errors induced through ground isolation if wires are shorted to the heating block.\nChanging this out for a different system with a different input amplifier sounds like a nightmare in the making, and I'd only attempt it if I could not fix the existing problem or find a direct replacement.\n", "print quality - Second layer: gaps, poor adhesion": "\nI wouldn't describe that as an \"OK\" first layer.

This method might work for a metal printer as well if you could get the temperatures right. This might be cheap enough a hobbyist could do it as well because you just need the same parts as a normal FDM 3d printer just able to more more weight. \nBut with the same parts you could also do lost pla casting and that would be a simpler approach with a better end product.    \nBut probably what you would be really interested in building would be a laser sintering 3D printer. Where a layer of powder is put down and then a laser melts part of the powered to join it to the model. For this the main thing you need would be the laser.

A quick google search returns nothing 3d printer related to \"black vera plastics\" other than a reference to vera bradley, vera wang and an obscure reference to a woven black carpet with white spots of increasing size. \nEven within those limitations, one can certainly print a strip of black with white dots. One method involves a dual extruder printer, enabling two colors to be printed, one layer at a time. The black layer would be extruded with suitable holes and the white layer would be place within those holes.\nAnother method involves printing the black layer with holes, swapping out the filament with white and creating white plugs of appropriate sizes for the necessary fit.\nYou've used the term calibration plate, which implies some level of precision. Is the precision related to spacing, dot size, dot color, or a combination of the above?\nSuch requirements may make the cost slightly higher, but not excessively. I can print up to to 290 mm long strip, possibly longer by going diagonal on my 290 mm print bed, with or without the two colors done simultaneously.\nIf you require crisp edges to the white/black transition, the holes-and-plugs method will give best results and require a bit of post processing. It may be necessary to ream the holes to correct diameter and sand the plugs to fit. Dual extrusion rarely provides sharp delineation from one color to the next.\n", "heated bed - Steel versus MDF/Aluminium Y axis plate?": "\nI have not used MDF for building a printer before; but, I have used it for other projects.  It has the advantage of being very flat (initially); but, it has a LOT of issues with moisture.  It is basically just a compressed slurry or water-based glue and sawdust.  If you expose it to humidity or water it will swell like a sponge.  I would not consider it for anything that requires a dimensional stability.  For that, Aluminum is your better bet.\nRegarding the material properties of AL vs MDF, here is a good comparison:\n\nNote that while MDF has about 1/4 the density of AL, it has a MUCH lower Elastic Modulus (1/17 of AL) For the same thickness, it MDF is MUCH easier to bend than AL.  Also note the strength to weight ratio of AL is also better.\nEven at twice the thickness, my calculations indicate that, for the same load, 6mm MDF would deflect about twice as far as 3mm AL. Also when AL exists its elastic region it becomes plastic (bends) where MDF breaks.\nAnother aspect to consider is flammability.  There a lot of heat sources around an FDM printer and if you are planning on a heated bed, there is one right there under the bed.  Where MDF is hard to ignite, it is flammable and does not respond to heat well.  On the other hand, AL can handle temperatures over 1000 degC and is a great thermal conductor for a bed heater.\nI would definitely choose AL over MDF for you printer bed. \nAnother option to consider it is using a bare PCB (like FR4).  The material is really strong (it is fiberglass), is relatively inexpensive, and is fire resistant (hence the\"FR\" in the name).  Some commercial printers use FR4 for their print bed.  One disadvantage is that is can sometimes develop a curl and there is really no way to get it flat again.\n", "build plate - How can I determine whether my borosilicate glass is fake or not?": "\nGoogle turned up this thread: http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?t=96214\nThere don't seem to be any easy, definitive tests.

And near the big circle it looks better even on far end. And there are \"waves\" close to big circle.\nHow is that possible?\nAssuming that your extruder works well it might be caused by bending bowden tube.

You can get a reasonably accurate measure of the power by looking at the duty cycle of the heating element.\nActually, its not clear if your primary goal is to reduce energy/maintain a very high temperature, or speed the initial heating. You can place a temporary sheet of cork on top of the bed (preferably extending over the edges to prevent convection) and this will significantly improve heat-up times.\n", "firmware - How to directly send G-code to printer from a Linux terminal?": "\nFor direct low-level printer control from a terminal, without specific software, I found the following solution with full credit thanks to user: http://stackexchange.com/users/6463673/meuh\nSharing here as may be of use to other users in the 3d Printing community, and I was unable to source a \"complete\" solution to this elsewhere.\n\nStep 1)\nCreate a custom python script that allows you to set arbitrary baud rates (make executable with chmod u+x).\n#!/usr/bin/python\n# set nonstandard baudrate.

Consider using silicone, teflon or glass fiber insulation instead, especially near the heating element. If the resistor's leads are long enough they might stay cool enough for regular PVC insulation, but make sure you insulate the part of the leads closer to the resistor appropriately.\nSolder: if close to the heater itself, the solder might melt. Consider using silver solder, or using a mechanical connection (ferrule/crimp) instead. Again, this might not be a concern if the leads of the resistor are long enough.\nFlexibility: given that the extruder (probably) moves a lot, use flexible wire (stranded, not solid core) and provide strain relief (especially near the connections, and avoid creating too sharp bends).\n\nFinally, resistors have fallen out of favor compared to ceramic heating elements. Since they are inexpensive and solve all of the above problems (the leads are already attached and appropriately insulated) consider using a ceramic heater instead.\n", "g code - What is the purpose of asterix (*) in Gcode?": "\nThat is a checksum.

Firstly, when researching topics such as this, you will have far more luck using 'additive manufacturing' as a search term rather than '3D printing'. In the professional industrial environment, '3D printing' is not a term that is really used to describe the manufacturing you are talking about.\nSelective laser melting is the additive manufacturing process most suited to metallic aerospace parts. Inconel alloys can be processed (e.g. IN718 being one of the easiest) along with titanium (almost exclusively Ti6Al4V). As for manufacturing turbine blades and similar parts, you might find this interesting: Additive Manufacturing - Breakthrough with 3D printed Gas Turbine Blades.\nTitanium is not typically used in high-temperature sections of gas turbines, but will be used in larger, cooler components such as fan blades, where it's strength to weigh ratio is a benefit (less mass to rotate = better fuel efficiency).\nCoating of high-temperature nickel superalloy components is usually performed with electron beam physical vapor deposition (EBPVD) or thermal spray such as high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF); each process has certain characteristics that dictate when/where is it used. \nThis is only really a surface depth answer to your questions, but it would be impossible to answer fully here!\n(My experience: PhD student using selective laser melting with aerospace alloys)\n", "slicing - Missing top layers in Cura": "\nWhat is your source model?

Lets say your wires come undone and happen to come next to the other lead. If it archs and happened to be in just the right position. Pretty unlikely. Once I did a bad solder job and when I was working on my printer. The wires literally burst into flame in my lap. No damage done (other than needing a new board). That said we often see people who have their boards catch fire in the flashforge owner groups. Weak solder joints, and over all bad quality.\nDo you really have something to worry about with Cork? No. A series of unfortunate events would have to happen, and more likely your board will cause a fire. That said I would look into adding a layer of aluminum and reflect some of that heat back up. \nIf you are that worried I would just remove the sheet. Unless you are having issues calibrating you heated build plate / PIDs there is no reason to use insulation. I only use it on printers that have a hard time hitting ABS temps of 100c. Even then I only use tin foil and try to trap the air underneath. \nJust a side note. If you are having heated build plate issues maybe what you really need is a heat chamber.\n", "electronics - Using CAT6 cables for 3D printer motor / sensors / fans": "\nThe ampacity question is not completely answerable because CAT6 does not specify wire gauge, so the current limit will depend on the specific gauge you get. CAT6 can be anywhere from 22 AWG to 24 AWG, and depending on who you ask this can be good for as much as 7A or as little as 0.5A. Given that you will have a bunch of wires in a bundle, this may cause them to heat up more than if they were in free air. For the steppers (1-2A) a single wire should suffice, but for the heater (around 3-4A) you might want to double up.\nEMI will likely not cause any problems regardless of how you wire things up. CAT6 cables have the wires twisted in pairs of 2. Some people recommend to take advantage of these pairs: the +12V and GND of the heater should use a pair, each of the two coils of the steppers should have their own separate pairs. The reasoning behind this is that with equal current flowing in opposite directions in each wire of the pair, the generated electromagnetic fields will cancel out.\nTwisted pairs are usually used when dealing with multiple pairs of wires that are carrying high frequency signals that might affect each other. The main concern for crosstalk in this application is if the stepper motor might cause the endstop to be erroneously triggered, but this is only a concern during homing when the feedrate (and thus frequency of the signal) is low anyways.\n", "Extruder stepper motor problem, what can be wrong?": "\nYour controller board probably requires calibration.\nIt sounds like, maybe, the extruder's stepper motor is not receiving sufficient current, to make it turn. Or, somewhat confusingly, maybe the stepper is receiving too much current, and overheating.\nYou don't say which controller board you are using, but regardless, there should be an adjustable potentiometer on the board, next to each of the stepper drivers, or on the stepper driver daughter boards.  Like so,\n\nThis potentiomenter adjusts the reference voltage used to control the stepper motor. From this reference voltage, and the resistance of the stepper coils, one can determine the current, which is used to drive the stepper motor.\nFor the stepper driver of the extruder, you could try turning this adjustable potentiometer slightly, in order to provide more current to the stepper, in turn to provide sufficient torque such that the motor is able to turn. Or, less current to stop the stepper from overheating.\nThe adjustments can be made whilst the power is on, but a non-ferrous (i..e. plastic) screw driver should be used, so as to avoid short circuits. Also care needs to be taken, when turning the potentiometer, as they have been known to just fall apart whilst being turned. If you are paranoid, then make micro adjustments with the power turned off, and then turn back on to check the behaviour.\nNote: it should go without saying that one should never disconnect a stepper whilst the power is on, as both the driver and the stepper motor may be irrevocably damaged.\n\nThe photo above is taken from POTs Calibration \u2013 RAMPS 1.4.\n\nIf a POT is set too high then the associated stepper driver will tend to overheat and go into over-temperature thermal shutdown (to prevent damage to its components). The first sign of overheating is erratic stepper motor behavior. Typically, this can be recognized by the sounds of the stepper motor suddenly losing power (thermal shutdown). If no load or movement is required of the motor, it is hard to detect whether it is over-powered as the driver is barely producing any heat.\n\nand\n\nConversely, if the POT is set too low, the stepper motor can enter an underpowered state. This can be recognized by a lack of holding torque and a stepper motor that is skipping steps because the necessary movement  requires a higher power demand than the POT setting allows for.\n\n\nDriver cooling\nIn addition to the possibility of the stepper motor over heating, it could be possible that the stepper driver is overheating, although the symptoms may be different, to those that you are experiencing. Regardless, you may still find it advantageous to cooler the controller/driver board with a fan that is always on (not temperature controlled).\nAdditional reading\n\nRigidWiki - Stepper Driver Adjustment, which goes into further detail about the adjustment of the potentiometers, that I outlined above, as well as the reference voltage and the adjustment thereof.\n\nRepRap Wiki - RepRapPro Setting Motor Currents describes a different controller to yours, but goes into the process of adjustment, and description of the reference voltage (which is applicable to all boards):\n\n\n\nThe wiper on each potentiometer generates a DC voltage that is sent to the chip. This is the reference voltage; it defines how much current the stepping motor driver chip supplies to the motor. The bigger the reference voltage (VREF), the higher the current (A) that the chip will send to the motor. For most NEMA14 motors, the current maximum is 1A, but this will generally cause it to get warm, so a setting of 750mA is recommended. For NEMA17 motors, depending on size, the limit on current is generally between 1.3A and 1.7A. If you drive stepper motors with more current than they were designed for, the motor will get hot, and may be damaged.\n\n\nPololu - A4988 Stepper Motor Driver Carrier with Voltage Regulators - this is a very common stepper driver.\n\nMyHomeFab - DRV8825 Adjust Stepper Current goes into the adjustment of the reference voltage, for the commonly used DRV8825, which is an alternative to the popular A4988.\n\nThis thread, about non-actuating steppers, may also be useful, Motors, which mentions setting the trimpots and points the OP to RepRap Wiki - Pololu stepper driver board, which, in turn, refers to this thread, Strange stepper behavior and this video, video-2012-02-02-16-37-26.mp4, which describes a jitter in the stepper behaviour.\n\n\n", "slicing - Printing objects with holes using M3D Printer": "\nHave you tried letting it print a few more layers?

The distance between the two gear centers, $C$, is given by,\n$$C = \\frac{d_1 + d_2} { 2 }$$\nIf the gears are identical ($d_1 = d_2$), then the pitch diameter is, indeed, the same as the distance between the two gear centers, $C$. Otherwise, is it not.\nAnother method of calculating the gear center distance is,\n$$C = \\frac{N_1 + N_2}{2P_d}$$\nWhere $P_d$ is the diametrical pitch, and $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the number of teeth of the respective gears. From Gear design equations and formula\n\nYou may find the following useful - from Wikipedia - Standard Pitch Diameter:\n\nThe standard reference pitch diameter is the diameter of the standard pitch circle. In spur and helical gears, unless otherwise specified, the standard pitch diameter is related to the number of teeth and the standard transverse pitch. The diameter can be roughly estimated by taking the average of the diameter measuring the tips of the gear teeth and the base of the gear teeth.\nThe pitch diameter is useful in determining the spacing between gear centers because proper spacing of gears implies tangent pitch circles. The pitch diameters of two gears may be used to calculate the gear ratio in the same way the number of teeth is used.\n$$d = \\frac{N}{ P_d } = \\frac {pN}{\\pi}$$\nWhere $N$ is the total number of teeth, $p$ is the circular pitch, and $P_d$ is the diametrical pitch.\n\n", "reprap - MINTEMP error after crash": "\nAfter replacing the control board, it now prints flawlessly.

Each imported object would have to be manipulated individually via the changes in the code. If your imported objects have quantifiable dimensions, that is, if you know specific measurements, you would have an easier time of the project.\nIf you are not limiting yourself to OpenSCAD, I'd recommend the easy-to-use MeshMixer. I recently \"assembled\" the parts of a cosplay \"weapon\" for a friend. All the parts were individual STL files and were positioned in 3-space using MeshMixer to make the parts appear as if the project were printed and assembled.\nThe transform tool in Meshmixer is a graphic three-arrow/three-axis manipulator icon. Grab an arrow tip and the model moves in the direction of the drag. Grab an arc between two arrows and the model rotates. If you want five degree rotation increments, move the mouse outward after the grab and get a calibration circle. When the mouse is on the circle, you get snaps to five degrees. If you need smaller movement, move the mouse out even farther from the center.\nThe 3-space presented in Meshmixer gives you the ability to align pieces/parts in all three dimensions, to your satisfaction. There is a model hide and a model-ghost feature as well, to assist the placement.\nI expect that one could use a program such as Blender, but the learning curve is more like a chasm or cliff-face.\nOne could use an engineering-focus program such as SolidWorks, Fusion 360 and so many others, but I think your head, arms, legs, torso reference means you aren't using orthogonal models more suited to those programs.\nMeshmixer, like OpenSCAD is free. I use both and approve this message.\n", "extrusion - Unidentified problem in printing": "\nOkay so one problem at a time.. You have several issues.\n1 You will likely note while it prints, the pillar will almost catch and sometimes twang as the layers get higher and higher. Issue here is you are over extruding a bit and the head is dragging on the print. Add some leverage and then you get this strange pattern. Letting it cool more between layers or by adding a fan will also help. A small pillar like this will not have much time to cool.\nOr it could be that your Z is not straight. Whats the name of this test? Right the Z resonance test. Check out your smooth rods and screws and see if they are perfect or not.\n2 Hmm maybe some oozing / over extrusion. I mean it will never be perfect.\n3 Looks good to me. You are printing PLA not ABS?. Looking at your temps and I hope you are doing ABS.. Which probably should bridge a bit better. That said even my highly calibrated machines would have a hard time with a bridge like that. I've been at this for years. Fan will help. Different material will help. I mean you are printing over air. That said 1-2 degrees will make a difference. Try slowing it down. Try lowering temp. Add that fan. Remember every spool will need a new perfect temp. Even a different color will need calibration as the pigments change the temperature profile.\nLast over all, simplify 3d seems to really help. I rarely spend time calibrating these days. Albeit they cost a lot. no affiliation.\nI also like this visual guide \nhttp://reprap.org/wiki/Print_Troubleshooting_Pictorial_Guide\nEDIT. I see you have added more photos!\nFor the Z axis, I stick with my first assessment. Over-extrusion. Or it could just be getting too hot the higher you go. Maybe add a min time between layers option if your slicer supports it. Fan is good too. \nXY resonance.. Tricky tricky. My research shows this can be solved by using a different slicer program. You will have to research how to solve this with your preferred program. Maybe try to tighten belts, and tweek your oozebane settings. I would also play with acceleration and Jerk at the Firmware level.. \nLast one, Bridging. You have bigger issues than bridging.

That said...\nFor high detail you want SLA. i.e. jewelry. If you just want a prototype of a mold, you can do a standard FDM style printer (95% of printers are FDM, and that number is a guess)\nReally, you should be asking what material you need for your mold, but you can open a second question for that.\nDo more research on injection molding. There is a great deal of information on how molds are made, i.e. How It's Made Plastic injection molds.\nYou will see there is a vast difference between a plastic, or silicon, mold and an injection molding machine. You are thinking that injection molding as a single mold, when it is really it is a system composing of several pieces of heavy duty machinery that can pump out hundreds of items a day automatically. However, it usually starts at 20k USD for the tooling for injection molding. Your costs could be a fraction of that or could be several times that. This is just a generality.

Measuring the dimensions of a sample print with a set of calipers is a good way of identifying over/under extrusion. \nGeneral maintenance items perhaps?\n\nThermistor: Nozzle temperature measurement is dependent upon the precision of the thermistor and how well it is attached... 5% drift at 220 degrees may be as low as 210 degrees or as high as 230 degrees. Use a thermocouple on a multimeter, non-contact probe, etc. to verify your nozzle temperature.\nTemperature: Nozzle temperature 'sag' of +/- 5 degrees is normal. Monitor nozzle temperature during a print to see if it stays within this range (see: Speed below). \nSpeed: Printing fast is awesome... when you have a hotend that can keep-up with the demands of melting incoming filament. Too fast, and the filament may not be properly melted; increasing the pressure needed to force it through the nozzle. Support material and infill typically print faster than the rest of the model - you mentioned hearing clicks \"...mostly during filling areas.\"\nAlignment: Make sure the hobbed gear, idler bearing, and filament are properly aligned. Filament that wanders around in the feed path is much more likely to slip and/or buckle.\nTeeth: Make sure that the teeth of the hobbed gear are clean and clear of debris. 'Gunk' in hobbed gear teeth reduce grip on the filament.\nTension: Increase the tension between the hobbed gear and idler bearing if possible; worn hobbed gears may need a little extra help holding-on to the filament. \nStepper: Heat generated by the stepper motor can be passed down to the hobbed gear... softening the filament and causing it to slip. Stepper quality, capacity, and duty cycle can greatly effect how much heat is generated; 200+ degrees is entirely possible. Passive cooling (heatsink) is a good idea, active cooling (fan) is better. \n\nA loose heat-break, nicks in the filament path, variations in filament width, etc. are all possibilities as well. \nAlso, Simplify3D created a great reference for solutions to common 3D printing problems (if you haven't seen it already). \nhttps://www.simplify3d.com/support/print-quality-troubleshooting/\n", "Non-Heated Beds affect on 3D Prints": "\nYes.

Once you know you are really into it you can buy a higher end machine, or hunt craigslist / ebay / facebook groups for a used one.\nWhat the heated bed will allow you to do is print more than PLA, and certain formulations of no warp ABS. The Makerbot uses no heated bed, instead in addition to being PLA only it does what we call a raft. That said one of my 6 printers is a makerbot and it still gets warping if the print is on the edge of the plate. \nYou can also add a heated print bed later. If your electronics allow for it.\nThat said.. Just buy one with a heated bed? I know you can get one close to that price point. Heated beds cost 7 dollar. However as pointed out by Tom, there are other costs such as a more powerful heated bed. Still one should be able to get a printer in that price range or close to it with a heated bed.\nTo be more clear. You will not have a 90% fail rate if you use PLA. However your prints will often have some heat warping and you will HAVE to use a raft. \nfrom \nhttp://www.reprap.org/wiki/Glossary\n\nRaft\n  A technique used to prevent warping. Parts are built on top of a 'raft' of disposable material instead of directly on the build surface. The raft is larger than the part and so has more adhesion. Rarely used with heated build surfaces. For the small area models, it is very useful to prevent warping via adding a raft for the model before slicing it. It can also help with with precision parts by removing the slight first few layer distortion caused by the heated bed.\n\n", "hotend - Extending extruder heater and thermistor wires": "\nSoldering is fine, both for the thermistor wires as for the heater.\nThe wires don't need to be particularly special, though there are some things you should keep in mind:\n\nCurrent.

It might be worth exploring these a bet, however probably not what you really need.\nNext the more hard core cad tools such as solid works will allow you to preform Parametric optimizations and Topology Optimization.\nTopology Optimization. seems to be your real winner\n\nNow from the 3d printer standpoint we just simply tweak our slicer settings. There are entries for Infill. I usually print with 7% infill. AKA my print is 93% hollow inside. I then set a few solid shell layers. Think of solid shells as the skin. Usually that is enough to reduce my plastic usage. The only reason I don't make a part 100% hollow and a few solid skin / shell layers is that I need something to print on top of or if I need the part to be strong . Even low percent infill can be very strong if the correct geometric pattern is used (I.E. triangles).\nGenerally the reduced infill will be enough, unless you are making thousands of this item, though in that case you are probably not going to 3d print it anyways.\n\n3dprintingforbeginners has a nice article on the relationship between infill, number of shells and part strength. A bit more information about the terminology (infill/shells/etc...) can be found on 3D printing blog.\n", "3d models - Does XYZPrinting software allow the creation of rafts when printing?": "\nOk. After watching some YouTube Videos, I would take it that the abovementioned software does include the option to create rafts when printing a model.\n", "heated bed - PLA and bed heating?": "\nI actually find it's not needed for PLA. I generally have it heated to 40\u00a0\u00b0C and use blue painters tape along with some hairspray (I prefer Tresemme as it smells gorgeous).\nI've experimented with a glass bed, and Buildtak but I find blue painters tape is the key. I overlap the blue tape ends to the bed so it sticks, then spray the hairspray onto the tape. Also bed leveling is super important as are your print settings. What you want for the first layer is to have it essentially \"pushing\" into the bed. That way it gets good contact and wont curl up during the print, though it can be a challenge to get off later.\nTL;DR for PLA you dont need a heated bed, its more about the surface and 1st layer height.\n", "Is z-axis zero near the hotend?": "\nGenerally, Z-axis zero is when the hot end and the build plate are close to each other.  Some printers keep the hot end up at the top, and bring the build plate up to reach it.  Other printers keep the build plate at the bottom, and lower the hot end down to reach it.  As such, \"Z axis zero\" doesn't specify top or bottom of the physical printer, it just specifies that the hot end is right up against the build plate, ready to print its first layer.  In the printer you describe, where the hot end remains at the top, that's where Z zero is.\nIn terms of the model being printed, Z axis zero is always the bottom of the model, the first layer to be deposited on the build plate.  The numbers increase from there, either lifting the hot end up, or pushing the build plate down, depending on the design of the printer.\n", "pla - First layer overlap on one side": "\nThis may be a result of an unlevel build plate (OP did not specify if calibration was done at time of writing).\nIf the area that is overlapping is higher (closer to the nozzle), the filament will be pushed down and around the nozzle as it extrudes in that area. This will result in excess filament overlapping unto other strands on the layer.\nPlease excuse my lack of artistic skills in paint, but the image below should illustrate what can happen when your build plate is unlevel:\n\nBasically what it's trying to illustrate is that if the nozzle is closer than the expected layer height, the machine will continue to flow as if the nozzle is layer height away. This typically results in a larger layer width because the nozzle is essentially pushing material out of the way.\nYou will notice that as you go further to the right in the drawing, that your layer may begin to \"thin out\" because if the nozzle more than a layer height away, the filament \"stretches\" until it settles on the build plate, resulting in a thinner layer width.\nIdeally, your nozzle will be parallel to your build plate at all points along the build space and the \"Standoff Distance\" will be equal to your layer height. So, you should see the top of your bead of filament at the same height as the bottom of your nozzle.\n", "calibration - Designing/Printing objects with sized holes": "\nThe reason holes come out undersized is generally the slicer, so calibrating the printer itself cannot solve the issue (without making other things worse). The output of the printer is exactly what it should be, given the G-code provided to it. It's just that the G-code does not represent the hole diameter correctly.\nIt would be best to simply account for the deviation in your design, or simply drill out undersized holes to the correct diameter.\n", "services - MakerBot Camera Stream": "\nI own the gen 5, not the gen 5+. As far as I can tell, the camera has not gotten much of an upgrade and the software is also just as limited. That said to be sure I verified on several sites such as this reddit. \nThere are some that claim that the software is open source. I do not think this is true given the parent company. Following even if it was you do not want to use their camera. It is shocking how cheap they went on this ultra premium printer. Which despite printing very well has not been received well. The main issue is that the camera is 320 by 240! That alone is enough to derail your quest I am afraid.\nTake a look at this raspberry pi project on building your own camera set up.

The majority of FDM printers use millimeters so most people export objects with the assumption the values in the STL file are in millimeters.\nAs you found out that's not always true. The second most common assumption is to export in inches.\nMost of the slicers I've used provide a scaling option if you can't edit the STL file yourself. Some will even offer to do the inches to mm conversion for you. Scale to suit when you print or use a 3d editor. I've gotten specific sizes by creating a temporary cube the size I wanted and scaling the object using the cube as a reference.\n", "electronics - Anet board - MOSFET replacement?": "\nThere are two areas of this design which seem to pose a risk of connectors overheating, the hot end and the heated bed. The heated bed runs at about 6 amps, 12 Volts. The hot end runs at a lower current, but can itself overheat if the thermistor stops providing feedback.\nThe problem in this design with the heated bed is mainly the connectors - they work OK when they are good, but can easily come a bit loose. This has two side effects. The bed heats less well, and the connector itself heats instead. Replacing the 2mm plug connector, and 2mm molex with direct soldered connections will help (the on-board mosfet seems OK with the current, unless you increase the power rail voltage).\nA mosfet is a good solution for high current switching, the modules available have good screw terminals which should be OK for maybe 25A (well in excess of what you need). Mosfets are efficient when switched fully on, so there won't be much heating.\nYou would also use a relay (rated for at least 10A), but this will be noisy since the heater is switched repeatedly to maintain the target temperature. A relay also takes more power itself and will ear out if repeatedly switched under load.\nBottom line, if you have a good relay already, it is OK as a temporary (safe) solution. Longer-term a mosfet is better. Pay attention to the connectors at power supply, board (in and out) and heated bed. Using an additional mosfet for the hotend is maybe overkill.\n", "3d models - Photogrammetry using pure rotation?": "\nThis is not a problem specific to Visual SFM, but a general technical problem.

You simply put the printer into Fine mode, and the resulting print will be printed with 100 \u03bcm thick layers.\nIf this is not what you wanted to ask, then please clarify your question.\n", "g code - Calculating the estimated print time of an already sliced file": "\nFirst of all, there are some nice open source analyzers written in JavaScript that you can use online, or read the source to, at https://www.gcodeanalyser.com/ and http://gcode.ws/. Their predictions don't fully match actual printer firmware, but they do a reasonably close job, and reading them would be informative.\nBasically, the story behind acceleration and jerk is that you can't change the velocity (speed or direction) of the print head instantaneously. It takes time to speed up and slow down. Acceleration is the max rate at which the velocity of the print head can change. Jerk is something of a misnomer/hack, and is the max fake-instantaneous change in velocity allowed at the junction of two segments/curves. The point of jerk is to avoid choppy motion when moving along a curve made up of many segments by accelerating/decelerating at each tiny corner. Note that there are two sets of settings for both acceleration and jerk:\n\na maximum absolute value (3D vector length) that frequently changed as part of the gcode in order to use different acceleration profiles for print moves vs travel moves, walls vs infill, etc.\nper-axis absolute values (standard 1D absolute value) for the limitations of the machine, that are usually set in the printer's settings or the start gcode profile for your printer and never changed.\n\nMovement is constrained to always respect both sets of settings.\nPrinter firmware uses acceleration and jerk settings along with lookahead at upcoming motion commands to decide how to actually operate the motors. When it starts a motion, it has to accelerate up to the configured max velocity within the acceleration constraints. It also has to start slowing back down midway through unless it knows the next motion is going to continue in the exact same direction; how much it has to slow down depends on the difference in the vectors of motion. If the next motion is going to be in approximately the same direction, it may be able to avoid slowing down by using the jerk allowance to make an \"instantaneous\" change of velocity at the corner. Only if you have long (relative to speed) linear or approximately linear motions will you ever actually reach the requested speed.\nSo, to estimate print time, you need to model this. Keep track of print head velocity while processing/simulating the gcode, and for each motion command, compute velocity as a function of time using the acceleration limits (accelerating at the max rate they allow). You also need to figure out the final velocity you want to end the motion with in order to be able to start the next motion command, and a point to start decelerating if necessary to reach that.\n", "Troubleshooting filament slip on MakerBot 5": "\nOh interesting. By slips, I take it you mean that the raw filament slips, not the print slips.\nThis will happen for a few reasons. First the tooth gear that grabs the plastic is either:\n\nWorn out\nOut of place\nNot the correct distance from the guide wheel. \n\nThis is all part of the mechanism that the Smart Extruder attaches TO. Not the Smart Extruder itself. You might be able to fix this yourself, worst case you will need a replacement assembly from MakerBot. I would look into online auction sites for the part\nAnother option is to try thicker filament. Which you might be able to custom order. So instead of 1.5, maybe get 1.8. I am not sure where you can buy off sizes.\nFrom there this machine might just be getting jammed. It happens to some machines. This again points to the base of the X axis assembly. \nLast which I would say is not likely as you have tried multiple extruders, you might have the nozzle becoming clogged. I often pop open my extruders voids warranty and clean them out. Also micro hand drills are a good option here. \n", "filament - Change 1.75 mm 3D printer to 3.0 mm printer": "\nFirst it really depends on your printer / extruder. That said generally 1.75\u00a0mm is cheaper and much more common.\nIf one were to change the hotend, likely you will need to replace most or all of the hot end. In the case of my personal hot ends, when I did this conversion I had to replace both the tube and the PETF lined mouth. I did not have to replace the tip, core, or the thermsister.\nMy advice is to pick a different printer. You see 3\u00a0mm on older extruders like J Head direct gear from around 2012-2013 and Bowden style (like the Ultimaker) use 3\u00a0mm (actually 2.85\u00a0mm).\nPossible yes, advised, no.\n", "quality - Producing closely fitting parts": "\nThere are a lot of factors to 3D printing parts that work and fit together. \nA lot of it will be discovered by trial and error, but let's try to put you on the right path. \nFirst your material is what matters the most. Specifically their coefficient of thermal expansion, i.e. how much can the plastic change when heat is applied. PLA's coefficient is low compared to ABS, for example. Which is why the MakerBot can print without a heated bed, but it cannot print ABS with any success.\nHere is a list of coefficient of thermal expansions by material.\nWhat you want to do next is to print out a few test items and see for yourself. Below is an example of reality vs. expectation. As you can see the circle shrinks. It will never expand. So you will always make it bigger than you need. It is also good to note in this example below that the block itself is Larger than expected. The best solution is to not expect high tolerances and build a lot of flex into your designs.\n\nGenerally you want the hole size larger. If I wanted a 4 mm minimum hole, then I would likely make it 5+ mm.\nThe best thing you can do is print out a tray and document how different the sizes are. Also, do the same with a print of various peg sizes. Below is an example of such a tray.\n\n\nAlso, you might want to look into other materials such as Nylon and Carbon fiber.\nA great source of more tips. Here is a great tutorial, Designing Mechanical Parts - The Whoosh Machine by shapeways, on designing parts.\nA RepRap Wiki article on different lubricants in regards to 3D printers.

The extruders main part is the small gear that pushes the filament through the hotend. There could be lots of reasons for it to fail:\n\nThe motor driving it isn't strong enough. Poorly designed printer (yeah, ultimaker, I'm looking at you). Not very likely. But a geared extruder or motor can improve extrusion.\nYou print at to low hotend temp.

Unfortunately, the quality:price ratio is as to be expected here. My reasoning:\nPTFE has great thermal properties for a polymer, just like ABS. In fact, the glass-transition state begins at relatively the same temperature between the two materials. ABS starts transitioning at about 105\u00b0C and about 127\u00b0C for PTFE.\nHowever PTFE, traditionally, has a much higher melting point at about 327\u00b0C as opposed to the usual 125\u00b0 we use in 3D printing.\nMy Point: I think the hardware you currently have has low-quality PTFE.\nPTFE can be recycled for re-use in other PTFE products. In recycled PTFE, you can lose a lot of the desired properties in the material (true for any material). This includes both the ideal \"friction-less\" and thermal resistance we need in 3D Printing.\nWhat I think happened: The higher print temperatures of ABS transitioned the PTFE into its glass-state. As the throat expands, the path of least resistance in the assembly is towards the extruder motor since the nozzle holds more pressure.\nI would not recommend \"fixing\" this problem with a retainer! By forcing the PTFE throat to stay in position, you could potentially force the PTFE to expand in other ways. Most likely resulting in constricting the filament, leading to grinding of filament on the drive gear and clogging of the nozzle. Worst case, you end up with gooey PTFE in your nozzle and/or around your retainer.\n", "3d models - Tool to measure in STL files": "\nI suggest Blender.

If you, say, increase the jerk as an experiment and they get sharper (but you obviously have to deal with potential ringing artifacts) then it's due to that pause and acceleration after a direction change.\nI would try lowering the temperature a bit to slow the flow/oozing of the nozzle and calibrate extrusion - just to keep the settings tight as possible to keep dimensional accuracy, but not under extrude obviously.   \nIf it's where a layer change occurs, tweak and play with retraction settings - such as coasting and extra distance on restart (you can put negative values here). Once those are set, as an advanced tweak, try to max the z speed... Obviously this involves motor current, testing for skipped steps etc... but this would make the layer change a bit quicker, to further reduce oozing, due to the delay in layer changes if retraction settings don't fix it. \nUsually, you can fix the corners with retraction settings but then it can mess up other parts of a model, since those settings are global...

Still, I'd rather go with lower current to limit heating up the motors. I was just wondering if there is something in the two slicing engines that makes cura provoke much harsher movements that cause the printer to lose steps... \u2013 kamuro May 21 '17 at 21:22\n\nMotors are tough\nMotors are meant to be warm, some are made to be hot.  Not all motors have the same specs, but I pulled one on Amazon (link) which shows a rated temperature rise of 60\u00b0C above a rated ambient temperature of 50\u00b0C.  If these specifications stack, and they should because the insulation of the motor is rated to 130\u00b0C, you can boil water on the stepper motors.\nBut ... other factors\nBut, what are the real limits, and how much current should you run through the motors?\nFirst, many 3D printers have plastic mounts for the stepper motors.  You don't want that plastic to soften.  It can if the motors get too hot.  I've seen it in a commercial 2D printer, and gnashing of teeth across the Pacific ensued.  Even for PLA, that temperature is uncomfortable to human flesh.  I soften PLA at 75\u00b0C when fitting tight parts, but PETG and ABS are good for higher temperatures.\nLow current hurts accuracy\nMotors are remarkably linear converters of current to torque, but they still have non-linearities at the limits.  This matters most when micro-stepping, which (AFAIK) all 3D printers use for higher resolution.\nTwo factors hurt accuracy at lower currents when micro-stepping.\nNon-linearities in the drivers result in magnetic fields that do not linearly align with the commanded drive strength.  The torque is not exactly what is needed to position the motor between the poles at the correct angle.\nStatic friction, sometimes called stiction, requires additional torque to overcome.  In a slow micro-stepping move, this will result in the motion hanging back, then jumping ahead.  Motion can be ragged rather than smooth.  Extrusion can be pulsating rather than smooth.\nBoth are improved by applying enough current to the motor to generate enough torque.  More current gives more heat, but also better behavior and performance.\nPower up the motors!\nThey can take it.  Check their mounts to be sure the mounts aren't underdesigned.\nWhy Cura and not Slic3r?\nA deeply detailed review of the g-code would be needed.  It could be as simple as the direction of infill, or the preferred direction of your model compared with the direction chosen by the two slicers.\nIt could be some limits coded into the \"custom g-code\" portion of the two slicers.  I am not familiar with Cura, but Slic3r allows you to insert additional g-code under many situations.  Something brought in with a printer profile may be limiting acceleration of jerk.\nCould be differences in fan setting, or almost anything.\nWhen you are dealing with a marginal situation, and it sounds like this is right on the edge, very small differences can cause dramatic changes in how the whole system responds.  3D printers are complex systems, with resonances, many vibration modes, non-linear friction.  Knowing for sure may be beyond the scope of your and our engineering tools.\nDon't operate on the Margins\nSet the motors to the proper current levels.  Set the bed to the proper height.  Set the hot end to the right temperature.  Try to always stay in the sweet spot.  Your prints will reward you.\n", "slicing - Why does Cura insert G0 commands between G1 commands while Slic3r doesn't?": "\nFormally, G0 is a rapid move and G1 is a coordinated move. A G1 will cause the printhead to move in a straight line from the begin to the end position, whereas a G0 allows the printhead to move in any curve, so long as it ends up in the target position. Because of acceleration and deceleration constraints, it can sometimes be faster to move in a curve rather than a straight line.\nHowever, I don't think any actually firmware implements this, and a G0 behaves in the exact same way as a G1.\nWhat the piece of G-code you posted is doing is creating a solid infill, which consists of a bunch of parallel lines, each slightly offset from the next:\n\nIt makes sense that no material is extruded when it moves from one line to the other, as otherwise too much material would get deposited at the edge.\n", "Display crashed/corrupted on AnyCubic Prusa I3 clone": "\nIssues like this are often caused by the length of the ribbon cable connecting to display to the board, or by its vicinity to other wires.

This includes your filament measurements etc. You should go back 2-3 times between this step and the previous to make sure your extruding EXACTLY what you think you are. As mentioned by others filament calculation is hard. You need to measure across a lot of material. Take the averages. You will never get it perfect as the plastic is never perfect. Picking a solid supplier is a factor here too. \nOnce you think you have that all working. Repeat. Start at step one. \nAfter your done looping though you will start with the slicer calibrations.

The firmware settings like jerk and acceleration will be less of a factor between materials. Get it perfect once and don't touch it (till you decide it is not perfect).\nYou will be testing the new material with the same STLs as I mentioned in the precious section. You also might want to look into Simplify 3d (no affiliation) if you get really into it. Also SAVE THE SETTINGS. Nothing sucks more then losing all this work and having to recreate these profiles for materials. Do not trust slic3r to back them up, or to not randomly delete them. Hard lesson there.\nFar as max speeds and accelleration..\nMax speed will really be a function of how fast can you hear up plastic. If you have a e3d with Volcano mod you can really crank the speed up. So you go to the point where your extruder just cannot hit target temps AND you are unable to print solid infill. Far as acceleration and jerk. When you knock your extruder causing your print to shift, then you know it is accelerating / jerking too hard.\nBest of luck!

It's really all about heat being added to the system at the same rate that it's leaving.  The heat block is there as a heat reservoir from which the filament draws heat for the glass transition.  The heat in that reservoir is maintained by cycling the heating coil to add energy (more heat) to the systems as it's lost.\nIn the very local vicinity of the nozzle, the temperature will decrease slightly as it's being transferred to the filament, but because the heat block is massive in comparison to that drain, and because the heat block is a good thermal conductor that temperature reduction is very small.  \nI do not know what tolerance and hysteresis are built into the temp controller, but think the variation is likely small.  The difference in additional heat required (more energy into the system) for any practical difference in feed rates (40 instead of 60) is thus likely to be very small compared to the filament cooling experienced immediately after it leaves the nozzle.\nBottom line: the adjustment you would want to make is not to increase the temp, but increase the duty cycle of the heating element to maintain the desired temperature.\n", "electronics - Connecting an inductive sensor to the Anet A8": "\nI am not entirely familiar with the ANET A8 electronics, but it's very unlikely it's any different from how any other mainboard works, so any instructions that work for RAMPS should work for your board as well.\nThe sensor you linked to has an operating voltage range of \"6V to 36V\". However, the endstop connectors (on any mainboard I've come across) only provide 5V - not enough for the sensor to work. You could verify that this is also the case for your ANET board with a multimeter.\n(Assuming the colour coding is standard) you'll need to connect the black wire to GND, the red wire to 12V, and the yellow wire through a diode to the signal pin of the endstop connector. The anode of the diode should connect to the signal pin and the cathode to the wire coming from the sensor.\nThe diode is required, because otherwise the 12V signal from the sensor will damage your electronics, which can only accept 5V. Any ordinary diode will do (for instance 1N4148). You should enable endstop pullups in your firmware when using this method (though if your board already has physical pullups this is not necessary but won't hurt either).\nNote that if the sensor is inductive, it will also need an appropriate (metal) surface to trigger off. Unfortunately, it is not clear from the product description what type of sensor you have bought, and (amusingly) gearbest doesn't know either:\n\nQuestion:\nHello, is this Sensor capazitiv or induktiv?

However I would like to mention that chances are that the random spool you pickup from most stores, especially no name brands, are either completely lying to you about its material or is mixed / cut with cheaper fillers. All about finding a good brand. Course rarely does one actually need pure PLA, a mixed material will often perform as well without you even noticing. Aside from the temp difference. Not to say it is right.\nNow the trick is this. While I don't advise ever breathing in potentially carcinogenic plastic smoke. You take a lighter. Burn it. If it smells sweet it is PLA. \nFrom this link from digital trends about PLA VS ABS you can see why it has this smell.\n\nThe thermoplastic is also more pleasant on the nose, as the sugar-based material smells slightly sweet when heated opposed to the harsh smell often associated with ABS. However, while PLA might seem like a better overall choice at first glance, it features a far lower melting point than ABS.\n\nAlso not responsible if you burn yourself or your property. At your own risk. \nJust warming it with lighter might work too. But just burning a small section. It will be real clear. \nOr you could just drop a bit into aceton and see if it melts. PLA will mostly just look like crud after being treated is aceton. ABS is 100% dissolve. \nWe see from these forums that PETG does not dissolve via Aceton. So you can test you material. If it does disolve it is ABS. If it smells sweet when burned it is PLA. If it melts at 240 and does not dissolve it is likely PETG.\n\nSolid forums\n3d printboard\n\nWe are a bit lost on a test for PETG. However we do know its melting point. Which is 240-260c. I would say it is likely you have ABS\n\nOnce we know the material we can get to the meat of your question. \nBest way to proceed is to start with simple calibration prints. The thin wall. Cube, and part fitting. Once those pass you are good to go. Other than buying simplify3d I do not know of any short cuts. Back when I used slic3r I kept a spread sheet. I would change a temp by 5 degrees and give it a quality score. Repeat with speeds. Far as fan, I would expect that it wont effect much. Maybe need to calibrate your PIDs.\nOnce you have it dialed in, all you will need to do is calibrate the temp when switching materials. Remember you need to calibrate even between different colors (okay its best to.. I often skip) I usually do the temp adjustments live on the printer. Increase and degrease a few degrees. For me the goal is to have the plastic as cool as possible. That allows for highest quality prints (ie less oozing and such)\n", "prusa i3 - 3d prints come up with ribbing on one side": "\nHmmmm In my experience when a printer has that bad of wobble it is still the Z axis. Your rods might be good, but are the two Z axis the exact correct distance and equal distance on the printer frame? Imagine that you had one a few millimeters too far out. How might the rods act? Mayhaps, over the course of several layers, they would slowly drift back and forth? Creating a period effect on your print? What do the top of the rods do over time? Do they move a lot if you go from height 0 to 100mm on z?\nI have a few ideas. What happens if you loosen you Z motors so they can move around their mount? I had to do that on my Prusa back in the day. I think for that machine the Belt was actually too tight causing the issue. Current printers are usually better designed so its unlikely that is your issue. Also measure the distance between the top of the rods when the carriage is at 0, and at max. You should see very little variance.\nIf it was on both sides I would say it was bad PID calibration. IE this simplify 3d link\nThough you can see on this forum the fellow had a bad coupler.

Cold air cools the fan\ncold air is denser so fan can suck more cold air than hot air so cooling is more efficient (fig A)\nin terms of plug of radiator (with dust) it's much better to try to push cold air into plugged fan (fig C) than to suck the air from it (fig B). When flow is decreased there is higher possibility to damage the fan as it doesn't cool itself\n\nOf course we are talking about 3D printers with small plastic fans. Please notice (almost) all fans construction: they are designed to get air from the top of the fan and push it to the bottom (this construction prevents damaging/plugging fan motor by dust)... and their mounting wholes (or clips) are usually... naturally suggesting to direct air to the heatsink)\n\n", "extruder - Silver Solder specifications for hot end heating element": "\nThe first is not suitable.

It seemed to come down to getting the basics of bed adhesion: Heat bed, ABS temp, bed composition, and a \"primer\" layer.  I found the FF Creator Pro to work well with a bed at 110, filament at 230, printing on a glass plate with ABS slurry.  Then adding the brim 6 orbits wide held it down very well.  I found that printing on the stock FF blue plastic was inconsistent with adhesion.  Also, keep the door closed while printing and for something this size don't run the cooling fan (if you're printing on the left nozzle).\nAnd, of course, the right infill helps with the thermal contraction and strength.  I found through testing that the rectilinear patter in S3D gave the best structural support in multiple dimensions.  I also end up typically printing infill at about 15% to ensure a good surface on the upper face.  Any lower and I found a lot of sagging in the top finish.\nIf you're using this as a platform, then the layer size matters a lot also.  You don't need .10mm layers, as .25mm or .20mm layers would probably work better.  Then make sure you print enough top layers to get a good finish.  At .20mm I usually print 4 top layers with a 15% infill.\n", "firmware - Marlin, end stops, and position report": "\nSome info on the subject: few stepper motors have any way of knowing their exact position during operation, which means Marlin will have to assume the steppers always are in the right place. \nIn other words, all g-code commands are executed relative to their current position, not with regards to the real positions. So if you forcefully move the printhead during print, the printer will just continue printing the same patterns in mid-air (this is basically what is called layer shifting).\nThe only way the printer can know the real position of the steppers is when the endpoint switches are triggered. This is why the homing action is done to before prints in order to reset the internal positional bookkeeping of the steppers in Marlin. So if the endpoints are triggered without the printer actually being at the endstops, you will seriously confuse Marlin.\nI agree that is sounds weird that Marlin does not reset the positions of it's steppers when an endstop is triggered (during print?), but then again, if it happens accidentally (and not as part of a re-calibration procedure), I believe the default actions should be to abort all operation since this would indicate the printer being out of control.

What resolution are you seeking? Layer thickness of 0.100 mm is quite good, allowing for ten layers per mm of part thickness, with infill adjusted as required.\nIf you've already determined that your printer will not print at the resolution required for your gear design, you would perhaps purchase a higher resolution printer. Of course, that may be an expense you would like to avoid.\nIf your parts count is small, you could consider to print samples of the parts to confirm fit, but not worry about strength and then use an online service to have them printed via SLS method.\nSelective Laser Sintering places nylon powder on the work surface, then selectively melts the powder into a solid. Each layer when completed is covered with another layer of powder and fused to the previous portion (or not) until the part is complete. \nBecause the un-fused powder provides support, there is no requirement for the model to have supplemental support structures. There is a requirement/objective that the part have \"drain holes\" in areas which might otherwise be solid. Any surface that entraps powder is charged to the purchaser as if the space within is included in the part.\nAn example would be a cube that can be printed as six square faces only. The cube wall thickness can be specified and if a drain hole is incorporated, the cost would be the volume of the walls only. No drain hole would mean the cube would be charged for the entire volume.\nFor gears, which are typically low profile/flat items, that's a minor consideration.\nThe same concept applies to SLA printing, which uses a laser in a vat of resin. If the model is a solid with no drain holes, the interior will retain the resin. It is possible that the interior can be cured with strong UV light and/or sunlight, but opaque resins would not accept this work-around, nor would it reduce the cost involved. Also note that SLA printed items would lack the necessary strength.\nIf farming out your parts is the direction you intend to travel, ensure the dimension stability reference in the vendor you use. Nylon sintered parts will shrink a known amount during the fusing process. The vendor should provide the appropriate reference, or the vendor should confirm that he adjusts the model appropriately for shrinkage.\nI have one very tiny part constructed from SLS nylon and it's amazingly strong for such a thin wall. Nylon wears well too.\n", "bowden - How to straighten PTFE tubes?": "\nI just plugged the ends of tube and soaked it in real warm water for 5 minutes then stretched it out on a table.

As warned the ramps did not like this and smoke began to rise from the board. I am pretty sure I saw smoke only coming from the two ptc fuses (big flat yellow ones).\n\nReplacing poly fuses\nNote: Older RAMPS 1.4 have easily replaceable large poly fuses, whereas the RAMPS 1.5/1.6 use SMD poly fuses, see 0scar's answer to RAMPS 1.4, 1.5 or 1.6?\n\nArduino\nAccording to this user, the MOSFETs and the Arduino Mega's regulator can be fried as well:\n\nit most likely fried the mosfets next to the fuses and probably the voltage regulator on your arduino.\n\nHowever, the fried regulator would only affect the Arduino's operation if powered through the power socket, or VIN (which the RAMPS board uses to power the Arduino Mega). However, via the USB it should still work. See this post, on the same thread:\n\nThe voltage regulator is only needed if you supply power to the arduino via the Vin pin or with a separate power adapter. The RAMPS board does supply the Vin pin with 12V.\n\nSo, you would probably have to rely on powering the Arduino via the USB and not the RAMPS\nRegarding the Arduino, on Arduino.SE there are a number of users who have fried their Arduino in this manner, and many of them suffer slightly different failures, although most are centered around the regulator. One case I remember was that of a capacitor burnout, see Is my Arduino dead? - although the use case was different. There are many other cases on the Arduino.SE.\n\nProtection Diode\nAccording to this post on RepRap - Reverse Polarity, there should be a reverse polarity protection diode (although it appears not to have work in the above example):\n\nIf it was a ramps, those have a reverse protection diode across the input that normally needs replaced after such an incident\n\n\nStepper drivers/motors\nThe stepper motors themselves should survive, as should the stepper drivers.\nHowever, each case can be different and it would depend upon the quality of the board (is it a cheap clone or branded?), and the quality/tolerance of the components used - these factors would determine where in the chain of modules the failure occurs. Obviously, the earlier the failure's location in the chain the better.\n\nMKS Base v1.2\nAs an aside, this user fried their regulator (the fuses were fine) on a MKS Base v1.2 (not RAMPS), by reversing the polarity, which caused the stepper drivers to fail. However, replacing the regulator fixed it, see this post:\n\nReplacing the regulator chip did fix the board.\n\nRather helpfully the self same user has posted an Instructables of the repair: MKS Base reverse polarity repair.\n\nRAMPSXB\nThere is no protection diode on the RAMPXB. From RAMPSXB:\n\nDo NOT reverse polarity on the input pins, as there is NO PROTECTION DIODE. Reversing polarity will not only fry your steppers and FETs, but may even damage your Arduino and possibly even your computer. Triple check to make sure the polarity on your power input is 100% correct!\n\n\nSee also\n\nArduino Forum: Checking the RAMPS 1.4 for some handy troubleshooting tips for the Arduino and the Stepper.\n\nThis user on post #5 of Arduino Forum: Checking the RAMPS 1.4 did manage to fry their stepper drivers, but not due to reverse polarity, by from a loose wire:\n\nI didnt connect the power backwards, but either I had a defective Mega2560 clone, or some stray bit of wire somehow shorted something out, and the Mega2560 literally went up in smoke (almost caught on fire !)\nEvery stepper driver was destroyed, but the power FET's and other components survived\n\n", "Bad PEI plate adhesion to heated bed": "\nPerhaps this is due to the aluminum build plate warping/crowning as it heats?  I use a PEI print surface on my Monoprice Maker Select (Wanhao Di3), which has an 8.5\"x8.5\" build plate, and I've had no issues with the PEI coming unstuck.  However, instead of attaching mine directly to the aluminum heated build plate, I attached it (using 3M 468) to a piece of Borosilicate glass, which is then attached to my aluminum build plate using silicone thermal heatsink pads.  The rational for using a Borosilicate glass print surface is that a heated metal build surface is going to warp or move some, as the heat is coming from one side; the glass will not warp and so you have a completely flat surface on which to print (and the heatsink pads help make up the difference in surface geometry).  I used this 3dprinterwiki article as the basis for my glass bed mod, and applied the PEI/adhesive using another source (which I've forgotten, possibly the RepRap wiki).  While the first link is Wanhao Di3 specific, it covers the idea.  Make sure you tweak your z-endstops if needed on your particular machine, as adding the glass plat raises the bed height by several mm.\nPlease note that I'm theorizing - I did not ever try applying my PEI directly to my aluminum build plate, so I have no direct comparison.  But the use of glass to eliminate build plate warping/crowning is fairly well documented.

Which is probably what I would do. \nAs far as shell thickness goes - 2.5 mm is pretty heavy duty. You also need to bear in mind that it's best to have a thickness as a factor of the thickness of your bead or your layer height (depends on printing orientation) - assuming you are going to print this yourself. So usually that would either be divisible by the bead width or by the layer height. If you want translucent - easy enough use translucent or clear filament. I'd probably go for 1.2 mm or 1.6 mm wall thickness.  \nI made an angel at Christmas with clear PLA and quite a thick wall (wasn't my model and I didn't bother measuring - but at least 2 mm) and an LED candle lit it up really well. \nIt's much easier doing this kind of thing after buying the printer. that way you learn much quicker what works and what doesn't.  \n", "filament - Prusa i3 Stopping midprint": "\nThere's really no telling why that happened if you weren't there to observe it.\nA possibility is a temporary power outage, which would stop and reset the printer without any trace of it having happened.

Also, I've been doing a lot of tuning lately, including this z-brace mod which has improved my overall print quality, so I thought I'd take a pass at printing the Knight from your photos and sharing my findings.\nFirst, I've posted a series of pictures to show my findings.  Overall, I'd say my print quality was better than what you showed in your photos, but still isn't good enough.  I sliced with Cura 15.04.6, and printed from SD card.  Here are my (Full) settings:\nLayer height (mm)         : 0.1\nShell thickness (mm)      : 0.5\nEnable retraction         : Yes\nBottom/Top thickness (mm) : 0.3\nFill Density (%)          : 20\nPrint Speed (mm/s)        : 20\nPrinting Temperature (C)  : 210\nBed Temperature (C)       : 67\nSupport Type              : Everywhere\nPlatform Adhesion         : None\nSkirts                    : 3\nFilament Diameter (mm)    : 1.75\nFilament Flow (%)         : 100.0\nNozzle size (mm)          : 0.5\n\nRetract Speed (mm/s)      : 40.0\nRetract Distance (mm)     : 7\nInitial Layer Thick (mm)  : 0.2\nInitial Later width (%)   : 100\nCut off object bottom (mm): 0.0\nTravel Speed (mm/s)       : 100\nBottom Layer Speed (mm/s) : 20\nInfill speed (mm/s)       : 50\nTop/bottom speed (mm/s)   : 20\nOuter Shell speed (mm/s)  : 20\nInner Shell speed (mm/s)  : 20\nMin. Layer Time (sec)     : 10\nEnable cooling fan        : Yes\n\nI do most of my printing with a later height of 0.2mm, but for a detailed mini, 0.1mm is probably the largest that will look good (and probably the smallest possible on this printer.  I normally set most of my speeds to 50 mm/s, with first layer at 20 mm/s; for this I slowed it all to 20 mm/s due to the fine details, and I think it helped.\nTemps of 67\u02daC bed and 210\u02daC extruder are what I've found to work best on my machine for PLA, after much experimentation, but your machine may vary; I'm not sure how accurate the temperature measurements are on these machines.  67\u02daC gives me an observed bed temp of 60\u02daC, but that's at the top surface - I have PEI atop Borosilicate glass, adhered to the bare aluminum bed with silicone-based heat transfer pad.\nI think I miscalculated the top/bottom heights and infill.  I'm not used to printing at 0.1mm layer height, but 3 top layers over 20% infill is clearly not enough - see the closeup of the mini's base in my linked gallery.  Next print, I'll either try 0.6mm top/bottom, or much higher infill.\nThe supports came off easily; I used a pair of sidecutters from my electronics bench.  A little more cleanup with a sharp hobby knife, combined with a better base top layer would probably produce an acceptable result.\nThere were two major flaws.  The first are the little blobs on many layers; see for example the inseam area on the picture of the knight's back.  Ed Nisley at Softsolder.com calls these \"Reveral Zits\", and I think the name is apt.  These happen when the print head needs to quickly reverse direction or stop-move-print, but filament continues to extrude.  I use fairly aggressive retraction settings, and I think my print shows smaller zits than yours, but still far too many.  Ed has explored this topic in some depth; it's possible my extruder stepper isn't keeping up with my settings due to mechanical limits.  This is an area I want to pursue, but I don't have time at the moment.  I plan to read Ed's work and try some experiments on my machine to see if I can get better results; I will update this answer if/when I do.  As it stands, most of them are quite small, and could probably be cleaned up with a knife; the worst are those around unsupported areas, such as the back of the shoulder guard.\nThe second major flaw is the helmet.  It's just... bad.  I'm not sure the printer has much hope of nailing those horns, but overall the head is just bad.  I'm not sure what can be done there.\nTo summarize:  @disc0ninja's advice on Bed Level and Print speed are certainly the right place to start; You might want to try my Cura settings to see if you get similar results.  Also, the Z-brace mod I linked to above has made a big difference for me; I rarely have to adjust my leveling anymore.  I also plan to try slicing with Slic3r, which I haven't used previously, but have been looking into.  You mentioned you couldn't print with Slic3r, was that USB or SD Card?  I'd suggest trying via SD if it failed during USB printing.\nUpdate 30 Jan 2017:  It took a little doing, but I managed to slice and print this model via slic3r.  I had some issues with the original STL in slic3er, which I ended up fixing with a free trial at makeprintable.com.  I spent a lot of time fiddling with slic3r; it has a lot more knobs to turn than Cura, and I make no claims of having the best settings for this print.  There are so many settings that rather than transcribe them here, I've captured them in my pictures of the slic3er print.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, I feel like the quality is higher.  The \"reversal zits\" are hardly noticeable; but the big remaining problem is one I didn't fully diagnose in the original Cura print - lack of support for areas such as the shoulders.  Slic3r added more support than Cura, but it's also harder to separate from the base.  The head isn't great, but much better than the Cura print; I don't think my photos show it as well as it looks.  This print has convinced me that there's plenty of quality still to be wrung from this printer; I hope to make time to do some more slic3r prints of this model while tweaking the params to see what's possible.  If I make any big leaps in quality I will update this answer.\n", "How important is the dimensional accuracy of filament relative to the detail of a print?": "\nDimensional accuracy is not as important as dimensional uniformity. I can print with undersized (or oversized) filament, adjusting the flow appropriately, provided the filament has a consistent diameter. When creating filament in-house, without expensive equipment, it is difficult to maintain the same diameter throughout the entire extrusion. It is likely this extrusion diameter (when creating filament, rather than the output of the actual print head) to which Barafu is referring when he mentions his tolerances: +/- 0.05\u00a0mm in diameter. Which is reasonable.\nThe \"miniature printing\" comment likely refers to printing miniature models for tabletop gaming.\nIf the source filament becomes wider than expected, the output will have overflow, or more material than desired will be deposited, and this will certainly affect the quality of the piece.\n", "print quality - What is the best material for printing an anatomic bone model?": "\nThe Stack Exchange discourages \"best\" type questions, as any answers are going to be opinion based.

A 192W heated bed would need 16A at 12V, but only 8A at 24V.\nSince one of the most common safety issues is underrated screw terminals being used for the heated bed (just search for \"3d printer fire\"; you'll find quite a few pictures of charred plastic around screw terminals). For example, the screw terminals on RAMPs board are only rated for up to 12A. That would be okay at 24V, but well over the limit at 12V.\nSince the wire gauge is dependent on current, you can also use somewhat thinner wires with a 24V system (or equivalently: wires that would melt in a 12V setup won't in a 24V setup). The power dissipated in a wire scales quadratically with current, so the same wire being used in a 24V setup would only waste a quarter of the heat of that wire in a 12V setup. There is also less strain on switching devices (such as MOSFETs or relays). The same applies here: power loss is quadratic with current.\n", "makerbot - Bed design for magnetic easy release when printing PLA": "\nFollow up:\nI used the 6mil magnet, cut a sheet of thin steel, (about .5mm) to fit, added a layer of Buildtak and now it's much easier to remove prints, build surface is very flat. I assume you could deform the metal beyond the magnet's ability to flatten it but it works quite well. The metal was cut with sheet metal snips, risky as they can bend the sheet. Probably better done with a saw though.\n", "Stppr Motor for Prusa i3 - 3D Printing Stack Exchang": "\nAwful answer, I know, but it depends... on where you are going to employ them:\n\nare they are all, or just some, of the axes, or;\njust for the extruder?\n\nIf they are for use in translating movement of the axes, then the weights of:\n\nthe y-axis plate;\nthe x-axis carriage, and;\nthe print head,\n\nwill all come into play - amongst many other things.\nWith a torque of just 32 N \u2022 cm1, they seem, at first glance, to be a little underpowered - a torque of 44 N \u2022 cm (4.5 kg\u00b7cm) is the recommended minimum. Also, the current, of 1.2 A, seems to be a tad on the low side, 1.5 - 1.8 A is recommended.\nThere are some great resources on the RepRapWiki. See:\n\nNEMA 17 stepper motor, and;\nStepper motor\n\nThe minimum (recommended) specifications, for a Nema 17 stepper motor, are:\n\n\n1.5 A to 1.8 A current per phase\n1 to 4 V\n3 to 8 mH inductance per phase\n44 N\u00b7cm (62 oz\u00b7in, 4.5 kg\u00b7cm) or more holding torque\n1.8\u00b0 or 0.9\u00b0 per step (200/400 steps/rev respectively)\n\n\nYou may be able to get yours to work, but is it worth the hassle, just to save a few quid? Best to get the recommended, and most popular steppers, which are:\n\nKysan 1124090/42BYGH4803;\nRattm 17HS8401, and;\nWantai 42BYGHW609\n\nObviously, you don't have to use one of these three motors - other stepper motors can be used. On the Nema 17 Stepper motor link, above, there is a table of a number of stepper motors, of various makes and models, that have been proven to work.\n\nFurther Reading\nMotors, a thread on the RepRap forums - specifically for the Prusa Mendel v2, so not entirely related to the i3, as the steppers for the z-axis are less than those for the x and y axes, but it is a good informative read nevertheless.\n\n1 I assume that you actually mean either 32 N \u2022 cm, or 3.2 kg \u2022 cm.\n", "3d models - How to make a steel mold from a 3D print in high detailed resin?": "\nUnless you have proven demand, you should start with aluminum tooling. It's much cheaper than steel, and (I'm assuming you want this for injection molding) you can produce quite a decent amount of parts from aluminum tooling if you handle it carefully.\nWhy do you want your tooling to be based on a 3D print model? Typically, for greatest accuracy, the tool and die company works from your original CAD work that you printed the 3D model from.\nIn terms of companies, Protolabs does plastic injection molding: https://www.protolabs.com/injection-molding/plastic-injection-molding/\n", "How come firmware isn't uploaded?": "\nAre you sure that the firmware is not being uploaded?\nYou can debug this changing the STRING_VERSION on Configurations.h.\nIf the version is not being changed, I would suggest trying to use another computer to upload the firmware or even another board.\n", "Is PLA filamnt conductiv? - 3D Printing Stack Exchang": "\nNormal PLA is non-conductive. You can take an $\\Omega$-meter to a test part if you're really concerned somehow you have some PLA that is conductive.\nThere is a caveat that your color may include metal flake or graphite of some kind. Depending on the density it may be conductive. But I've tested my silver on hand and it gave me infinite resistance.\n", "filament - FDM: Clear=transparent part": "\nFirst I would hedge your expectations.. I am very familiar with t-glase. It is very translucent but it is not clear and no amount of post treatment will make it 100% clear. Their example is the only exception where you have a simple print where it has only a single layer. By applying the clear coating they have normalized the wall and made the surface even. Thus no more light diffusion. \nYou could likely get the same effect with good sanding but good luck sanding a 1 wall thick print. Also note they do not show any solid parts. If they cannot get a solid part to look good and clear, then really you shouldn't expect to be able to. \nAny infill will cause it to be non clear. Any extra shells will also create air pockets, lines, etc and make it non clear. If you really want clear, FDM is not the way to go. The only way I could imagine to print an item clear with FDM is to create a cast, then cast it with resin or glass.. \nIf you consider how the plastic is applied, you can see there is no real way make it 100% air pocket free.. See below,\n\nImage taken from here. \nThe best I can recommend for settings. Make your temp spot on. If you boil the material you will have less translucency. Play with over extruding (too much material) in a Limited amount. Might reduce gaps. I would also try to print in BIG THICK lines. Less lines, less diffusions.\n", "Is it possible to 3D print a front bumper grille for a Honda Accord CL7?": "\nYour best bet for the material would be one of the high temperature filaments like the ColorFabb HT ones, they can take quite a punch when it comes to heat.\nAs for the model, you could try to source one of the grills that is at least as good in shape as possible and get it scanned, there are people offering this as a service for example over at 3dhubs.com\nGlue is really depending on the part, I would suggest creating a click-together type of system so the \"glue\" is only stabilizing it and not beeing a structural component. You can also get hold of a 3D Pen and weld the parts together with the same material used to print.\n", "extruder - 3D printer extruding too thick": "\nWhen you have a disaster print like this you almost always get carbon in the hot end. I have micro hand drills (0.2 mm) that I carefully use on the tip of the nozzle. There are also atomic pulls where you add plastic, heat it up till it extrudes then let it cool. Once cooled to 70\u00b0C pull hard. Repeat until pulls show no black. Or, if your nozzles are cheap just replace them. \nNote next time this happens, turn the hot end on so you can remove it quickly. Sounds like you chipped away. \n", "pla - Will my Duplicator i3 be able to print this hole in the vertical wall without infill?": "\nThe answer is yes. However I notice that some knowledge is missing due your comments. \nThe walls of the part is formed by 1 or several lines, this lines are called shell.\nThe Infill is the part that fills all within the walls or shell; you can set the infill by 5% to 100% depending in how strong you need the printed part or set 0 to get an empty shell.\nThe printer can be able to print any part, but some areas will need supports, this suports is a kind of outerfill to support areas that could overhang basically walls with 45 degrees or less, this support can be easily removed from the final part \n", "extruder - How to Make Use of 3 mm Filaments?": "\nThis is not a definitive answer (and has turned into a ramble), as I have not yet had to change my filament size. \nHowever, initially, I would have thought that only the hotend and the hotend's nozzle would need to be changed, from one that can handle the 1.75 mm filament to 3 mm. If the extruder is spring loaded, then it should adjust itself to the thicker filament, without a problem. If not, then you may have to do a slight manual adjustment.\nHowever, after doing some further reading, there may be other factors that need to be considered, such as:\n\nExtruder gearing;\nMelt time (which would imply a different feed rate)\n\nIt could be worth having a close look at the aperture of your hotend. If, in the unlikely situation, it looks as if the hotend would accept 3 mm (or if you could remove the lining so that it can), you may not need to actually change any hardware, but instead just try tweeking the feedrate in the software, because as your nozzle is less than the width of the filament anyway, then it will be fine for both 1.75 mm and 3 mm. A 3 mm filament would require more heating, and therefore a slower feedrate than a 1.75 mm feedrate. Once the filament has melted, so long as the pressure from the extruder is sufficient, then the molten filament should come out of the nozzle. However, this may be a less than satisafctory method and result in some dubious prints.\nThere is an interesting thread on the RepRap wiki, 1.75mm Filament vs 3mm Filament, that discusses most of the points above.\nIt should be noted that the advantages of 3 mm filament has over 1.75 mm are that it is:\n\ncheaper\nstiffer (less flexible) and thus \"easier\" to push through the hotend.\n\nAs an aside, one interesting point raised in the thread, is that maybe a smaller extruder can be used, for the narrower 1.75 mm filament, thus resulting in a lighter print head. I am not sure how true that is.\nThis article, Converting a 3D printer from 3mm to 1.75mm, does the reverse of what you want, and comes with a video. It states that, as you have already found, that the hotend needs to be changed:\n\nThe printer [Thomas] is changing out to accept 1.75mm is the Lulzbot\n  Mini, one of the most popular printers that would ever need this\n  modification. The only required materials is a new hot end suitable\n  for 1.75mm filament, a 4mm drill, and a few wrenches and allen keys.\n  It would be a smart idea to get a hot end that uses the same\n  thermistor as the old one, but that\u2019s not a deal-breaker as the\n  problem can be fixed in the firmware.\n\nAlternatively, you could leave your printer as it is and use a 3mm to 1.75mm filament converter, which may be a bit of overkill for just one reel of filament1.\nThe bottomline\nTo be honest, is it worth the hassle, time and expense of having to modify and re-calibrate your printer (or worst case, change the model of the printer), just for the price of a reel of filament (assuming that you did not bulk purchase a bunch of reels)? It may be better to stick to one filament size (i.e. your original size) for all of your projects, and so resell the reel of 3 mm and stick with the 1.75 mm printer and buy the correct filament2.\n\n1 See also Conversion of 3mm ABS filament to 1.75mm\n2 See also Tom's answer to Conversion of 3mm ABS filament to 1.75mm\nSee also Can 1.75mm filament be used in a printer that takes 3mm filament?\n"}
