{"dentistry - What are these lines in teeth?": "\nI believe that those lines are craze lines. \"Craze lines are merely cracks in the enamel that do not extend into the dentin.\" They occur because of stress in your teeth, ie: grinding your teeth, biting your nails, and even routine use of your teeth. What you've said also matches up with craze lines in that you don't experience any pain. Those craze lines aren't nearly as bad as some other teeth. Craze lines rarely lead to tooth breakdown, so you almost definitely won't have to get them replaced. There are some studies that say that craze lines may be spots where cavities can form, but these potential problems can be easily detected by dentists.\nMost craze lines, like the ones below, are much worse than yours.\n\n\nCraze Lines: Hairline Cracks In Your Front Teeth\n\n", "nutrition - Calcium supplements versus \"fortified with calcium\"": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to improve this post?

Human cells largely exhibit a phenomenon called senescence - they just give up and die after they reach a certain age via a biochemical mechanism called apoptosis. The outer limit of survivability for human cells is generally understood to be in the 100-120 year range. One of the things that makes a cancer cell cancerous is the deactivation of the signals for apoptosis, making the cell effectively immortal.\nAt the same time, most illnesses, particularly the \"lifestyle illnesses\" (diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia) so common today, do induce some changes which shorten lifespan.\nThe most significant changes which extended human life were the development of (a) sanitation and (b) antibiotics. These together dramatically reduced death by infectious disease. Removal of early death from infection exposed these diseases of late-life and lifestyle.\n", "drug metabolism - Can the immune system break down anything?": "\nActually, in the case of most drugs, it has nothing to do with the immune system per se. Generally, drugs are either chemically modified (often in the liver) to make them inert, or excreted (either in the urine or the stool) thus removing them from the body. When the liver or the kidneys are not working properly, drugs fail to be excreted or digested, resulting in accumulation, which may be toxic.\n", "wound - What should I consider when deciding to remove a blister or not?": "\nIn the blister shown, the likelihood of rupture is decreased because of the thickness of the epidermis on the palm of the hand, so you can leave it alone until the underlying area re-epithelializes. You'll know this is happening because of the decreased pain and the slow reabsorption of the fluid. Eventually you will just peal it off what's left of the blister, finding clean new skin underneath.\nBut this is a great starting point for an answer about the treatment of blisters in general: is it better to leave them alone, drain the fluid, or de-roof them (take the top of the blister off)?\nThere is a lot of disagreement about what constitutes the optimal treatment of blisters. Some background might be in order.\n\nBlisters form when the upper layers of the epidermis separate from the lower layers, usually at the level of the stratum spinosum. At that level, the cells (because of proximity to the dermis, which contains the capillaries) have moisture in and between them. When the separation occurs, sterile fluid from the stratum spinosum oozes unopposed into the space between the layers, and a blister forms.\nThe fluid, similar to plasma, contains molecules which may promote the rapid division which takes place in the stratum basale.  This then differentiates into the upper layers of the epidermis and healing by new skin formation.\n\nHydrostatic pressure causes the area of the separation to fill with a fluid that is similar in composition to plasma but has a lower protein level. About 6 hours after formation of the blister, cells in the blister base begin to take amino acids and nucleosides; at 24 hours, there is high mitotic activity in the basal cells; at 48 and 120 hours, new stratum granulosum and stratum corneum, respectively, can be seen.\n\nThe sterile fluid is a very rich and inviting growth medium for bacteria. For this reason, some people think it should be removed. The denuded skin underneath has lost some of it's protection against infection. For this reason, some think the blister should be left intact. Between these two extremes are those who favor drainage of the fluid leaving the cover intact.\nTo my thinking (and training), this is the worst option. Poking a hole in the blister, no matter how cleanly it's done, will leave a point of entry for bacteria (it doesn't take much). The bacteria will flourish in the moisture (which will still seep into the space) under the roof of the blister, protected from being washed away. This may (and often does) lead to an infection of the wound.\nIt's much better to prevent infection than to treat it. \nThe reasoning of either of the other camps is more supportable. I favor leaving the blister intact as long as possible, giving the underlying wound time to form new stratified protective epidermalis.\nTreatment by people in this camp consists of carefully cleaning and disinfecting the surface of the blister and the surrounding skin, and covering it loosely with protective padding, usually gauze, then wrapping the entire thing with gauze wrap. The patient is instructed to check the blister daily; if it \"pops\" or becomes cloudy, the roof must be removed (most people prefer to have this done by a doctor or nurse), the area cleaned to remove any bacteria which might have entered, and a sterile dressing (over a light application of an antibacterial cream) reapplied, and changes daily until healed.\nThe opposite camp reasons that the blister will break anyway, so get it over with and get the sterile dressing on, then clean and redress (with a light application of an antibacterial cream) daily. Also, if the blister is tense, it may be impeding healing of the base by decreasing blood flow. The problem with this approach is that it hurts more than leaving it alone, and the risk of infection is still greater than if the blister is intact.\nMany studies have been done to try to determine the best approach. Common sense plays a role. If the blister is very delicate (as in a large, tense and fragile blister of a burn), or if it looks unstable, I'll remove the roof of the blister. If I think it can be preserved for even one or two days, I'll leave it on. Every day it's left on without infection is a day of healing and decreased pain as new skin is made.\nFrom one paper:\n\nThere seems to be a paucity of good clinical evidence related to this subject, despite several review articles. The sole paper found involved a small sample, but showed infection rates to be higher if blisters are aspirated or deroofed, and that pain scores were higher in the group that underwent deroofing.\n\nFrom a pain point of view:\n\naspiration appears to result in less pain than deroofing. (See above: also more infection.)\n\nThe common sense comes in with type, size, and location of blister, reliability of care by the patient or their family, location or level of activity likely to cause rupture, or in the case of hikers' blisters (and others away from medical care), what the best model is to prevent infection while still using the involved area if necessary.\nAlso changing the scene are the new available protective dressings of deroofed blisters that allow moist healing, non-occlusive protection and visibility of the underlying skin. \nManagement of burns blisters\nFriction blisters.

In 2001, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Panel on Osteoporosis made the recommendation that calcium should be supplemented to maintain daily intake 1000 - 1500 mg/day in older adults. The reasoning behind this was that calcium is crucial for maintaining bone mass, which tends to deteriorate during the aging process, leaving this group at increased risk for fractures. The panel acknowledged that most older adults do not obtain this amount of calcium from their diet; they therefore suggested supplementation to this level. \nEmerging Skepticism\nSince the NIH recommendation in 2001, several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have called into question the efficacy of calcium supplementation to prevent fractures. Although total fracture risk appears to be marginally reduced, the data suggested that hip fractures, which cause the most significant morbidity and mortality, are not prevented with calcium supplementation.\nPossible Risks\nIn addition to questions about efficacy, concerns have been raised about possible increase in cardiovascular events in those receiving calcium supplements, especially women. In one RCT, postmenopauasal women were randomized to calcium supplementation or placebo. The rate ratio of myocardial infarction was 1.67 in the calcium group compared to placebo.1 \nCurrent State of Affairs  \nIn 2013 the US Preventive Services Task Force issued a statement recommending against calcium supplementation for primary prevention2 of fractures.\nSummary\nCalcium supplementation has questionable efficacy for reducing clinically important fractures, and there is evidence to suggest that it may increase cardiovascular risk. Because of these factors, large groups of smart people who spend their lives analyzing epidemiological data (read: the USPSTF) do not recommend calcium supplementation for primary prevention.\n\n\nNotes (a.k.a. my shameless plug for epidemiology education)\n\n\n1. From such data we get headlines: Calcium increases the risk of heart attack by 167%! When you see these things, have a look at the abstract with special attention to the confidence interval. Here, the interval was 0.98-2.87. Because it crosses 1, this is actually considered a not statistically significant result. Although the trend is there, and similar results have been reproduced, this broad confidence interval at least warrants some caution when thinking about what the risk really is. When interpreting data about rare outcomes, calculation of the Absolute Risk is also worthwhile for perspective.\n\n\n2. Primary prevention refers to measures to avert an undesirable outcome in people with no history of a such a problem (here, fractures). This stands in contrast to secondary prevention, which involves a population who has already experienced one incident where the goal is to prevent recurrence. The latter group is expected to be at higher risk given their demonstrated propensity for the outcome. For this reason, measures that incrementally decrease this risk tend to provide more absolute benefit compared to primary preventative measures. This is based on the principle that absolute risk reduction depends on baseline risk, an important concept to understand when evaluating this literature.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBischoff-Ferrari, HA et al. 2007.

So cause of it should be always determine by a doctor (ophthalmologist). Abnormal eye floaters are associated with bleeding in the vitreous from diabetic retinopathy, retinal tears, retinal detachment or large degrees of nearsightedness. If floaters are accompanied by flashes of light or a loss of side vision, seek medical advice immediately.\nMost eye floaters decrease/reduce in size on their own due to absorption through the natural processes within the eye. The brain also adapts to the floaters, teaching the eyes to become less aware of them. With age almost everyone has it, but some are more aware than the others.\nThere are no safe and proven methods to cure in both safe and effective way, however appropriate anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics prescribed by your doctor could reduce the number of white blood cells which are results of inflammation are common types of cellular material causing eye floaters. No other medications or eye drops have been proven effective in the treatment of eye floaters.\nThe vitreous itself can also be surgically removed by vitrectomy. It removes the actual vitreous from the eye, eliminating the eye floaters in the process, but it also increase risk of retinal detachment or cataract, so surgery should only be used as a treatment for eye floaters in extreme cases. Some laser procedures are also used to get rid of floaters, but they also contain risks.\n\nSome health professionals believe that certain nutritional supplements and lifestyle (e.g. reducing stress) changes may help get rid of eye floaters as well as certain herbs, vitamins and odine-containing products have been touted as effective in decreasing eye floaters (none of these have been proven effective in clinical trials).\nThese might include antioxidant vitamins, MSM eyedrops and hyaluronic acid to keep the eye hydrated (See: How to Reduce Floaters), for example:\n\nAntioxidant vitamins (such as turmeric, wild rose hip, propolis concentrate and hawthorn berry) in concert with other vitamins, are proven to be effective in treating macular degeneration, but not in reducing floaters. (source)\nMSM eyedrops. MSM, or methylsulfonylmethane (dimethyl sulfone), is a widely-used nutritional supplement, most notably for arthritis. For uses other than arthritis, however, studies show only dubious results. (source)\nGinko biloba has been proven effective in increasing ocular blood flow and is used by patients suffering from glaucoma. (study)\nLysine is a vasodilator, which means that it widens blood vessels, particular in large veins. Lysine has proven effective in widening blood vessels in some areas, but not necessarily in the eyes. (study)\nBilberry is used both for improving eyesight and for widening blood vessels (source). More tests are needed to investigate the efficacy of bilberry in treating floaters.\n\nNutrients which are important in managing eye floaters according to NaturalEyeCare:\n\nHyaluronic acid\n\nHyaluronic acid (hyaluronan) is a large molecule found in the vitreous gel which it is believed contributes to its gel-like quality and may also support related connective tissue. Elsewhere in the body it is found in the gel-like fluid that lubricates joints and it is a component of the tissue healing process. As we age, the amount of hyaluronan in the body decreases.\nHyaluronic acid has been shown to be effective in helping eyes heal after cataract surgery. (source)\n\nGlucosame sulfate\n\nGlucosamine sulfate helps maintain connective tissue integrity. Some floaters are caused by disintegration of the lining of the vitreous sac. This nutrient may help slow down the natural aging effect on a weakening vitreous. Many people have noted an increase in floaters when they have joint disorders which may be related to chronic, systemic inflammation and its effect on eye health.\n\nVitamin C\n\nVitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that is essential for overall eye health. Since floaters are often the result of vitreous tears/detachments and/or clumping of the vitreous due to aging, vitamin C plays a role in blood and lymph circulation, waste elimination and supporting connective tissue. It may play a role in supporting the body in breaking down eye floaters. Learn more about the role of vitamin C in the body.\n\nL-methionine\n\nThis amino acid can assist in removal of heavy metals and toxins that can contribute to eye disease. Methionine has a role in the body's synthesis of cysteine and taurine, two other important amino acids for vision health.\n\nInositol\n\nThe carbohydrate inositol plays a role in moderating levels of calcium in the cell membrane and within each cell, which in turn plays a role in protecting the vitreous.\n\nCalcium \n\nCalcium supports healthy connective tissue of the eye and throughout the body. Researchers have found that low levels of calcium (in proportion to phosphorus) is tied to increases in floaters.\n\nZinc, Copper & Chromium\n\nZinc has some antioxidant characteristics. It plays a major role in bringing Vitamin A from the liver to the retina and helps Vitamin A create a protective pigment called melanin. Zinc also helps support the health of tiny capillaries in the eye, which are essential in nourishing the retina and related connective tissue. Zinc and copper, in balance, help support a proper acid balance in the body, which in turn helps may help avoid development of new floaters. Chromium may help limit nearsightedness, a risk factor for eye floaters. Chromium also has a role in sugar balance in the body.\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\nEye Floaters at Medicine Net\nPosterior vitreous detachment (PVD)\nPars plana vitrectomy for persistent, visually significant vitreous opacities.

Oxalate (C2O42\u2212) is a dianion that combines with divalent cations such as magnesium and calcium. The magnesium salt is much more soluble than the calcium salt. Because these cations compete for binding to oxalate, both lower magnesium levels and higher calcium levels will tend to cause precipitation (movement out of solution into crystalline form) of calcium oxalate. When this happens in the urine in large enough quantities, it can form \u201cstones.\u201d\nDoes diet matter?\nAs introduced by the OP, doctors have historically advised patients who have demonstrated a propensity toward calcium oxalate stone formation (or, more generically: kidney stones) to decrease dietary intake of calcium and oxalate.\nDietary calcium \nIn 1993, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine dispelled the notion that a low calcium diet should be advised for these patients. They found the opposite association: higher calcium intake correlates with reduced stone formation (RR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.43 - 0.73). This somewhat counter-intuitive effect may be explained by the binding of calcium with oxalate in the gut, which tends to decrease oxalate absorption. The recommendation to decrease calcium intake, then, appears not to be valid. Further studies have refined this recommendation, and it is now generally said that a normal calcium intake is probably best.\nDietary oxalate \nOxalate is found in an odd assortment of foods: beets, spinach, rhubarb, strawberries, nuts, chocolate, tea, wheat bran, and all dry beans (fresh, canned, or cooked), excluding lima and green beans. This has largely been a \u201cseems like it should work\u201d approach rather than data-driven. In fact, large epidemiological studies have not shown an association between oxalate intake and stone formation.\nOther dietary associations \nThe NEJM study mentioned above also looked at other correlations between stone formation and dietary components. Animal protein was directly correlated with increased risk of stones, whereas potassium and fluid intake were correlated with decreased risk.\nA different approach \nThe most recent interesting development in this area that I\u2019m aware of was published in the American Journal of Kidney Disease in 2014 and compared the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)-style diet with a low-oxalate diet for prevention of stones. Their reasoning is nicely summarized in the abstract:\n\n[M]ost people do not eat isolated nutrients, but meals consisting of a variety of foods with complex combinations of nutrients. A more rational approach to nephrolithiasis prevention would be to base dietary advice on the cumulative effects of foods and different dietary patterns rather than single nutrients.\n\nThe DASH diet was, as its name suggests, developed as a tool to mitigate hypertension, but it has been used as a sort of paradigm \u201chealthy diet\u201d in trials of a variety of interventions. It is, as described in the paper above, high in fruits and vegetables, moderate in low-fat dairy products, and low in animal protein. The high fruit and nut content may be expected to increase urinary oxalate, but these foods also tend to be high in magnesium and citrate, both of which are inhibitors of calcium stone formation.\nThe authors collected 24-hour urine samples in participants with a known history of stones and randomized them to a DASH diet vs a low-oxalate diet. They found that urinary supersaturation of calcium oxalate (a measure of tendency to form calcium oxalate stones) was decreased in the DASH group compared to the low-oxalate group. This occurred despite a trend toward increased oxalate excretion in that group. The authors posit that this may have been due to the increased urinary pH and concentrations of citrate, magnesium, and potassium, all of which tend to decrease stone formation.\nConclusion\nThere are not solid data supporting a low oxalate diet for stone prevention. Other dietary factors that are probably helpful include: normal calcium intake; high intake of fluid, magnesium, and potassium; low animal protein.\n\nReferences\n\nBorghi L., Schianchi T., Meschi T., et al: Comparison of two diets for the prevention of recurrent stones in idiopathic hypercalciuria.

Unlike PET, X-ray, CT and most other scans, MRIs use the properties of body tissues in magnetic fields to produce an image. The MRI machine produces a powerful magnetic field which interacts with body tissues to produce radio waves, which are in turn interpreted by a computer to determine the location of the tissues.1\nThis does not, however, mean MRIs are completely without risk. First and foremost, an MRI machine is basically a giant magnet. If one has metal in his or her body, from a medical implant, car accident, or even an improperly done tattoo, the MRI machine can move it, potentially violently. In the case of medical implants, an MRI machine can easily destroy any electrical components.2 There are a number of different reasons metal might be present in the body.3 This is why MRI technologists are trained to ask, repeatedly, about any metal that may be present.\nIn addition to metal, some MRIs involve contrast media, chemicals injected or consumed that increase visibility of certain tissues in MRI scans. These chemicals are normally removed by the body rather quickly, and except in individuals with reduced kidney function, are for the most part safe. However, there have been cases of allergic reactions and side effects.4 Also, recently, questionable studies have presented possible links between gadolinium-based contrast agents and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, though the American FDA has stated that this link is only significant in patients with kidney disease, as \"NSF has not been reported in patients with normal kidney function\".5\nIn Short\nIn healthy individuals, with properly-functioning kidneys, no medical implants, no improperly-done tattoos, and no metal embedded in the body, MRIs are completely safe, once or even quite often.\n", "computers - How can I avoid voice strain when using speech recognition all day long?": "\nThere are several good tips to help avoid voice strain. \n\nLike you said, drink a lot of water (6-8 glasses a day); also, limit your intake of caffeinated drinks or alcoholic drinks, as they dry your throat\nWhen you are talking, support your voice with deep breaths, like singers have to; speaking from your diaphragm puts less stress on your voice and also make you talk clearer \n\nIf you start to feel that you are getting voice strain, stop talking and just rest for a little while. \n\n\n\nTaking Care of Your Voice\n", "dermatology - When applying Neospirin to a wound, why is it advised to apply only a thin layer of it?": "\nLike many medications you want to use the amount necessary, no more, no less.

Decades of (amateur) athletics have taught me that the magic to treating tendinitis is to identify it early and stop aggravating it. \nA little bit of tendinitis is a lot easier to work through than a lot of it. \nIn the \"good vs bad pain\" continuum, tendinitis is very much on the \"bad\" spectrum. In large part this is why proper training spends so much time ensuring that you don't develop overuse injuries (such as tendinitis) since it is so debilitating and can easily sideline progress for weeks.\n", "How to distinguish a non-inflammatory tendinopathy (a.k.a tendinosis) from an inflammatory tendinopathy (a.k.a. tendinitis)?": "\nBasically, something falls under the classification of \"inflammed\" based on the following five criteria:\n\nRedness\nSwelling\nHeat\nPain\nLoss of Function\n\nIf any of these apply to your tendinopathy, then it is probably tendinitis. Otherwise, it's probably non-inflammatory.\n", "Effect of dexamethasone iontophoreses on tendons": "\nThe penetration is limited, therefore it's less risky than a steroid injection which carries a higher risk of tendon rupture(1).\nStudy conclusion from 1999 (PDF) by SMJ was:\n\nIontophoresis using sterile water or corticosteroid resulted in minimal or no biochemical and histologic changes in the tendon compared with injection of either substance. The method of corticosteroid delivery may be as important as the actual drug effects on the biomechanical and histologic properties of tendons.\n\n", "Should I go to the occupational therapist or the physical therapist if I have a tendinopathy in the USA?": "\nYou should probably go to a physical therapist. Physicals therapists are more specialized in that they will treat the actual injury and its source. \n\"Occupational therapy (OT) addresses patients' impairments and functional limitations with the purpose of increasing their capability to complete activities of daily living (ADLs).\" Occupational therapy is more for helping people get on with their everyday life, usually when you have a permanent disabilities, such as an amputated limb. They help people do things such as bath and cook independently. \n\"Physical therapy (PT) is a health profession that focuses on the movement of the human body. Physical therapists (PTs) and physical therapy assistants (PTAs) treat patients of all ages with physical impairments and functional limitations as a result of a medical condition or injury.\" Physical therapy is more for injuries that can be fixed (not 100% of the time, but close to it). This fits what you need, so the better option would be to go to a physical therapist.\n\nThe Difference Between Occupational and Physical Therapy\n", "Why are inflammations painful in the case of a tendinitis?": "\n\nWhy are inflammations painful in the case of a tendinitis?\nWhen suffering from tendinitis, does the inflammation itself cause any\n  pain, and if so why?\n\nBased on the definition of tendinitis actually meaning inflammation of a tendon, what's typically associated with this condition, and the body's immune system response with it stimulating nerve cells and triggering pain, inflammation can and does cause pain.  \n\nDefinition (1)\nTendinitis is inflammation or irritation of a tendon \u2014 any one of the\n  thick fibrous cords that attaches muscle to bone. The condition causes\n  pain and tenderness just outside a joint. (1)\n\nWhen swelling occurs and the immune system responds accordingly, this process can also stimulate nerves and trigger the pain effect so based on this, that is WHY inflammation causes pain with tendinitis or any other condition for this matter with the human body.\n\nWebMD - Inflammation (2)\nWhen inflammation occurs, chemicals from the body's white blood cells\n  are released into the blood or affected tissues to protect your body\n  from foreign substances. This release of chemicals increases the blood\n  flow to the area of injury or infection, and may result in redness and\n  warmth. Some of the chemicals cause a leak of fluid into the tissues,\n  resulting in swelling. This protective process may stimulate nerves\n  and cause pain.

Although the body's maximal store of vitamin C is largely determined by the renal threshold for blood.\nHowever if you exceed the upper limits of your body/bowel tolerance, in general any drug overdose is dangerous causing some side effects. Relatively large doses of ascorbic acid may cause indigestion, particularly when taken on an empty stomach and it can case diarrhoea. In one trial in 1936 (6g doses) toxic manifestations were observed in 5/29 adults and 4/93. Symptoms of Vitamin C overdose could include: skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, facial flushing, headache, fatigue and disturbed sleep. As well as itchy skin (prurutis), dizziness and abdominal pain.\nIt's usually advised to take smaller doses more frequently (e.g. ever hour), than larger doses in short amount of time in order to simulate endogenous production and increase your tolerance threshold. On the other hand your body would \"learn\" daily intake and it will expect similar doses on daily basis.\nSource: Vitamin C\n", "nutrition - Are artificial sweeteners safe?": "\nIntroduction\nThere have been numerous studies on this topic, and there are a number of artificial sweeteners, so the following is a discussion of three of the most important, saccharin, cyclamate and aspartame, as well as three more which are currently approved for use in food by the FDA, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, and neotame, in less detail.\nSaccharin\nThere have been over 50 studies discussing saccharin, specifically its effects on rats, especially regarding cancer. About 20 of these involved rats consuming saccharin for over 1.5 years, nineteen of which found no significant differences between rats fed saccharin and rats not fed saccharin.1 The cancer-positive study did find a link between saccharin and bladder cancer, but used a type of rat susceptible to bladder cancer.2 3\nThere have also been multi-generational studies in which saccharin was fed to rats and their offspring, and found that male, second-generation rats fed saccharin were more at risk for bladder cancer than male, second-generation rats not fed saccharin.4 5 However, the same link could not be found in humans, as studies have found that cancer in rats is not a good predictor of cancer in humans. For example, low doses of Vitamin C cause cancer in rats.6 With no conclusive evidence linking saccharin to human health risk, bans on saccharin were lifted, at least in the United States.7\nCyclamate\nAfter being approved by the FDA for use in food in 1951, cyclamate became a common artificial sweetener in American households. After a study in 1969 found links between cyclamate and bladder cancer in rats,8 the FDA banned cyclamate in food.\nLater, a long-term study was conducted in which monkeys were fed cyclamate every day for 24 years. One group was fed cyclamate at dosages equivalent to 6 cans of diet soda a day, another at dosages equivalent to 30 cans of diet soda a day. The study concluded that there is no significant link between cyclamate and cancer in monkeys.9 While a petition has been filed with the FDA for the lifting of the cyclamate ban, however, the petition is not being actively considered for reasons unrelated to cancer.10\nAspartame\nApproved for use in food by the FDA in 1981, a 1996 study posited a possible link between a general increase in brain tumor incidence and aspartame.11 A multitude of studies followed, among the largest of which found no link between aspartame consumption and brain tumors,12 and no link between aspartame consumption and changes in brain function.13\nAt one point, an editorial intended to directly address the 1996 study revealed that the conclusion was largely the result of ecological fallacy, essentially blind assumption.14 Of course, this is a small sample of the large numbers of studies conducted, including a human study that found little evidence that aspartame is likely to act as a human brain carcinogen.15\nEventually, the FDA released a statement citing a press release by the European Food Safety Authority. The statement, in addition to declaring its intent to better study aspartame, stated that the FDA has not been presented with scientific information that would support a change in its conclusions about the safety of aspartame.16\nAcesulfame potassium, Sucralose and Neotame\nAcesulfame potassium was approved by the FDA for use in food in 1988. Sucralose was approved by the FDA for use in food in 1998. Neotame was approved by the FDA for use in food in 2002.\nThe FDA states that it reviewed more than 100 safety studies before approving these sweeteners, and that the results of these studies showed no evidence that these sweeteners cause cancer or pose any other threat to human health.17\nIn Short\nThere have been a number of studies reviewing the safety of common artificial sweeteners, with mixed results. However, the quorum conclusion appears to be that even in very high doses, these substances are safe for human consumption. Note, however, that a number of artificial sweeteners were not discussed above, some of which may pose health risks.\n", "Is there evidence that eating too much sugar can increase the risk of diabetes?": "\nHigh consumption of sugar can up the risk of diabetes, but it is not the only contributing factor. There have been studies that have shown that sugar-sweetened drinks (mainly soda) have increased the probability of type 2 diabetes.1 There is a less subtle way that sugar can cause diabetes, which is by weight gain.2 Obesity has been shown to cause diabetes3 and too much sugar can cause obesity, so technically sugar can cause obesity.\nIn conclusion, sugar is fine in moderation (as most things are) and usually it won't cause diabetes. There are some links between the two though.\n\n[1]  Consumption of sweet beverages and type 2 diabetes incidence in European adults: results from EPIC-InterAct.\n[2]  Fructose, weight gain, and the insulin resistance syndrome\n[3]  Why Does Obesity Causes Diabetes?\n", "eye - How can I protect my eyesight when using computers?": "\n20-20-20 Rule\nEvery 20 minutes of looking at the screen, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

It may also decrease pain, inflammation and muscle control problems. CBD does not affect the mind, but it can be useful in reducing pain and inflammation, controlling epileptic seizures and possibly treating mental illness and addictionsNIH 2014.\nTreatment for cancer\nMarijuana (whole unprocessed plant or its basic extracts) kills cancer cells and it has been confirmed by US government. The federal government funded research was carried by NIDA and the publication admits that cannabis has medicinal value2014:\n\nRecent animal studies have shown that marijuana can kill certain cancer cells and reduce the size of others.\nEvidence from one animal study suggests that extracts from whole-plant marijuana can shrink one of the most serious types of brain tumors.\nResearch in mice showed that these extracts, when used with radiation, increased the cancer-killing effects of the radiation.\n\nThe U.S. Food and FDA conducted studies to determine the benefits and risks, however not recognized or approved marijuana plant as medicine for cancer, because researchers did not conducted enough large-scale clinical trials which showed the health benefits.\nA molecular biologist from Spain, Dr. Christina Sanchez explains has been studying the anti-tumor effects of THC for over a decade and she explains how it kills cancer cells entirely. See the video for more details.\nHealth benefits\nOther potential health benefits can include:\n\nCannabinoids as antioxidants and neuroprotectants.\nPatent US6630507 by 3 scientists from the Department of Health and Human Services which describe in abstract:\n\nCannabinoids have been found to have antioxidant properties, unrelated to NMDA receptor antagonism. This new found property makes cannabinoids useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of wide variety of oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age-related, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The cannabinoids are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and HIV dementia. Nonpsychoactive cannabinoids, such as cannabidoil, are particularly advantageous to use because they avoid toxicity that is encountered with psychoactive cannabinoids at high doses useful in the method of the present invention.\n\n\nNonpsychoactive CBD anti-tumor activity.\nStudy published in the journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics state that cannabis having anti-tumor effects and found it could be the answer to the increasing number of treatment-resistant cancers.\nItalian researchers published a study in The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics which tested cannabidiol on human brain tumor cells and they've found that the non-psychoactive cannabis compound to have detrimental effects on the viability of these cells, inhibiting their growth \u201csignificantly\u201d.\n\nAntiproliferative action on brain tumour cells.\nA study found in the British Journal of Cancer found that THC and other cannabinoids were able to inhibit the growth of brain tumors. In two out of nine patients, the compounds were able to decrease the number of tumor cells, all without psychoactive effects.\n\nThe cannabinoid system can serve to protect the brain against neurodegeneration.\nThe Journal of Neuroscience contains another study from 2001 in which THC-treated rats received neuro-protective benefits. Neuro-degeneration refers to progressively worsening brain function commonly found in age-related dementia but also when the brain is damaged. The researchers found that rats treated with THC were protected against such damage, indicating it as a potential solution for slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease and also acute damage that could occur as a result of directed tumor treatment.\n\nAntibacterial effects of cannabinoids\nA 2008 study led by Appendino et al. demonstrated that cannabinoids have antibacterial activity even on MRSA. They stated that:\n\n\n\nAll five major cannabinoids (cannabidiol (1b), cannabichromene (2), cannabigerol (3b), Delta (9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (4b), and cannabinol (5)) showed potent activity against a variety of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains of current clinical relevance.\n\n\nAs a side note, in Hindu texts cannabis was known as \u2018sacred grass\u2019.

Six of the unvaccinated were babies, too young to be vaccinated.\n  (source)\n\nSimply put, unvaccinated individuals are more likely to be carrying a vaccine-preventable disease compared to the rest of the population. If your newborn is not vaccinated yet he or she is at risk.

I saw only one nearly 40-year-old study on PubMed,  Warzawer-Schwarcz L. \"Treatment of plantar warts with banana skin.\" Plast Reconstr Surg. 1981 Dec;68(6):975-6. http://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Citation/1981/12000/Treatment_of_Plantar_Warts_With_Banana_Skin.35.aspx\nThis study involved taping fresh banana peel every day to the wart using surgical tape, and then scraping chunks out of the softened wart repeatedly. It seems like the primary function of the banana peel was to make the skin damp and soft for scraping. I actually think using just duct tape instead could accomplish a similar function (keeping skin damp), with the advantage that the tape can naturally pull off chunks of wart when you rip it off. Another study found that duct tape actually can be effective for wart removal; researchers theorize this is because the duct tape may be stimulating the immune system (see here: https://www.webmd.com/men/news/20021015/duct-tape-gets-rid-of-warts). Also, personal story, when I was a kid I got rid of a wart on my hand using the duct tape method. \nMy main recommendation, though, would be to try freezing it off again, or getting it cut out. I don't know how many times you've tried freezing it, but warts can be fairly determined and may require multiple freezings to disappear. You may also want to try a different dermatologist - perhaps your current dermatologist doesn't have good freezing technique. You can also have the wart cut out, though that will have longer recovery time. \nI think you've got a lot of options - don't give up! Sometimes a combination of therapies can be effective. For example, I once also got rid of a wart on my foot using drug store salicylic acid stickers, repeated scraping to remove dead skin and dead wart tissue, followed by freezing. \nAdditional information: Warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV16 and HPV18 cause cervical cancer; HPV6 and HPV11 cause genital warts and laryngeal papillomatosis; but there are also many types of HPV that are not sexually transmitted and merely cause skin warts (see the Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus_infection). \n", "hygiene - Wound precautions in public facilities?": "\nAs a rule of thumb:   anywhere that blood is coming out, you should be assuming that pathogens can be transferred in.

The slower you metabolize caffeine, the more effect it will have on you. The cause for the differences that people have in how fast they metabolize caffeine has to depend on the CYP1A2 gene. Variants of this gene can cause you to metabolize faster or slower. The C allele variant in the AHR gene, which controls the turning on and off the the CYP1A2 gene, is common in people who have a high metabolism for caffeine. You probably do not have this variant. That with a few other factors that depend on variants in your DNA are the reason that caffeine has a strong effect on you.\n\nCaffeine Consumption\n", "What topical applications can assist wound healing and prevent scarring?": "\nIt greatly depends on the wound: is it clean or infected? A cut on an abrasion? Acute or chronic. Associated with disease (diabetes), immobility (pressure) or other? Is it a burn?\nHoney is often overlooked. It is an antibacterial and a humectant, both helping wounds to heal better. Epidermal growth factor also helps but is not easy to get. Silver is preferred for burns (nanosilver is making an appearance). Collagen gels and other topicals are helpful.

They could affect the skin and mucous membranes in ways that are valuable or harmful.\nFor example steam-distilled eucalyptus oil is used as a primary cleaning/disinfecting agent added to soaped mop and countertop cleaning solutions, however there are hundreds of species of eucalyptus and dozens are used as sources of essential oils, so products of different species differ greatly in characteristics and effects and also the products of the very same tree can vary grosslywiki.\nSome other studies show that tea tree oil is capable of killing MRSA in a laboratory setting, however there is insufficient evidence. A 2012 review by the NIH rates Tea tree oil as \"possibly effective\" for: treating acne, fungal toenail infection or symptoms of athlete's foot. Which indicates its antibacterial properties only against certain infection.\nOn the other hand some other essential oils generally should not be applied directly to the skin in their undiluted or \"neat\" form, as can cause potential danger such as severe irritation, provoke an allergic reaction and, over time, prove hepatotoxic. Some other, including many of the citrus peel oils, are photosensitizers, increasing the skin's vulnerability to sunlight.\nIn summary, non-therapeutic grade essential oils are never recommended for topical or internal use (including animals, which could cause extreme hepatotoxicity and dermal toxicity), unless specific essential oil has pharmaceutical properties and you know they're safe for use, however they're not good alternative to alcohol-based disinfectant products.\n", "dentistry - For long-term use: Non-Alcoholic Mouthwash vs Saltwater": "\nComparing \"saltwater\" to non-alcoholic mouthwash may be too general.\nIf I remember correctly, pH is dependent on OH- (hydroxide) and H+ (Hydrogen) levels. Depending on the type of salt, let's say NaCl (table salt), water will recombine with the salt, but OH and H levels aren't affected. Na binds to OH and H binds to CL in equal quantity.\nRegarding the following that I found below, I believe \"alkalinize\" can't be taken to mean below neutral. I think it means that it lowers the pH level, whether to basic or less acidic. How I think of it is that you start with a highly acidic environment due to the bacteria. Then you use something with less acidity to average out the pH. \n\n\"Salt water rinses are good because they alkalinize the mouth (opposite of acidify, which is what the bacteria create.) Use one-half teaspoon each of baking soda and salt in a cup of warm water. The alkalinity helps decrease the bacteria count because they like an acid environment. As far as hot or cold, I'm not sure it matters. The rise in pH (alkalinity) is temporary. That is why the docs are promoting the Peridex, because they last longer.\"1\n\nHowever, I believe that the acidity is relative. So for short term, it kills the bacteria, but for long term I believe Dr. Kerr is correct: it erodes teeth, which are made from Ca+ and probably fall to influence of the Cl- present in the solution.\nCetylpyridinium chloride is a modern anti-sceptic. Despite the hazards of LARGE quantity exposure, \"CPC was one of only three antimicrobial systems to be classified as safe and efficacious for the treatment of plaque-induced gingivitis, along with stannous fluoride and essential oils.\"2 So it's safe in the amounts we use.

The only thing you can do is make sure your skin is not damaged in the first place.\n\nSkin damage is caused by a variety of factors, but by far the most important one for most people is UV exposure. The primary source of UV is the Sun, but tanning booths may be a significant factor for some people.\nWhile sun burn causes an extreme amount of damage, all sun exposure will have an effect. If you are in the sun often, cover your skin, and wear high-factor sun cream on any exposed areas.\nSkin is made up of layers:\n\nImage source: nih.gov\nSkin damage from UV occurs when the rays reach and burn the dermis. This damage changes the cells' DNA, by creating free radicals. For this reason, although the cells are replaced every 21 days, the new cells inherit the same damage.

Since the potential to use TTO against MRSA was first hypothesized (153), several groups have evaluated the activity of TTO against MRSA, beginning with Carson et al. (31), who examined 64 MRSA isolates from Australia and the United Kingdom, including 33 mupirocin-resistant isolates. The MICs and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for the Australian isolates were 0.25% and 0.5%, respectively, while those for the United Kingdom isolates were 0.312% and 0.625%, respectively. Subsequent reports on the susceptibility of MRSA to TTO have similarly not shown great differences compared to antibiotic-sensitive organisms (39, 58, 68, 106, 115).\n\nfrom: Melaleuca alternifolia (Tea Tree) Oil: a Review of Antimicrobial and Other Medicinal Properties C.

Riley1,2,*, Clin Microbiol Rev. 2006 Jan; 19(1): 50\u201362.\n\nin vivo - clinical efficcacy in at least one study\n\nBy the same source:\n\nOne of the first rigorous clinical studies assessed the efficacy of 5% TTO in the treatment of acne by comparing it to 5% benzoyl peroxide (BP) (14). The study found that both treatments reduced the numbers of inflamed lesions, although BP performed significantly better than TTO. The BP group showed significantly less oiliness than the TTO group, whereas the TTO group showed significantly less scaling, pruritis, and dryness. Significantly fewer overall side effects were reported by the TTO group (27 of 61 patients) than by the BP group (50 of 63 patients).\n\nWhether the effect will be bactericidal (killing bacteria) or  bacteriostatic (stopping their reproduction) depends on the concentration:\n\nTTO is for the most part bactericidal in nature, although it may be bacteriostatic at lower concentrations.\n\n", "eye - Do carrots actually improve eyesight?": "\nThis is debunked with little reference on Snopes.  It is claimed there that the origin of the myth was deliberate misinformation to hide the use of a game-changing technology used by the RAF to shoot down German planes.  This claim regarding the propaganda origin is sourced a bit better at the Wikipedia article on one of the officers.\nThe grain-of-truth (which probably helps perpetuate the myth) is mentioned in the Snopes article as well and partially backed up at the (archived) CDC article on carrots that they link to:\n\nBeta-carotene, which is found in the vegetable, may help reduce the risk of cataract and macular degeneration. However, it needs be pointed out that studies which have posited this link used doses of Vitamin A or beta-carotene that were higher than what is found in the standard diet. It would be quite difficult to eat the requisite number of carrots to match this level of intake. Also, among those who suffer a Vitamin A deficiency, nyctanopia (also known as nyctalopia or night blindness; the inability to see well in poor light) can be at least somewhat helped by adding carrots to the sufferer's diet.\n\n", "sleep - How to reduce apnea/hypoapnea events?": "\nThe Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) is a measure of severity in obstructive sleep apnea. It is calculated as the number of times per hour that the airway partially or completely collapses, associated with a drop in oxygen levels.  Partial collapse is labeled a hypopnea, whereas complete collapse is labeled an apnea. CPAP treatment uses air pressure delivered through a mask to stent open the airway. If there continues to be partial or complete collapse despite CPAP, the basic idea, in theory, is that the pressure is inadequate.\nThe major caveat: \nWhere are you getting this AHI? Most likely, you\u2019re reading it off a PAP machine. The upshot of this answer is that, as much as we all love numbers, such readings should not be trusted.\nThe AHI was initially validated in the setting of overnight polysomnography, i.e. a sleep lab. There a technician watches the tracings generated from a nasal pressure transducer, chest/abdomen effort belts, and continuous pulse oximetry. There are specific criteria for scoring apneas and hypopneas. The recommended criteria from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine for a hypopnea are now:\n\na. The peak signal excursions drop by \u226530% of pre-event baseline using nasal pressure...\nb. The duration of the \u226530% drop in signal excursion is \u226510 seconds.\nc. There is a \u22653% oxygen desaturation from pre-event baseline and/or the event is associated with an arousal.\n\nThere has been a lot of controversy in recent years as to whether that number in the c criterion should be 3% or 4% drop in pulse oximetry. Why should we care? \nThe number you\u2019re getting off your PAP machine has no pulse oximetry to correlate with. They must therefore be using some other non-standard metric. How do they calculate this? This, unfortunately, is proprietary information known only to the PAP manufacturers. Occasionally there are validation studies of varying quality published, but there is no uniformity in the industry as to what algorithm is used, and there is very little transparency about where these numbers are coming from. \nWhat, then?\nMonitoring of sleep apnea treatment is symptom-based. If symptoms improve, good enough, keep with it. If there is inadequate improvement or recurrence of symptoms after improvement, things should be re-evaluated. Generally this involves one or more of the following:   \n\nassessing the interface (Is the mask leaking? That will cause inadequate pressure delivered to the airway.)\nhome overnight pulse oximetry  \nadjustment of the settings on an auto-titrating machine to allow for higher pressures  \nempirically increasing the pressure on a fixed-pressure CPAP  \na repeat sleep study while using PAP, adjusting the pressure settings (i.e. a titration study)\n\nConclusion: Most likely, in the next few years these technologies will get better, and hopefully transparency and uniformity will improve. In the meantime, take the AHI number on your CPAP machine with a grain of salt.\n\n\nKryger, Roth, Dement. Principles and Practice of Sleep Medicine.

While it usually lasts 1-6 weeks, it can persist for up to 10 weeks, followed by a convalescent period.\nOne reason for the long duration of the cough is that by the time one has reached that phase of disease, they are largely beyond the help of antibiotics, which will not shorten the clinical course of the disease in infected patients, but are intended to prevent its transmission to others.\nAdditionally, the actual mechanism of action for pertussis helps making the coughing longer. Bordetalla pertussis infect the upper respiratory system and bind to the lining of your respiratory system, decreasing the movement of your cilia, which serve to help clear mucous from your lungs. They also produce toxins which can cause inflammation and damage the cilia. As a result, even once the bacteria are dead, there is lingering damage to your respiratory system that will result in continued coughing.\n", "nutrition - How should ovo-lacto vegetarians compensate the lack of meat in their diets?": "\nThere are a few considerations when looking at a healthy lacto-ovo vegetarian diet.\nComplete Proteins\nThis is fairly easy in this type of diet, as eggs contain complete proteins. There are also a few plant sources (such as quinoa, buckwheat and hempseed) that contain either a complete protein profile or the 9 essential amino acids in good amounts. Hempseed also contains Omega-3 fatty acids which can be difficult to get without seafood.\nHealthy Fats\nOne of the main reasons for healthy fats in the diet is for the proper transport of fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) into the body. Nuts and avocados are examples of healthy fats, as are olives and olive oils. If possible, for olive oils get extra virgin and as fresh as possible, as this will ensure the highest levels of polyphenols.\nAlong with the basic considerations, you need to be aware of possible deficiencies due to age, sex, things of this nature. For example, this study suggests that B-12 deficiency can be a problem in pregnant lacto-ovo vegetarians. High soy intake can possibly impact estrogen levels in both men and women, and possibly delay maturation/height in maturing individuals, although this is only a precaution (most of what I've read suggests further studies are needed).\nI would talk with a nutritionist and/or doctor about the diet, and why you want to follow it. There's no reason you can't be healthy and safe about whatever diet plan you choose.\n", "diabetes - Fasting blood glucose and Hemoglobin A1C not valid for athletes?": "\nWhen you say\n\nIn one of my most recent blood panels (for a medical study group) came back with HbA1c levels that indicated I was prediabetic, but again, follow up studies were negative.\n\nWhat was the HbA1C level, and what follow-up study was negative?\nIn the Lippi study, HbA1c values between sedentary individuals and professional cyclists were 5.2 +/- 0.3% versus 5.4 +/- 0.2% respectively. That's really fairly marginal. Normal levels are below 5.7 percent. \nHbA1C levels are indeed valid concerns for athletes, as valid as for anyone else. The risk of heart disease, however, is lower in this group in spite of the elevated A1C because of fitness levels.\nGlucose molecules don't respect elite cyclists more than couch potatoes. End-organ damage (through glycosylation) is the primary concern here.

As so, any blood test with slightly elevated value may be normal, since all healthy individuals does not belong to the 95% confidence interval on which the \"normal\" values are based. As so you should not be automatically concerned if your blood level is above \"normal\".  Of course this does not imply that fact that you should refer to your GP for more information and further investigation.\n", "dermatology - Is there a complete cure for Limited Scleroderma?": "\nThere is no complete cure for Limited Scleroderma (LS).

All substances circulating in your body (including bacteria, yeast, excess protein/sugar can make their way there. It's an important part of your body's disposal process and it's useful tool of diagnosis.\nTomas Griebling, MD, MPH (vice chair of the urology department at the University of Kansas) says:\n\nFrom a historical view, urinalysis was one of the original windows into what's happening in the body.\n\nAnthony Smith, MD (professor and chief of urology at the University of New Mexico) says:\n\nThe urine is there primarily to get rid of toxins or things that would otherwise build up in the body that would be bad for the body.\n\n\nUrine gets it color from the urochrome pigment and it ranges between light straw/yellow and dark/deep amber (honey). Darker color is normally when you're urinating first in the morning (this indicates your liver was busy at night to get rid of toxins).

Different medicines have different half-lives. And 'half-life' is the factor that mostly decides the 'dosage/timings'. \nBut, if you go by general guidelines, all doctors agree upon one thing:\n\nTake a missed pill the moment you remember it. But then, if it is almost the time for the next dose, skip it. That said, don't ever take two pills together (compensating the missed dose).\n\nThe best practice is ask your healthcare provider about it. They can precisely tell you what should you do (though most of them would advise what I wrote). \n", "muscle - When to stretch as a sportsman": "\nThere are three main types of stretching that the general layman will be familiar with. There are a couple of others, but they are extreme techniques, and generally not used by the everyday athlete.\n\nBallistic - The \"lean and bounce\" method, where you repeatedly bob back and forth in the stretch\nDynamic - Mimics the motion of the activity in increasing amplitude\nStatic - Traditional \"lean and hold\" type of stretching.\n\nBallistic is old fashioned, and has been contraindicated for quite a while. One of the big risks is activating the stretch reflex in the tendon (This is what causes your knee to jerk when the doctor whacks you with the hammer), and this causes your muscle to try and tighten (shorten) at the same time you are actively lengthening it. This can produce tears, avulsions or tendon ruptures.\nDynamic is recommended before activity, especially if you are doing an activity that requires great extremes of motion (Such as martial arts or gymnastics). This is simply doing the motions of the sport starting with slow, short movements and gradually increasing the range and power. Skips into bounds before running is one example of this. As evidenced by this study, dynamic stretching before activity showed greater gains in jump power, where ballistic and static stretching did not show the same gains.\nStatic should be done after activity if it is done. Several studies have shown that static stretching before activity (especially in power based activities) actually decreases performance. The main purpose of static stretching is to increase range of motion (ROM) in the area being stretched. This study shows a decreased resistance to passive resistive torque (How far the joint can move before resistance begins), i.e. gains in flexibility with static where ballistic did not show the improvement. Ballistic did, however, reduce stiffness in the studied tendon (Achilles).\nThere is currently no evidence that stretching will alleviate muscle pain, and while it is popular to do, not much evidence that it helps alleviate cramps, either. Static stretching (contrary to popular belief) has also not been proven to reduce injury rates (As shown by this review article of the literature) or assist with such things as delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), \"flush\" lactate out of the muscles, or anything. If it helps relax you, or if you need extreme ranges of motion for a specific sport, it can help, but other than that, there isn't much evidence for it to support performance increases.\nAlso, since you mention that you play baseball, there is some evidence (Although I can't find the study at the moment) that preswing warmups should be done with a lightweight bat rather than a weighted bat, as it helps increase the following swing speeds.\nAddition: While reading through references, I did find some notations that ballistic stretching post exercise could possibly produce greater gains in flexibility, at the cost of a higher injury risk.\n", "headache - What are the symptoms of Migraine and how to categorise into severe or mild etc": "\nHow to identify migraine\nTraditionally, if you had headaches you would discuss your symptoms with a doctor who would then classify the type of headache you had based on what you reported. If you didn't think of something to report, or didn't think (for example) that your nausea was related to your headaches (and so didn't report it), then your headache type may be misdiagnosed. Personally, I received several different \"headache diagnoses\" over the years, depending on how I reported my symptoms and the doctor I was seeing at the time.\nIn 2003, a group of researchers published a study (Lipton) where they determined the ID Migraine test was a reliable screening test for determining whether a patient had migraine. This test was further validated by additional studies in 2011 (Cousins), and has since been translated into additional languages and studied further (Karli). \nID Migraine Test\nThe ID Migraine test is considered positive for migraine if the patient answers yes to 2 or more of the following 3 questions:\n\nHas a headache limited your activities for a day or more in the last three months?\nAre you nauseated or sick to your stomach when you have a headache?\nDoes light bother you when you have a headache?\n\nMigraine Symptoms \nMore generally, the symptoms of migraine may include:\n\nPain on one side or both sides of your head\nPain that has a pulsating, throbbing quality\nSensitivity to light, sounds and sometimes smells\nNausea and vomiting\nBlurred vision\nLightheadedness, sometimes followed by fainting\nAura \n\n\nVisual phenomena, such as seeing various shapes, bright spots or flashes of light\nVision loss\nPins and needles sensations in an arm or leg\nSpeech or language problems (aphasia)\n\n\nHow to classify severity of migraine\nSeverity of migraine is usually judged based on how the symptoms affect the patient's ability to conduct daily activities. There are several scales available to test this, but the two most popular seem to be the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) and the Headache Impact Test (HIT).\nMIDAS\nMIDAS was developed in 2001 (Steward) and is based on asking the patient to count the number of days they have been impacted by their headaches (specifically addressing work, household, and social activities). The more days a person is impacted, the more severe their migraine is considered.  MIDAS can be found online at the American Headache Society.\nHIT\nHIT is a newer test, developed in 2011 (Yang). It asks the patient to consider the impact of migraine on their activities in the past 4 weeks, on a five point scale that progresses from \"Never\" to \"Always\". Having more responses on the positive end of the scale (Sometimes/Very Often/Always) will indicate that a person is more severely affected by migraine. The HIT can be found online on the National Headaches Foundation.\nReferences\nCousins G1, Hijazze S, Van de Laar FA, Fahey T.

This can be also triggered by Exercise-induced asthma (EIA).\n\n\nThe neurotransmitter acetylcholine is known to decrease sympathetic response by slowing the heart rate and constricting the smooth muscle tissue. Ongoing research and successful clinical trials have shown that agents such as diphenhydramine, atropine and Ipratropium bromide (act as receptor antagonists of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) are effective for treating asthma and COPD-related symptoms.wiki\n\nStudies from 2000 has been shown that both exercise and drinking ice water can induce airways obstruction, however there is a limited interpretation of results, because of the difficulty of separating the temperature and humidity of the airways during experiments (where airway microcirculation could be an important factor).\nSo how cold the water should be? I don't think it's possible to answer and it really depends on the individual organism and many other factors. If more studies would follow, it would give you only the averages, nothing more.\nThe following study used ice water (0-4\u00b0C) and warm water 37\u00b0C:\n\nEffect of ice water ingestion on asthmatic children after exercise challenge. (2000)\n\nThirty Chinese asthmatic children underwent exercise challenge by ergocyclometer for 6 minutes and then were further challenged by immediate ingestion of ice water (200 ml, 0-4 degrees C), warm water (200 ml, 37 degrees C) or no ingestion on three different days in one week. Each patient completed the three different water ingestion tests after exercise challenge.\nExercise-induced asthma (EIA) developed in about two thirds of the 30 patients, regardless of whether ice water, warm water or nothing at all was ingested after exercise challenge. There was no statistically significant difference in spirometric data among the 3 different water tests at various time points.\nA statistically significant difference was found between ice water and warm water tests for FEV1 and PEF (p = 0.0293 and p = 0.0308 respectively).\nThose who ingested warm water after exercise had a better bronchodilator response than those who ingested ice water.\n\n\nIf they had ice in it - I don't know. However based on the above you should drink warm water just to be safer.\n", "How to handle cold in summers with nose bleeding issues?": "\nI can't address how you can avoid your body temperature rising with certain foods like almonds or raisins, as I'm unfamiliar with that issue. Soups can be eaten cold or at room temperature, and you can lower your body temperature slightly with iced drinks, quick sponge baths, etc.\nBut controlling the most frequent causes of nosebleeds might help you reduce their occurrance.\nThe vast majority of bloody noses in healthy individuals (by that, I mean people without specific diseases of the blood or mucous membranes, etc.) arise from one specific area in the nose (on either side):\n\nIn the mucosa of the nasal septum (the cartilagenous structure separating the nose into two sides), there is an area where several arteries \"meet\", giving it an exceptionally rich vascular supply, called Kiesselbach's plexus. It is on the anterior surface, and exposed to dry air and trauma (even such as might be sustained by a bad cold). People often get nosebleeds from nasal mucosal irritation due to upper respiratory infections. Bleeding typically occurs when the mucosa erodes for any reason, and the capillaries and venules (and sometimes arterioles) become exposed and subsequently break. The result is the familiar bloody dripping of a nosebleed.\nThe most common treatment is direct pressure (squeezing the sides of the nose together) for 5-10 minutes. This works because putting direct pressure on any bleed stops the blood flow long enough for a clot to form and the arteriole to close down. If needed, more aggressive control can be achieved by a professional.\nBesides the immediate treatment of bloody noses, anything that helps with the integrity of the nasal mucosa is going to help reduce nosebleeds. One can \n\nrun a humidifier in dry weather\navoid irritating by touching the nose or blowing nose too often\napply a very light layer of petrolatum or Bacitracin ointment to the inside of the nose covering Kiesselbach's plexus at night so the nose-breathing doesn't dry out your nose\nuse nasal saline spray to moisten and soothe the nasal membranes (don't rub the tip of the spray bottle against the nasal membranes, though) \n\n*more serious or recurrent bleeding needs medical attention to rule out  other conditions that are associated with frequent nose bleeds.\nEdited to reflect additional information.\nEpistaxis\n", "nutrition - What are the health benefits and risks of ingesting Aloe vera?": "\nWhat is Aloe vera?\nAloe vera is the common name of one particular species of the genus Aloe (member of the Xanthorrhoeaceae family). There are over 420 different plant species and the most commonly used in consumer products. Most commonly used is Aloe barbadensis, Aloe barbadensis (Mill.) or (Miller) or Aloe vera (L.) Burm. f. (scientific name).\nProcessing\nThe primary component of the plant used in most products is the leaf, which can be processed in two ways to make aloe vera juice, powder or concentrate.\nThe other substance found within the leaf that has been used in commerce, primarily as an OTC laxative drug, is the aloe latex. \nFor oral consumption Aloe vera needs to be carefully filtered by different processing procedures:\n\nAloe vera leaf juice\nA charcoal filtration process which decolorize and remove some of the components (including anthraquinone which acts as laxative) as some studies shown to be carcinogenic on rats, but not on mice (see Toxicity). NTP did not conduct studies of the Aloe vera gel (decolorized whole leaf extracts).\n\nAloe vera leaf juice is made by taking entire aloe vera leaves and grinding them up via some type of maceration. Typically some enzymatic treatment is used (such as cellulase) to break down the rind and heavier-weight materials, and then the resulting slurry is filtered, usually with charcoal filtration, to remove any other unwanted materials such as the aloe latex (yellow, bitter tasting exudate that is a powerful laxative). The remainder is aloe vera leaf juice.\n\nAloe vera inner leaf juice\n\nAloe vera inner leaf juice is made by removing the rind prior to processing, either by machine or by hand, and then rinsing away the aloe latex. The remaining, gelatinous inner-leaf material is then ground/crushed into aloe vera inner leaf juice.\n\n\nIn some other countries Aloe vera juice is produced using the patented TTS (Time, Temperature, Sanitation) method.\nOnce Aloe vera gel is filtered out for consumption, then it's considered safe, because without filtration it can be harmful causing potential toxicity when swallowed. \nAloe vera that contains aloin (however it's not for sure) in excess amounts may induce side effects, but there is very little data about what levels of aloin are in most liquid products (according to one research, it's less than 1ppm), however in solid/semi-solid products it could be 10-100 times higher.  If aloin is the cause of the tumors in rats, then the lower the concentration of aloin, then it's less harmful. However more research is needed to answer these questions.\nIs Aloe vera regulated?\nIn US Aloe vera is a dietary supplement and it's not regulated drug, so there is no guarantee of strength, purity, or safety of these products. Currently Aloe vera is approved by FDA as a food addictive for flavor.\nIn the UK, European Union, China, and Korea content and purity of Aloe is regulated by IASC (International Aloe Science Council Seal of Approval) which established standards to define what is (and what is not) \"aloe vera\" in finished products. The IASC standard states that only products containing acemannan, or the beta 1-4 acetylated glucomannans, can be accurately labeled as aloe vera. Acemannan is a naturally occurring polysaccharide that is present in aloe vera and is used as an identifier of the botanical by analytical means. Products that do not contain acemannan are not considered to be true aloe vera based on this standard.\nHow can I tell if a product truly contains Aloe vera?\nIn countries where Aloe vera is regulated, you should check the label for seal-based certification (see: labeling guidance). You may also check the certified products list on IASC website. Also make sure that Aloin content has been removed.\nHealth benefits\nPotential health benefits of drinking Aloe vera juice includes:\n\nsupport the digestive system and relieve constipation,\nFor example mixing Aloe with different oils and lemon juice can reach the entire gastrointestinal track to the colon.

On the other hand, that water may contain flesh eating bacteria.\nThis is a situation of a lesser of two evils. Each wound is different and the causes numerous. The only reason you would need to \"clean\" a wound is if there is something in the wound that presents a hazard. Is that hazard greater then the damage urine will cause it? \nBleeding does not necessarily require cleaning. Bleeding in it's very nature is bleeding out and not in, decreasing the odds of infection.\nUrine is designed to remove waste materials and isn't designed for bacteria. A UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) is normally introduced externally rather then interiorly.\nAs far as sterility goes, completely sterile water is uncommon. I would trust water from my water bottle more then urine, even if it does contain bacteria from my mouth.\n", "nutrition - Why is natural sugar healthier than refined sugar?": "\nTo directly answer your question: it is not.  \"Natural\" sugar is no healthier than \"refined\" sugar, and sugar in fruits is no healthier than sugar in juice.  Sugar molecules are sugar molecules, regardless of whether they are \"natural\" or \"refined.\"  There is no difference.\nHowever, I believe the real question here is why the WHO is recommending one type of food over another, so I'll attempt to address this.\nThe sugar is the same, but (1) the rest of the food that you eat with the sugar is different, so (2) your overall diet is different, (3) which leads to different health effects.\n(1) When you eat refined sugar you are typically not consuming nutrient-dense foods.  A simple example is oranges vs. orange juice.  Have you ever tried to eat three oranges?  It's not easy.  You have to chew a lot of pulp, which fills you up, and later on you may have bowel issues due to the large amount of fiber.  These are natural mechanisms that help to prevent you from over-consuming oranges.  However, if you instead squeeze these oranges, you get a glass of orange juice, which is easy to drink, and due to the lack of pulp it is easy to digest and does not fill you up.\n(2) A healthy diet has carbs, protein, fats, fiber, water, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients, and if you eat a balanced mix of fruits, vegetables, meats, grains, nuts, and/or other \"natural\" foods, you can get a pretty good mix of these.  If you consume a large quantity of refined foods, you'll get a lot of sugar, salt, and fat, but not much else, so you get a lot of calories but don't make much progress in your overall nutrient needs.  This has the dual effects of excess calories and nutrient deficiency.  You're starving (for nutrients) and over-consuming (sugar, salt, and fat) at the same time.\n(3) This unbalanced diet (heavy in sugar) leads to some health effects such as (a) excess weight gain, and (b) decreased insulin sensitivity.\n(3a) Fructose is generally processed by the liver, and it does not trigger the \"fullness\" feeling like glucose and other foods, leading to excess calorie consumption and weight gain.  This extra body fat is associated with negative health effects.\n(3b) Insulin helps regulate blood sugar, but it can lose effectiveness, especially when blood sugar quickly and repeatedly rises to high levels.  This is not just due to sugar, but starch and high glycemic index foods that easily break down into glucose.  The amount matters, too.  It's not just how fast the food gets converted to glucose but how much of it there is.\nTable sugar (sucrose) and corn syrup (including high fructose corn syrup) have both glucose and fructose, so you'll probably see both effects if you include enough refined foods in your diet.\nSo, bottom line: refined foods have the same sugar chemicals, but the overall composition of the foods is skewed away from nutrients and toward sugar, which means the overall diet is out of balance, leading to over-consumption of calories, weight gain, and insulin resistance, which are associated with a number of health problems.\nReferences:\n[1] Maria Gadoy, \"What's More Nutritious, Orange Juice Or An Orange?

Truth be told, though, if there is a single class of drugs that has added more quality-adjusted life-years to human history than any other, steroids must be competing with just a few antibiotic classes for that title.\nTo make clear what we\u2019re talking about, the term \u201csteroid\u201d as a label for drugs generally refers to glucocorticoids (GCs) - drugs that act like cortisol, an endogenous steroid hormone. Commonly used GCs include:\n\nShort acting: hydrocortisone, cortisone\nIntermediate-acting: prednisone, prednisolone, mehthylprednisolone, triamcinolone\nLong-acting: betamethasone, dexamethasone, paramethasone\n\nYour question poses a specific example of one indication for steroids but seems to be asking about the use of these drugs more generally. As others have brought up, any decision about drug treatment involves weighing the risk-benefit ratio.\nBenefits\nAlthough going through the efficacy data for various conditions is beyond the scope of this answer, I list a sampling of the common indications for GC treatment, and in the concluding paragraph I will provide specific efficacy data for arthritis.   \n\nReplacement therapy: due to either primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison\u2019s disease) or secondary/tertiary insufficiency (at the level of the hypothalamus or pituitary.   \nInflammatory conditions (deep breath in): asthma, eczema, inflammatory bowel disease, allergic rhinitis/sinusitis, eosinophilic anything, inflammatory arthritis, anaphylaxis, septic shock (in very specific circumstances), polymyalgia rheumatica, polyarteritis nodosa, temporal arteritis, minimal change glomerulonephritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, urticaria, autoimmune hepatitis\nOther things that aren\u2019t (necessarily) obviously inflammatory: increased intracranial pressure, intractable nausea, acute leukemia, sarcoidosis, cluster headaches, dermatomyositis\n\nRisks\nFirst, please note that a few of the indications for GC require only a very brief burst of high-dose GC. In this time course, these drugs actually very few serious side effects (psychiatric effects and hyperglycemia are exceptions, but rarely outweigh the benefit). Over the longer term, however, supra-physiologic doses of GC have an array of adverse effects that fall into a few categories:\n\nSuppression of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis: Exogenous GCs suppress the hypothalamic pathway that stimulates the adrenal gland, resulting in adrenal atrophy. This means that if the exogenous GC is abruptly discontinued, adrenal crisis can ensue. The rule of thumb I learned was that >3 weeks treatment with  >10 mg prednisone (or equivalent) can cause HPA suppression. As a result, GC treatment that meets these criteria is generally ended with a taper, allowing the adrenal to regenerate, whereupon it can resume normal function.\nThis side effect is usually a non-issue if the medication is tapered correctly. Therefore, the benefits of treatment will generally outweigh the risks.\nCushing\u2019s syndrome: This term is generally applied to the  constellation of symptoms occuring with chronic administration of supra-physiologic doses of GC.  \n\nHyperglycemia   \nHypertension  \nPsychiatric effects: insomnia, precipitation of mania or psychosis in susceptible individuals\nSalt retention1\nDecreased bone mineral density\nWeight gain: generally in a pattern characterized by central adiposity and peripheral muscle atrophy\nIncreased intra-ocular pressure\n\n\nSo, after all that:\n\nWhy do doctors prescribe steroid tablets though they knew the side effect?\n\nBecause the benefit outweighs the risk.2 For the example you gave \u2014 arthritis3 \u2014 the best paper I found was a meta-analysis that used a statistical method that compares the number needed to treat (NNT) with the number needed to harm (NNH) for long-term (>1 year) treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The ratio there NNH/NNT was 0.25, which is considered \u201cgood.\u201d I\u2019ll let you read their methods if you\u2019d like the details. For further reading on this methodology and insights into how we quantitatively assess the comparison between risks and benefits, this article by Guo et al. provides some good bedtime reading.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n1. This is actually a mineralocoricoid rather than a GC effect, only present for those GCs whose receptor specificity overlaps, most prominently the short-acting agents hydrocortisone and cortisone.\n \n\n2. Usually. Steroids are probably over-used in some settings because most people know that steroids tend to \u201cmake everybody feel better.\u201d They can be an easy way to make patients happy if the side effects aren\u2019t fully appreciated. Thus (in case you needed me to tell you!), your question is a valid one.\n\n\n3. I\u2019m assuming here rheumatoid arthritis, because this is the most common type of arthritis for which steroids are appropriate. For the more common osteo-\u201carthritis\u201d \u2014 a.k.a. degenerative joint disease \u2014 I\u2019m sure steroids would make patients feel better, but the benefit there rarely outweighs the risk.\n\n\nReferences:\n \n\nGuo JJ, Pandey S, Doyle J, Bian B, Lis Y, Raisch DW.

If you remove the calluses, then you will need to either wear gloves or other protective gear to prevent them from reforming.\nOnce you have calluses, there are a few ways you can reduce them. It's not recommended to simply cut them off or similar, as the skin underneath will (generally) not be sufficient to protect the area when the stress reoccurs. This can lead to blisters and/or breaks in the skin, which opens up the possibility of infections.\nLotions and soaks such as epsom salts can help soften the area, and then something like a pumice stone can be gently used to abrade away the surface of the callus. Again, do not try to remove the entire area at one time. There are also many home remedies such as soaking in chamomile tea and similar, but I have no experience with their efficacy.\nIf you wish to prevent them in the future, take note of where on your hands they form, and then look for gloves that have padding in those specific areas. Be aware, that even with good gloves, you may still get callus formation.\n", "Does the lack of sleep affect my health?": "\nIn short, and according to the WGBH Educational Foundation and the Harvard Medical School Division of Sleep Medicine:\n\nLack of sleep can, in the short term, \"affect judgment, mood, ability to learn and retain information, and may increase the risk of serious accidents and injury\"\nIn the long term, it may \"lead to a host of health problems including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and even early mortality\".

Since the veins have valves to ensure one-way direction, compression (usage) of the muscles causes it to move up, against gravity.\nLymph also piggybacks on this process to push fluid upwards, otherwise occasionally resulting in edema.\nMovement of blood is incredibly important. It transports white blood cells to fight various infections in your body, platelets have a tendency to start clotting when blood is moving too slow for a extended period of time (however are extremely important in injuries), nutrients are carried from your intestines, oxygen is carried to cells and carbon dioxide is carried away, filtering by the kidney's, etc.\nAnother component is the the body's powerful ability to adapt. It doesn't like spending energy when it doesn't have to. Sitting for extended periods of time frequently means your heart doesn't need to be very strong. Should at some point you do need it to do more (like when you're standing or exercising) it must quickly work overtime to keep up. This invites high blood pressure, dizziness and general fatigue.\nTo push the point, imagine someone who has been bed-ridden for several weeks due to surgery, illness, etc. While in supine (lying on your back) the person may feel fine. However when sitting up the person experiences dizziness, light-headedness and occasionally nausea. Overtime, especially following exercises, the symptoms fade as the body adjusts to being in a sitting position. The same occurs when standing\nWhat to do\nThe solution is simple. Move. Work out so that periods of inactivity are the exception and not the norm. A strong heart can handle higher level exercises and inactivity. A weak heart will have trouble with the former.\nAlso, it's the inactivity with sitting that is unhealthy. You can stand and be inactive just as well (standing desk). \n@kevin\n\nI have heard people who, after a long flight, fainted as they get up after landing.\n\nThe blood vessels constantly vaso dilate (get wider) and vaso constrict as needed.\nFollowing a nights sleep, you may feel dizzy if you quickly stand up. This is because over the course of the night you were likely sitting in supine. Since only minimal pressure is needed to maintain flow in supine, the vessels can vaso dilate. \nUpon standing or sitting, the situation changes quickly and the body is not quick enough to respond. Since the body cannot get blood to the highest point (brain) fast enough, it cannot function. Luckily, when people faint they go into a horizontal posture, rapidly providing blood to the brain again.\nThe above invites trauma of course, but the risk of trauma is less of a issue then the lack of nutrients to the brain.\n", "optometry - Is eye patching effective for older children with amblyopia?": "\nSome studies have shown that eye patching has been effective in adults.

This process involves keeping the eye open, and making an incision across the protective cornea tissue to form a flap. This is achieved via a suction ring. The flap is then lifted back (note that it is still connected to the rest of the eye). Lasers are then used to reshape the cornea tissue to remove the defects. The flap is pulled back over the cornea tissue and left to heal.\nThe laser used operates using rapid pulses of low-energy-level ultraviolet light. The are other forms of eye surgery other than LASIK, but they depend more on the patients individual eye issues.\nThese links from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration shows the processes involved.\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/surgery-devices/lasik (with a video explaining the risks)\nhttps://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/lasik/lasik-faqs-frequently-asked-questions\n\n", "terminology - What is the difference between sinew and tendon?": "\nThey get used somewhat interchangeably, which blurs the lines on the definitions.\nWhen I had my anatomy classes, sinews were regarded as an inclusive class, which included both ligaments and tendons.\nFor the breakdown:\n\nTendon: Fibrous tissue that connects muscle to bone.\nLigament: Fibrous tissue that connects bone to bone.\nSinew: Includes both of the above.\n\n", "nutrition - Are dairy products effective sources of calcium?": "\nDairy products are not the best source of calcium for many reasons.\n\nLactose Intolerance\n\nLactose intolerant people can't have dairy products as they will usually cause various symptoms like diarrhea or cramping\n\nHigh Saturated Fat Content\n\nMost dairy products are high in saturated fat, which can be a risk factor for heart disease\nMilk has been able to cut down on this with reduced fat and fat-free options, but other dairy products, like cheese and ice cream are still very high in fat\n\nCancer Risk\n\nOvarian Cancer - Studies have shown that high intakes of lactose (equal to 2-3 servings of milk) can increase the risk of ovarian cancer1\nProstate Cancer - Studies showed inconclusive evidence that some men with a higher calcium intake might have a higher risk of prostate cancer; Evidence was not conclusive; Could also be linked to just calcium rather than dairy products2\n\n\nThough dairy products are a convenient source, and they are high in protein and vitamins A and D, they are not the best source for calcium.

CO2 tension is a byproduct of food metabolism, and in high amounts can cause dyspnea, acidosis and possibly altered consciousness. The findings showed that standing, then sitting, then lying each produced higher CO2 tension than the previous position. Trendelenburg (Lying with head lower than legs) produced less than lying, approximating the sitting position. Sitting erect also had lower tension than sitting reclined.\nMore anecdotally, this website posting looks at the traditional Indian position of sitting on the floor while eating, which promotes a more erect sitting stance than sitting on a chair/couch or reclining while eating. While not backed up with studies, it also claims that the vagus nerve response is enhanced in this position, resulting in quicker time to satiety (You eat less as a result). Many Middle Eastern cultures eat this way, as do more traditional Asian homes where the seats are merely cushions on a floor around a short table. There are many other benefits listed in the article, but for brevity and provability I won't cite them all here.\nI also ran across references (But was unable to find the actual study) to a 2007 study involving women published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, that found people standing up tended to pay less attention to the food, and as a result ate faster and more. It's fairly well established that the vagus nerve response to feel full is in the neighborhood of 20 minutes to take effect, so if you eat slower (as promoted by sitting down) you will also tend to eat less overall. It's also been shown that eating without distractions such as television and reading promotes lower consumption overall.\nSo in effect, it appears that sitting in an erect position is possibly the best happy medium, and if possible, eating without distractions to be able to concentrate on the food. Especially if you suffer from acid upsets or other related ailments, the more erect you are the more you may ease your symptoms.\n", "Legal issues when using first aid techniques that require certification in foreign countries": "\nIt does differ from country to country. For example, in France (As I'm sure you are aware), if a person fails to render assistance to a person in danger then they can by held liable. This falls under the \"duty to rescue\" concept.\nHere in the United States (and elsewhere), this is covered by something called the \"Good Samaritan Law\", which is intended to remove the fear of litigation preventing someone from aiding another in times of distress.\nHowever, it is not a blanket immunity from someone suing. One of the concepts that I was taught when I was a first responder and ER medic in the Armed Forces, is that you are pretty much safe if you act in a manner consistent with either your own training or the training of the general person on the street.\nWhile it is not a guarantee, if you stick within the scope of your training and provide assistance, then you should pretty much be protected. You may still be sued, as there is no bar against a lawsuit being brought, but the Samaritan concept should protect you.\nNote, this is not something that covers everything. For example, I was trained and certified in starting IV fluids. US protocol, however, provides that this can only be done when there is contact with a medical control available, and transport to a facility. If I came upon a hiking accident and whipped out an IV, I could still be held liable since that is out of protocol, and I would be considered to be acting outside the scope of common practice.\nIf you are traveling, your best bet is to look up the laws of emergency responders in the country you are going to. In some countries if it becomes known that you have the certification and you passed by an accident, you can then be held liable and possibly removed from certification because you failed in your duty to act.\n", "medications - Crohn's disease and naproxen": "\nFrom the World Journal of Gastroenterology, a 2006 submission on Excerabation of IBD by NSAIDS and cox-2 inhibitors: Fact or Fiction, found a weak link between NSAIDs and a IBD flare but some patients will experience a flare up on the medication.

Most side effects are temporary, but skin atrophy and depigmentation can be permanent.\nIn a further study published in 2002 in Foot and Ankle Clinics we read:\n\nIntimidation with adverse effects of peritendinous corticosteroid injections is based on case reports only rather than convincing data from controlled clinical studies.\nAlthough a complete tendon rupture with loading after steroid injection has been reported, no reliable proof exists of the deleterious effects of peritendinous injections; conclusions in literature are based mainly on uncontrolled case reports that fail under scientific scrutiny, whereas scientifically rigorous studies have not been performed.\nAlthough corticosteroid injections are one of the most commonly used treatment modalities for chronic tendon disorders, there is an obvious lack of good trials defining the indications for and efficacy of such injections, and subsequently, many of the recommendations for the use of local corticosteroid injections do not rely on sound scientific basis. Thus, there is an obvious need for high-quality basic science studies and controlled clinical trials in examining the effects corticosteroids on various tendon disorders.\n\nBased on above studies, the effect of local corticosteroid injection(s) for tendon disorders is unknown. The extent of the tendon problem, the duration of the symptoms, and the phase of healing at the time of injection are factors that may modify the efficacy and side effect profile of this procedure. More studies need to be conducted to determine how these factors influence outcomes.\nNHS has provided the following advice about corticosteroid injections:\n\nCorticosteroids can be injected around injured tendons to reduce pain\nand inflammation.\nWhile these injections can help reduce pain, they aren't effective for\neveryone and the effect sometimes only lasts a few weeks.\nThe injections can be repeated if they help, but a gap of at least six\nweeks between treatments, and a maximum of three injections into one\narea, is usually recommended because frequent injections can cause\nside effects.

Other times, the mole cells will be deeper in your skin, so the doctor will have to make a deeper cut to prevent it from coming back (like taking a weed out by its roots). The deeper cuts will usually require stitches. This process is called 'excision'.\nIn cases where the mole is suspected to be cancerous, this is always the method used - usually a full excision is performed to make sure no potentially-cancerous cells are left behind.\nFreezing it off with liquid nitrogen\nA small amount of liquid nitrogen (which is extremely cold) will be placed on the mole. A small blister might form, but it will heal by itself.\nBurning it off\nAn electric current is passed through a wire which will burn off the upper layers of the skin (where the mole is) off. Can require multiple treatments.\n\nWebMD - Removing Moles and Skin Tags\nHow Do Doctors Remove Moles?\n", "cryotherapy - Why does icing work best when applied shortly after tendinitis symptoms appear?": "\nWe ice injuries like tendinitis because they reduce the pain and inflammation. Ice does not actually fix your tendinitis, it just makes it easier to deal with. The reason it is recommended that you ice immediately after you see symptoms of tendinitis is so you can relieve the pain quicker. Icing after a few days will probably be little less effective (the tendon will have also healed a bit naturally, so the difference will be less), but if you can get rid of the pain and reduce the inflammation earlier, why wouldn't you?

Spicy foods help to raise your metabolic rate, which will slow down your weight gain. If you eat spicy foods often, the effects add up.1\nA 2007 study by Nottingham University2 found that spicy foods can help kill cancer cells. Capsaicin, which is what makes many foods spicy, attacks the mitochondria of the cancer cells, triggering their death. \nSpicy foods have also been found to help decongest your sinuses. A 1998 study3 found that a capsaicin nasal spray helped to clear the sinuses of people. Eating spicy foods has been known to have a similar effect.4\n\nNow for some risks of eating spicy food.\nWhen you are eating spicy foods, there are only a few risks to watch out for. Spicy foods have been known as foods that can trigger heartburn, so anyone with heartburn should avoid them.5 Some spicy foods that don't contain capsaicin, like horseradish, can sometimes damage tissue.6\nThere are usually more risks when handling spicy foods, especially peppers. If pepper juice gets in your eye, it will cause pain and possibly swelling. If this ever happens, there are ways to flush out your eyes.7 Handling peppers and sometimes horseradish before eating can cause pain, swelling, redness, and irritation in your hand.

As otherwise mentioned, marathoners do consume food. But it's unlikely they will eat complex foods like fat or protein and go straight to simple foods like carbohydrates since it is easier for the body to break it down. Despite simple foods, energy must be used to digest so it makes exercising harder. But the benefit of the energy is more quickly greater then not consuming it. Consuming too much can override this though. 1 There aren't any long term marathoners I know of that eat a thanksgiving dinner prior and expect to make it very far.\n", "Causes of hypertension in young, healthy patient?": "\nProbably some of the more common causes would be poor diet and lack exercise. Not everyone who eats poorly and doesn't exercise will be over weight since genetics plays a role. That is, a young adult can appear to be healthy but be internally suffering. Another question would be is this otherwise health individual a smoker?\n\nTwo recent studies confirm the blood pressure benefits of maintaining a healthy diet. First is the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) clinical study, which tested the effects of food nutrients on blood pressure. It emphasizes consumption of fruits, vegetables, and lowfat dairy foods, whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts, and stresses reduction of fats, red meats, sweets, and sugared beverages.\nSecond is the DASH-sodium study, which demonstrates the importance of lowering sodium (salt) intake. Most Americans consume far more than the current, daily recommendation of 2,400 milligrams (mg) of sodium\u2014about a teaspoon of table salt\u2014or less. This includes all salt and sodium consumed, not just at the table, but also in cooking. For those with high blood pressure, consuming even less may be advisable, since the DASH-sodium study revealed that diets containing no more than 1,500 mg of sodium per day had still greater pressure-lowering effects.\nRegular physical activity is another good step toward controlling or even preventing high blood pressure. Start with 30 minutes of moderate-level activity, such as brisk walking, bicycling or gardening on most\u2014preferably all\u2014days of the week. The activity even may be divided into three, 10-minute periods each. For added benefit, these moderate half-hours may be increased or supplanted by regular, vigorous exercise. Of course, prior to upping the activity level, people should check with their physicians, especially if they have had heart trouble or a previous heart attack, a family history of heart disease at an early age, or other serious health problems.\nAnother healthy move is to limit alcohol intake. Excess alcohol can raise blood pressure as well as damage the liver, heart, and brain. Drinks should be kept to a maximum of one per day for women, and two for men. (One drink equals 12 ounces of beer or five ounces of wine.)\nFinally, quit smoking. Among other things, smoking damages blood vessel walls and speeds hardening of the arteries. Ceasing smoking reduces the risk of heart attack in just one year [1].\n\nI would say this would probably be the most common causes of a young, health adult presenting with asymptomatic hypertension; however, there can be other reasons as well. For instance, another cause could be paraganglioma. The NIH presented a case of a 19 year old female with asymptomatic severe hypertension in 2010. The woman had a BP of 220/140 mmHg. Her lab results showed elevated plasma norepinephrine, 1807 pg/ml, and 24h urinary free catecholamines, 483 ug/24h. After resection of the tumor, the patients BP was normal during followup.

This may also relate to persistent or recurrent shoulder pain or weakness (due to subscapularis tension or laxity) which may be indirectly associated with the extraction site and an indicator of a heart issue.\nTraditional Asian medicine has long maintained that every body part (ie: organs, tissues, glands, etc) is animated by a specific acupuncture meridians (pathways).

They're naturally occurring molecules in vegetables.\nSeveral foods are sources of nitrates (salts) which are a normal part of the diet as they occur naturally and they're produced by a number of species of nitrifying bacteria. Only excessive levels can cause any health problems (methemoglobinemia).\nSodium nitrite and potassium nitrite (salts) are added to cured and processed meats as reducing agent (opposite of oxidation agent) to delay spoilage and pathogenic bacteria growth and to preserve its color.\nHistorically nitrite and nitrate were considered harmful food additives where they were considered carcinogenic, however recent research has change our ideas about health effects of both nitrite and nitrate and newly studies show no association between its intake and stomach or ovarian cancer. Further more, they're now considered as essential nutrients for cardiovascular health by promoting nitric oxide (NO) production.2010, 2012\nHowever under certain conditions, nitrite can form nitrosamines, molecules that cause cancer in lab animals.

As the result the U.S. Department of Agriculture established the safety limits on the amount of nitrites used in meat products in order to decrease cancer risk in the population. This could indicate that nitrosamines may be carcinogenic in humans.\nAlthough available evidence supports a positive association between nitrite and nitrosamine intake and gastric cancer (GC) and oesophageal cancer (OC), they're not conclusive2006, wiki.\nThe recent research suggests that nitrite preservatives have \"been found to be safe\"2012.

In order to endure in work, in hobbies, in exercise and in day to day living does not rewuire added sugar in a diet. They are bad.\nRemoving carbohydrates from your diet may have some negative impact but not necessarily. Classic low carb diets recommend to remove all substances with a high glycemic index (GI) from your diet. The higher the GI, the faster your blood glucose level will rise when digesting the food. White bread or white rice are examples of foods with a high GI value. In the very extreme, a low carb diet may result in ketosis, which means that your body will get slightly acidic and all your energy consumption is due to burning fat. Removing all carbohydrates stops the citric acid cycle inside cells and this results in the formation of ketone substances which are acidic.\nKetosis may improve your weight loss by burning fat more efficiently. However there are considerable between-subject variations in this. Low carb diets and subsequent ketosis may result in nausea, headaches and general illness. Not all people  tolerate low carb diets or ketosis.\nIf you perform long duration exercises I can\u00b4t recommend removing high GI  substances from your diet. Skeletal muscles need a lot of energy  while doing long duration exercises. The most important energy storage is muscle glycogen. This is consumed in long duration exercises, and after it runs out the body starts to use fats and proteins. Foods with a high GI value are important to restore your muscle glycogen storages after exercise. Therefore removing, say, white rice from your diet won\u00b4t be good for exercise if they are usually long duration. Interval or strength training is a different issue. It is also important to note that even a long day at work may be similar to long duration exercise. How well your body does tolerate the lack of your muscle glycogen, is very depending on your general health and fitness.\n", "weight - Is there an optimal body fat percentage?": "\nCurrently I am not aware of any scientifically based recommendations for levels of healthy body fat. There are empirical observations and actuarial tables/considerations, but there hasn't been a definitive \"For a 30 year old Caucasian male, 8-15% body fat is ideal for health\" studies out yet.\nThere was a study in 2000 that was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition that attempted to lay some groundwork for this kind of evaluation, and they came up with some interesting formulae for body fat assessment, but it was left as very open ended and needing much more study.\nThere is a chart available through the American Council on Exercise (ACE) that shows levels of fat for various categories of men and women, but it makes no distinction on age, merely on activity level.\n\nAnother pair of charts from Accufitness (Makers of body fat calipers) I like better, as it accounts for both age and sex, but makes no allowances for activity level.\n\n\nIf you look at BMI charts, anything below 18.5 is considered unhealthy, and anything over 25-30 (depending on chart) is trending towards the obese range. These are more statistical/actuarial tables than anything, however and have been around (largely unchanged) since inception in the early/mid 1800's.\nAs far as the measurement, there are three different types of fat, subcutaneous (under the skin), visceral (Around body organs) and intramuscular (In the muscles, like marbling on a steak). Bioelectric impedance (Such as the scale you mention) work by passing a low electric current through the body and measuring the resistance. These can have a +/- accuracy range of 3-10% depending on the model, and can be affected by hydration, time of day, wet skin, and other factors.\nSkin calipers done by an experienced practitioner can have a variance as low as 3%, underwater weighing (Again done properly) can get below 3%, and the gold standard is a DXA scan that measures everything from bone density to total fat.\nSo far everyone agrees that too low or too high a weight is bad and carries risk of injury/illness/disease, but we haven't agreed yet on what is good for which population cohort.\n", "dermatology - Rashes on back of knees": "\nFrom the picture and the symptoms you mentioned, especially the itchiness, it seems that you are right about it being that being eczema. Also, eczema is common behind the knees. From that picture though, it does not seem like that eczema is very bad. There are a lot of worse cases. Though there is still some dispute in the medical world, one study1 says that the cause of eczema is a bacteria that lives on the skin. This bacteria blocks the sweat ducts, which causes a reaction in the immune system that causes irritation, itchiness, and rashes.\nWebMD2 says that it is likely that the immune system causes the reaction, but they also provide some other possible causes, such as genetics (eczema is usually common in families), certains environments you may be, and skin irritants like chlorine, makeup, and even some soaps and cleansers. It is likely that these skin irritants cause the bacteria mentioned above to react, which in turn cause the immune system to create rashes and irritation on certain parts of the skin.\nTips for treating eczema\nOther than drugs that can be prescribed by your doctor, there are a few things you can do to help treat eczema.\n\nUse more mild soap - some soaps can cause dry skin; these are the types of soap that tend to irritate eczema; try to get soaps that won't make your skin dry (usually your doctor can recommend a brand)\n\nShowering - taking long, hot showers can also cause your skin to dry up; instead take shorter, warm (not hot) showers\n\nReduce stress - stress can be a factor for an irritation in your body; just relax sometimes; also, try to get more sleep\n\nPetroleum jelly - using petroleum jelly on the spot of the eczema can help relieve the need to scratch\n\nMoisturize your skin - dry skin is a side effect of eczema, so moisturizing your skin is important\n\n\n\n[1]  National Eczema Association - Study Reveals the Cause of Eczema\n[2]  WebMD - Eczema Health Center\n", "allergy - Do Benadryl and Loratadine contain the same active ingredient?": "\nNo, they do not contain the same active ingredient. Benadryl (trade name) is also known as diphenhydramine (generic name); loratidine (generic name) is also known as Claritin (trade name). Both drugs are primarily antihistamines and primarily active antagonists at the H1 subtype of histamine receptor. It is this property that makes them effective for treatment of allergies. \nThe difference between the two medications is that diphenhydramine is a first generation or \u201cnon-selective\u201d antihistamine. The term \u201cnon-selective\u201d refers to these drugs' activity at a variety of receptors other than H1 - primarily, acetylcholine receptors. This can lead to more anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth, urinary retention, etc. First generation antihistamines are also highly lipophilic, which means they cross the blood-brain barrier and have central nervous system activity. It is this property which makes them quite sedating (primarily due to activity at CNS histamine receptors).\nSecond generation antihistamines were designed to avoid some of the side effects of first generation agents. They are more specific for the H1 receptor and are mostly lipophobic, meaning they poorly penetrate the blood-brain barrier, resulting in fewer CNS effects. For more information about antihistamines, this Drug Class Review is quite informative. \nIs one better than the other for hay fever? \nProbably not. It\u2019s just a matter of dose that determines how much anti-histamine activity each provides. The trouble is that many people will find the side effects of diphenhydramine and other non-selective agents to be dose-limiting, in which case practically it may not be as effective.\nShould they be taken together (staggered or otherwise)?\nI see no clear benefit to this. Again, their activity against hay fever is mediated by the same receptor. As such, they will just have additive effects. Taking twice as much of one or the other would similarly increase activity against hay fever and/or to contribute to untoward side effects. So it\u2019s \u201cOK\u201d to take them together in the same way that it\u2019s \u201cOK\u201d to take twice as much of either one. \nIn general, I see little reason to use diphenhydramine for allergic indications unless there is a desire for the sedative properties. Loratadine and other second generation agents have overtaken it in usefulness in this area.\n", "first aid - Would butter on burns help or harm?": "\nShort anwser: Never put butter, oil, etc, on a burn.  This would worsen the burn.\nPutting butter, oil, or anything else would trap heat and make the burn deeper. It would also make further treatment harder and would make the risk of infection higher:\n\nDon\u2019t apply burn ointments. Like butter (or mayonnaise), these ointments, usually oil-based, won\u2019t relieve pain but instead will trap heat, slow down healing, and increase the risk of infection.\n\nWhat to do instead: Once it happens, a burn is actually \"cooking inside\", and this for a while after the exposure, so the first thing to do is to stop this internal reaction using flowing water.\nAccording to official guidelines for general public in France (page 12-14), and sticking to thermal burns here (not chemical nor electrical), you should:\n\nQuickly water the burn \n\nAct right after the burn if safely possible. (You are not supposed to put yourself in danger to save someone: this is the best way to end up with two victims instead of one)\nPut the burn under flowing water, between 15 and 25\u00b0 Celsius. The tap is fine to to that, just keep in mind to keep the water pressure low enough not to press the burn.\nWhile watering, remove the clothes of the victim unless they adhere to the burn (should they adhere, don't pull on clothes).\n\nEvaluate the burn\n\nNo blister or blister smaller that 1/2 of the victim's palm ; far from natural orifices ; not on the neck, face or joints ; just red, not black and white: this is a minor burn\nAny burn that does not match the criteria above, or any large red area on a children, is a major burn\n\nShould it be a minor burn\n\nKeep on watering as long as the burn hurts and the victim doesn't feel cold. Not just a couple of seconds: 5 or 10 minutes is not surprising, it's actually fine. Watering is what prevents (more) blisters from appearing later on.\nDepending on the pain, aspect and victim's age: watch over the burn or ask a doctor or a physician. \nDon't pierce blisters should there be any. Cover them with a sterile plaster. \nShould blisters, fever, heat, pain, etc, appear later on, ask for medical advice.\n\nShould it be a major burn \n\nCall the medical emergency services, and, without hurrying (very important! Being calm is gaining time.)\n\nTell your name, phone number, current location,\nTell this is for a burn, and tell the victim's gender and age\nDescribe the result of the evaluation you made. \nThey will guide you in accordance to the protocols applicable in your country. This guidance will certainly include watering, covering the victim if he/she feels cold...)\nDo NOT hang up the phone before they tell you to do so\n\nKeep on watering as instructed by the medical assistance.\nMake the victim to lie down in a way he/she cannot fall (floor, bed...). Sitting down is OK the victim has difficulties to breathe. The victim should NOT sit on a chair but on the ground to prevent him/her from falling. \nProtect the victim with a clean linen. The burnt body parts should remain visible.\nWatch over the victim until the arrival of the ambulance.\n\n\n", "cryotherapy - Does ice pack therapy have any healing effect for a tendinopathy?": "\nAs I mentioned in this answer, icing is not meant to heal tendinopathy. It is supposed to be a painkiller. It can have some effects that may feel like they are fixing the problem though. The cold ice forces blood vessels to contract which can help reduce the inflammation. This might be considered healing, but the tendinopathy is still there, until the tendon heals itself.\n", "feet - What causes body parts to fall asleep?": "\nParesthesia can be caused by inactivity, sustained pressure on the nerve, neurological disorder, or nerve damage. \nIf the causes is from pressure, the user V_ix on Biology gave the following answer here which I have quoted:\n\nUnderneath the superficial layers of your skin there are receptors which sense pressure, temperature and pain. These receptors are part of the peripheral nervous system which senses stimuli and they take the message conveying details about the stimulus to the somatosensory cortex of the brain. Here is where the perception of pain, burning, pressure etc is ultimately made. To take the simplest example, if you stop blood flow for a short amount of time in a limb, these receptors are activated, and will send signals to the brain that are interpreted as tingling or numbness. With more severe pain, different receptors are activated which , again, project to the same brain area but a different message is read out. If the pressure from one limb is removed, the receptors will go back to normal function as blood flow is restored.\n\nIf what you experience is chronic, you may need to see your healthcare provider in order to rule out a neurological disorder or nerve damage. You can find more information on paresthesia from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke as well as clinical trials if you are really concerned about this on their site:\n\nhttp://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/paresthesia/paresthesia.htm\n\n", "What can cause right lower quadrant abdominal pain?": "\nRight lower quadrant pain is typically appendiceal or ovarian.

The main treatments used by doctors are either restoring the skin to normal color, or bleaching the skin, so that all of the skin is an even color. They do these things in a number of ways, including topical treatments and some surgical treatments.1\nThere still might be some side-effects, though. Some people might suffer from psychological distress, but as you said, that doesn't affect you. There is also an increased risk for sunburn and even skin cancer when exposed to the sun. Vitiligo can also cause inflammation of the iris, causing you to have eye problems. There is also a chance of hearing problems. Lastly, as a side-effect of any treatments you might be receiving, you may get dry skin and feel itchy.2\nTo help prevent these side-effects (besides the last one) there are many things you can do other than getting treatments. The most important thing is to protect yourself from UV light. It is recommended that you use sunscreen with at least 30 SPF(Sun Protection Factor). Try to be in the shade whenever possible and wear clothing that will protect your skin from the sun (ie: long sleeve shirts, pants, hats, etc.). Covering up will help with most side-effects, especially the sunburn and the skin cancer, which you are a higher risk for than eye or hearing problems. Also, never get a tattoo. Getting a tattoo will cause more damage to your skin, which can make more patches of vitiligo to appear on your skin.3\n\n[1] Vitiligo Treatments\n\n[2] Mayo Clinic - Vitiligo Complications\n[3] Mayo Clinic - Vitiligo Lifestyle and Home Remedies\n", "emergency - What's the rush in the case of sudden hearing loss?": "\nThe reason why you should see a doctor right away is because some causes of sudden hearing loss need to be treated right away.

It will say \"Serving Size {x} \" where x is the amount of whatever measurement is used. It may also give the amount of another measurement (usually grams) and sometimes even amount of how many of the product is one serving size (chip bags usually do this). Using the amount of servings that you eat, you can use simple math to determine how much of each nutrient/vitamin you have, this also includes the daily value percentage.\nUnder the serving size, there will be the amount of calories and the amount of calories from fat. The calories shown are the calories per serving, so if you eat two servings, then you can double the amount of calories. You can compare the calories that you eat to the daily amount you are supposed to have.\nGeneral rules for calories (based on a 2000 calorie diet)\n\n40 calories or less - low\nAround 100 calories - moderate\n400 calories or more - high\n\nCalories from fat are just the amount of calories that come from fat in the product. Calories are important because eating too many calories is linked to obesity.\nNutrients\nThe next section (under calories) on the food label is about the nutrients in the food. There are two subsections in this section, nutrients to limit and nutrients to get enough of.\nNutrients to Limit\n\nTotal Fat - under it there will also be trans and saturated fat\nCholesterol\nSodium\n\nThese nutrients have been shown to increased risks some cancers, heart disease, and high blood pressure.\nNutrients to get Enough of\n\nDietary Fiber - under Total Carbohydrates\nVitamins A and C\nCalcium\nIron\n\nGetting more of these has been shown to reduce the risk of many of the diseases and problems mentioned, but you shouldn't have too many of these.\nOther nutrients\n\nTotal Carbohydrates - sugar is under this\nProtein\n\nThese foods are neutral-ish, but there are some risks in having too much (over the limit) of these. In fact, too much sugar has been shown to increase the risk of diabetes.1\nReading the numbers\nThe nutrients to limit usually have both an actual amount and a daily value percentage (%DV) based on a 2000 calories diet. The nutrient to get enough of usually don't.\nGuide to %DV\n\n5% or less - low\n20% or more - high; most products won't have anything higher than 20%\n\nIf you have something that has 20%DV of vitamin A, then there will 80%DV of vitamin A left. You could eat 4 more products with 20%DV of vitamin A or some other combination that equals 80%DV.\nFootnote\nThere will three columns, one with the daily recommended amount for a 2000 calories diet and one for a 2500 calorie diet. All of the %DV are based on the 2000 calorie diet, but you can easily convert the percentages to the 2500 calorie diet if you have a calculator (or you can do them by hand). The one column I didn't mention is the calories column. If it says \"Less than\" then you should have less than the amount said in the column of the diet you are on.\nUsually \"Total Fat\", \"Sat Fat\", \"Cholesterol\", and \"Sodium\" will have a \"Less than\" next to them, so you should have less of these than the amount to the right says. \"Total Carbohydrates\" and under it \"Dietary Fiber\" will usually have nothing next to them, so you should get the recommended value to the right.\n\nReading an ingredient list\nThis is a bit trickier than reading the actual label, but the ingredients should be put in order of quantity. There isn't any definite way to see the exact amount of each ingredient in the product, though. It is better to rely on the amount of each nutrient instead of trying to guess how much of each ingredient there is. If you just want to know what you are eating, then there are some good tricks.\n\nSugar has many names - high-fructose corn syrup or corn syrup, agave nectar, barley malt syrup, dehydrated cane juice\nSodium does too - salt, sodium benzoate, disodium, monosodium glutamate\nTrans fat - not listed as an ingredient, but it is in hydrogenated oil which is a common ingredient\n\n\n[1] Is there evidence that eating too much sugar can increase the risk of diabetes?\nHow to Understand and Use the Nutrition Facts Label\nUnderstanding Ingredients on Food Labels\n", "nutrition - What do the European reference intake values used for food labels actually mean?": "\nIn this case 8400 kJ or 2000 kcal indicates the amount energy what an AVERAGE weighing human doing AVERAGE amount of work per day needs to meet his/her basal metabolic rate. As so when daily input of energy is 8400 kJ / 2000 kcal this AVERAGE (wo)man neither gains or loses weight.\nThere are so many factors influencing this basal metabolic rate that I wont dig in to those. Basically these reference values are VERY vague, since same reference dont apply to man weighing 200kg, doing hard manual labor compared to 45kg weighing woman doing nothing demanding work. But naturally byrocrats need some reference values to be able give some guidelines what food should be offered to students in schools and old people in retirement homes.\nEach domain of this reference intake is then calculated or defined against current evidence in literature. Humans need salt, but salt intake of >6g is known to cause CV diseases and hypertension (Evidence for Nutrition Actions). Human needs fat but excessive amount of especially saturated fats leads to heart disease and high cholesterol (Cochrane Heart Group) . Too much protein can affect kidney function in population level (EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies). Then the remaining energy intake should come from carbohydrates, maily food substances with low glygemic index (J Am Heart Assoc.\n2012,Diabetes Care November 2004) . \nSo these values are not maximum, they are not minimum but they give the RATIO how you should eat carbohydrates, fat and protein in order to avoid life-style related diseases. The more you weigh, the more you need energy. The harder you work the more you need energy. The more you do strength trainig the more you need proteins. The more you do long duration exercises the more you need carbohydrates.\n", "aging - Why do tendons become less flexible with age?": "\nAs you grow older, your tendons become more rigid and brittle. This is probably because of decrease in the water content of tendons, which is one of the reasons why tendons are flexible. This decrease in water content makes your tendons stiffer and weaker. They also become less tolerable of stress. This causes you to be more prone to tendon injuries, which can then lead to tendinitis.\n\nEffects of Aging\nEffects of Aging on the Musculoskeletal System\n", "bacteria - Do all hand sanitizers contribute to antibacterial resistance?": "\nThe safest hand sanitizer from the perspective of reducing antibiotic resistance is the alcohol-based sanitizer. It's effective against a wide variety of microorganisms.\nRemember, though, that hand sanitizers don't remove dirt and chemicals from your skin, and all of the ingredients in hand sanitizers are left to fully absorb into your skin. Alcohol makes the skin a bit more permeable to chemicals, so the current recommendation in hospital workers is to wash with soap and water after a few uses of hand sanitizer. (See the first reference for the rest of us.)\nHand sanitizers should primarily be used only as an optional follow-up to traditional hand washing with soap and water, except in situations where soap and water are not available. In those instances, use of an alcohol-based sanitizer is better than nothing at all. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer are about equal in their ability to remove or kill germs on hands, shown in many studies including one small one involving influenza:\n\nHand hygiene with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub is highly effective in reducing influenza A virus on human hands, although soap and water is the most effective intervention.\n\nSoap and water eliminated more virus than the three alcohol-based hand rubs, although the difference between these strategies was not great.\nWhile in theory this remains possible, research so far has not found evidence that use of triclosan leads to bacterial resistance.\n\nThe [FDA] said there is no evidence to date suggesting that triclosan is hazardous to humans, but several studies have found that triclosan can contribute to the development of bacterial resistance (Aiello AE et al. Clin Infect Dis. 2007;45[suppl 2]:S137-S147). In addition, animal studies have found that the chemical can interfere with thyroid function (Paul KB et al. Toxicol Sci. 2010;113[2]:367-379).\n\nPediatricians are recommending that it be avoided in homes with children. It has become almost ubiquitous in the environment, so it should probably be avoided in hand-cleansers, as most of it ends up not on out hands, but in our water supply, etc.\nThe evidence is a only a bit clearer for quaternary ammonium compounds (such as benzalkonium chloride) because of a bacterial genetic element called an integron:\n\nIn recent decades, various genetic mechanisms involved in the spread of resistance genes among bacteria have been identified. Integrons \u2013 genetic elements that acquire, exchange, and express genes embedded within gene cassettes (GC) \u2013 are one of these mechanisms. ...Initially studied mainly in the clinical setting for their involvement in antibiotic resistance, their role in the environment is now an increasing focus of attention.\n\nThere is some evidence that QAC's may cause a selection pressure for bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance integrons:\n\nClass 1 integrons are genetic elements that carry antibiotic and quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) resistance genes that confer resistance to detergents and biocides. ...We show that prevalence of class 1 integrons is higher in bacteria exposed to detergents and/or antibiotic residues...\nResistance toward QACs is widespread among a diverse range of microorganisms... Development of resistance in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria has been related to application in human medicine and the food industry. QACs in cosmetic products will inevitably come into intimate contact with the skin or mucosal linings in the mouth and thus are likely to add to the selection pressure toward more QAC-resistant microorganisms among the skin or mouth flora.\n\nHand Hygiene and Hand Sanitizers good overview\nIntegron Involvement in Environmental Spread of Antibiotic Resistance\nImpacts of anthropogenic activity on the ecology of class 1 integrons and integron-associated genes in the environment\nEfficacy of Soap and Water and Alcohol-Based Hand-Rub Preparations against Live H1N1 Influenza Virus on the Hands of Human Volunteers\nDoes the wide use of quaternary ammonium compounds enhance the selection and spread of antimicrobial resistance and thus threaten our health?\n", "nutrition - How much coffee can a healthy adult drink?": "\nThere are many factors in determining how much coffee one can drink in a day. Caffeine metabolism1 is a big one. People who metabolize caffeine slow, probably shouldn't have more than 100mg of caffeine (about a cup) a day. Fast metabolizers of caffeine can usually have between 400-500mg (about 5 cups) a day.2 For the general population, 400mg (about 4 cups) should be the limit. Going over this may cause several side effects such as insomnia, restlessness, headaches, and upset stomach.3 It usually isn't very hard to know your limit of drinking coffee. If coffee has a strong effect on you right away, drink less coffee, or consider drinking tea. If coffee has a weak effect on you, then you can drink more.

In the ones with identifiable causes, they may be\nRespiratory infections (bacterial and viral)\nAllergy\nToxins\nNon adherenace to medications. \n\nWhen I read through the technique you were talking about, I found that there is no such risk factors in that technique. However, you should take the following precautions:\n\nAvoid this exercise when you have an active acute exacerbation of the disease. Fast breathing causes airways to collapse by Bernoulli's principle, and hence you will have more difficulty breathing. Even though it can potentially clear your airway, it is better avoided at that times.\nMake sure that you sit in a place with clean air when you do this exercise. You don't want allergens, toxins or even pathogens in the air entering your lungs when you are breathing like that.\nNo cold exposure. Cold exposure can trigger a vasovagal attack and can cause constriction of airways. This can even precipitate an acute attack. So a big no no to that. \nEven though it is a no brainer, it is important that you monitor yourself all the time. If you feel not so good, stop immediately. \n\nOther than that, it is generally considered a safe practice to do breathing exercises, and are sometimes adviced to patients of bronchitis. If you follow these precautions, you should be fine. \n", "hearing - When does the use of headphones become harmful?": "\nUsing headphones at a sufficiently high volume level may cause cause trauma to cochlear structure in the inner ear which gives rise to temporary or permanent hearing impairment or deafness.\nSound pressure is measured in decibels and exposure to 75dB (even after long exposure) are usually safe. However, long or repeated to sounds at above 85dB can cause hearing loss. The louder the sound, the shorter the amount of time it takes for NIHL to happen.\nThe risk is higher especially in loud places as volume often needs to compete with the background noise. For example, the average sound level on a busy street is about 80dB. In the Airo study, when the outdoor noise was a mere 65dB, listeners raised headphone volume levels to over 80dB1997.\nThis figure shows the average chosen listening levels for our subjects across the different background noise levels2006:\n\nWhen we experience sound in our environment (TV, radio, traffic), normally these sounds are at safe levels, however long period of exposure to high sound pressure levels at high volume can be damaging to sensitive structures in the inner ear and cause noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).\nThe anatomy of hearing loss (simplified view):\n\nImage credits: HeadWise\nHearing damage from headphones is probably more common than from loudspeakers, even at comparable volumes, due to the close coupling of the transducers to the ears.\nSymptoms of hearing damage:\n\nRinging or buzzing in the ears.\nDifficulty in understanding speech.\nSlight muffling of sounds.\nDifficulty understanding speech in noisy places or places with poor acoustics.\n\nRecommendations\nThe WHO recommends that young people limit the use of personal audio player to one hour a day in an effort to limit exposure to noise.\nNIOSH recommends a safe headphone listening volume of 85dB. Although headphones are not sold with SPL meters, they can be purchased separately.\n\nOne could note of the volume control setting that pumps out 85dB, any music recorded at a higher level would still play back at dangerous levels. The headphones would have to be recalibrated whenever the music changed.\n\nWhile in-the-ear earphones can produce higher sound levels than over-the-ear earphones, they are not necessarily used at higher levels.\n\n\nThe table above shows NIOSH recommended maximum listening time per day, depending on the style of earphones used and the volume control settings on the player. On this chart, the \u201cIsolator\u201d style refers to earphones that have been reported to block out background noise, and \u201cSupra-Aural\u201d style refers to earphones that sit on top of the ear.

Unsafe levels of sounds can be, for example, exposure to in excess of 85 decibels (dB) for eight hours or 100 dB for 15 minutes. \nTeenagers and young people can better protect their hearing by keeping the volume down on personal audio devices, wearing earplugs when visiting noisy venues, and using carefully fitted, and, if possible, noise-cancelling earphones/headphones. They can also limit the time spent engaged in noisy activities by taking short listening breaks and restricting the daily use of personal audio devices to less than one hour. With the help of smartphone apps, they can monitor safe listening levels\n\nCauses of Hearing Loss in Adults at ASHA\n\nVery loud noise can cause permanent hearing loss. This is called noise-induced hearing loss. Listening to loud noise for long periods of time can damage the hair cells in the inner ear. Noise-induced hearing loss usually develops gradually and painlessly. A single exposure to an extremely loud sound such as an explosion can cause a sudden loss of hearing.

For lay (Non trained) people, there are more updated recommendations. The following is an example of the process, not the current recommendations.\n\nTo be effective, CPR must restore adequate coronary and cerebral blood flow. Interruptions in chest compressions lower coronary perfusion pressure and decrease rates of survival from cardiac arrest. In the first minutes of VF SCA, ventilation does not appear to be as important as chest compressions, but it does appear to contribute to survival from prolonged and asphyxial arrest. Certainly the ventilation rate needed to maintain a normal ventilation-perfusion ratio during CPR is much smaller than normal because pulmonary blood flow is low.\n\nThat is one of the opening paragraphs from this article published on the American Heart Association (AHA) website from 2005, regarding CPR evaluation and recommended changes. (VF SCA = Ventricular Fibrillation Sudden Cardiac Arrest)\nAs a summation, a group of scientists and heart experts (281 experts over 36 months) gathered to review all the study and epidemiological data regarding survival rate in witnessed SCA. They reviewed the (then) current survival rates, sequence and priorities in CPR to see how differences affected the survival rate. There are 57 articles cited throughout the article that are all listed with links.\nOne of the biggest factors was that few people received early CPR, and those that did, it wasn't always effective CPR. Some of the factors that they found were that chest compressions were inadequately performed, slow, and often interrupted for too long for rescue breaths, especially among lay CPR performers (Non EMS trained). This resulted in inadequate cerebral blood flow and cardiac output.\nOnce they determined that, the following excerpt explains how they evaluated the recommended changes (at that time, this is a 2005 publication.)\n\nMathematical and animal models showed that matching of pulmonary blood flow and ventilation might be more appropriate at compression-ventilation ratios higher than 15:2. There was concern, however, particularly among pediatric experts, that inadequate ventilation rates could reduce survival from pediatric and asphyxial (eg, drowning) arrest. To achieve optimal compression rates and reduce the frequency of interruptions in compressions, a universal compression-ventilation ratio of 30:2 for all lone rescuers of victims from infancy (excluding newborns) through adulthood is recommended by consensus, based on integration of the best human, animal, manikin, and theoretical data available. The 30:2 ratio is recommended to simplify training in 1-rescuer or 2-rescuer CPR for adults and all lay rescuer resuscitation. A compression-ventilation ratio of 15:2 is recommended for 2-rescuer CPR (a skill taught chiefly to healthcare providers and lifeguards) for infants and children (to the onset of puberty). This recommendation will result in the delivery of more rescue breaths per minute of CPR to victims with a high prevalence of asphyxial arrest. \n\nSo basically, a panel of experts gets together and reviews current literature and reports on survival from both field and hospital based sources. Along with that they review changes and practices that have been implemented (There is reference to early Automatic External Defibrillator {AED} devices being a key factor in survival rates) since the last recommendation. They pair this with animal and computer modeling to determine what should used for compression rates and compression/breath ratios.\nAs far as the differences, I do not know how to account for those other than people using outdated information, or not following guidelines. Here in the United States, (as far as I know), all CPR certification falls under the guidelines of the AHA.\n", "cardiology - What are pros and cons of different approaches to aborting ventricular tachycardia?": "\nPlease see the following society guidelines first:\nThe 2006 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology (ACC/AHA/ESC) guidelines:\n\n\u25cfThere is evidence and/or general agreement supporting RF ablation in\n  patients with symptomatic idiopathic VT that is drug-refractory, or in\n  such patients who are intolerant of drugs or do not desire long-term\n  drug therapy.\n\u25cfThe weight of evidence and/or opinion supports the use of beta\n  blockers and/or calcium channel blockers for the treatment of\n  symptomatic idiopathic VT.\n\u25cfThe weight of evidence and/or opinion supports the use of class IC\n  antiarrhythmic drugs as an alternative to or in combination with beta\n  blockers and/or calcium channel blockers for the treatment of\n  symptomatic idiopathic VT that arises from the RVOT. Subsequently, the\n  2009 European Heart Rhythm Association/Heart Rhythm Society (EHRA/HRS)\n  expert consensus statement recommended catheter ablation in the\n  following patients with idiopathic VT and without structural heart\n  disease [86]:\n\nSeverely symptomatic patients with monomorphic VT. \nMonomorphic VT in patients in whom antiarrhythmic drugs are not\n  effective, not tolerated, or not desired.  \nPatients with recurrent sustained polymorphic VT and VF (electrical storm) that is refractory to antiarrhythmic therapy when\n  there is a suspected trigger that can be targeted for ablation\n\n\nMedical (non-interventional/ablative) management is what is recommended-- especially verapamil or a beta blocker as they are easy to take (pills), and have a pretty nice side effect profile.  You can easily find the adverse effects online but they would primarily have to do with heart rate and blood pressure and those are easily monitored.\nAblation is a procedure a cardiology electrophysiologist would do in the \"cath lab.\"  This would be in conjunction with an \"EP Study\" which is an electrophysiology study of the heart to try to find the culprit location that starts the arrythmia.  Ablation is sometimes used (see above) in medical-refractory cases.\nYou can consider amiodarone or other antiarrythmics but they have more side effects.  Amiodarone is known to have a very long half life and a long list of side effects which require chronic monitoring (thyroid issues, lung issues, etc.) which is why they are not really first line usually in these cases though can be added on to the first line agents mentioned above.\nAs an aside:\n\nCardioversion, per the roots of the word, is changing/turning the direction of the heart--> You can think of this as changing the rhythm.\nDefibrillation is a subset of cardioversion where it is done without any synchronization in cases of ventricular fibrillation.  Defibrillation = Asynchronous cardioversion\nMany medical providers use the term cardioversion in cases of only supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia (in this case usually synchronous)\n- Cardioversion, as it is changing the rhythm of the heart (electrical or chemical), includes defibrillation but usually is used as a term specific to supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia as defibrillation is more specific when cardioversion is used in ventricular fibrillation.\n\n", "nutrition - Does decaffeinated coffee inhibit iron intake as much as normal coffee does?": "\nDoes coffee inhibit the absorption of iron? The answer appears to be yes (see links and references below). So does tea. Note that this does not have to do with caffeine, but rather polyphenols, phytates found in them. So, my answer would be that both regular coffee and decaf coffee inhibit iron, but I don't know whether one does so more than the other. Also, if you add milk to your coffee, that may also have some effect, because calcium inhibits iron absorption. \nIt also depends on whether it's heme iron (mostly from animals) or non-heme iron (from plant sources, iron fortified foods). This matters if you eat primarily a vegetarian diet, because the recommended intake for non-heme iron is 1.8 times, compared to those who eat meat . NIH's Iron\nDietary Supplement Fact Sheet  compiled a great literature review on iron intake.  See also CDC.\nReferences \nHurrell RF, Reddy M, Cook JD.

It's not even a set of closely related diseases, it's just a name for anything affecting the joints and/or connective tissue. As such, there is a wide range of illnesses and causes for these illnesses. \nWhat most people mean when they say rheumatism is arthritis, which is yet another word for a wide range of illnesses, though at least a more narrow one for ones affecting the joints. Most prominent among those diseases are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. \nOsteoarthritis is also known as \"degenerative arthritis\". As the name says, it is a degenerative disease, the primary cause is damage from mechanical stress, whether from repetitive movement or mechanical injury. It is not caused by getting cold.\nHowever, people with arthritis often feel worse when experiencing high humidity combined with low barometric pressure. \nRheumatoid arthritis has a very different cause - it is an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the joints and as a response, the joint capsule swells. While autoimmune diseases are still being understood, they often have a genetic and an environmental component. This environmental component can be an infection, which could coincide with someone getting very cold. This connection is very weak at best, though. \nHowever, proving a negative is hard, so there is no evidence that windy or wet weather can't cause arthritis. However, when looking at epidemiological data for rheumatoid arthritis \n\nThe incidence appears to be highest in Pima Indians (5.3%) and Chippewa Indians (6.8%), and lowest in people from China and Japan (0.2%-0.3%) \n\nAs I understand it, Japan actually has a \"rainy season\" for several weeks a year. \nIs it impossible that some form of arthritis (which is the umbrella term for a wide range of diseases) often appears in regions where it is windy? No, of course not. But this belief has all the marks of confirmation bias - if you live in a wet and windy climate, you get wet or cold a lot without suddenly developing joint pain. However, the one time it does happen, it's the weather's fault... And because high humidity makes osteoarthritis worse, that might be the first time someone really notices their condition. \nSources and further reading\nOverview of Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and Diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis\nCauses of osteoarthritis\nCauses of rheumatoid arthritis\nOverview of Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and Diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis\nWeather and osteoarthritis\n", "cryotherapy - Cold spray vs cold gel vs ice pack vs ice bath for tendinopathy": "\nPlease refer to this question for a discussion of the benefits of icing. (It is essentially of unproven benefit.) \nThere is another more effective therapy for tendinitis: stretching. \nI have personally had patients with lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) unresolved for six months that began a regimen of stretching like below and had their symptoms resolve completely within four days.\n(1) Stretch the tendinitis in the direction that hurts the most. This means you have identified where the tendon needs to be more lax. \n(2) Hold the stretch for OVER 20 SECONDS. This is the most important part. Most people stretch only long enough to inflame a tendinitis. You are aiming to stretch the fibers. \n(3) Repeat multiple times a day.

However, if you don't have any other problems, there's nothing wrong with that.\nYou're young, and have less bone and more cartilage in your nose relative to it's size than adults have. If you find and press the noses of other kids your age, then do so with adults, you'll notice a significant difference between the adults and the kids, though not all of the kids' noses will flatten as much as yours.\nThough noses are different, in this picture you can see a woman and a young child. Their noses are quite different in length. The baby's would be very compressible. The woman, not so much. \n\nThis is a young woman's nose with the underlying structures labeled. The septal cartilage, from the top almost to the bottom between the nostrils and the two upper lateral nasal cartilages fuse together and to the nasal bone. (The lower nasal cartilages don't fuse, so the tip of the nose always stays very flexible. Your lower nasal cartilages make up more of your nose than hers, so more of your nose is flexible.) \nYour nose will be bendable depending on how long your nasal bone is - it's longer in some than in others, and it's longer in adults than kids. Your nasal bone - the really hard part that projects down from between your eyebrows - may be short, making your nose more compressible.\n\nI said in the beginning \"if you don't have any other problems\". Place your index finger on your upper lip and press hard enough that you can feel your teeth and gums. Now move your whole finger up toward the columulla (it separates the two nostrils on the outside.) Did you feel a hard bone above your lip (it's kind of triangle shaped with the base - against your lip - wider than the tip (which fuses with the septal cartilage.) If you don't have a bone there, you should ask your doctor to check your nose just in case.\nCongenital anomalies of the nose are very rare and occur in 1/20,000\nto 1/40,000 newborns, so it's highly unlikely you have one. Most of the time they are associated with other facial problems, for example a small chin (I can see yours, and it's fine). If you can breathe normally through your nose, and the only trick you can do with your body is to flatten your nose (great party trick!) you are just fine.\nIsolated congenital partial absence of the left lower lateral nasal cartilage: case report\nCongenital Malformations of the Nose\n", "diet - How can one measure if vitamins are really helping a patient to delay hair loss?": "\nThe absolute key to know if ANY treatment is working would be to find out that things get better after such treatment started, in this particular case, you want hair-loss to decelerate.  \nIn order to register a change, you need to first register the previous state of affairs, so you'd have to calculate hair-loss rate both before and after the treatment was started.\nFirst of all you wanna be sure it is actually a problem or if it isn't at all.\nIf the rate of hair loss is not accelerating in a way that indicates some pathological problem, then there wouldn't be anything to worry about because humans normally lose some hair and grow some new.\nOtherwise, if the hair is falling in an accelerating manner and the amount of new hair does not correlate, then a diagnose of the cause and a treatment may be necessary.  \nThe cause is beyond the scope of this question so I'll stay on topic by elaborating on measurement and calculations.\nThis calculations shouldn't be done by means of human perception (e.g. photographs or simple observation) you want a method that's less fallible, there are other suggested \"practical\" methods like wearing a cap all day and then count the amount of hair that stays on the cap when you take the cap off and when you take a bath, this kind of methods are messy and there are multiple chances where mistakes can be made, so I'd say error-prone methods like this are useless. Not to mention, wearing a cap at all times is not practical and may even make things worse.  \nI found some very interesting articles licensed under Creative Commons in the National Library of Medicine.\nThe first one describe a variety of methods, ranging from non-invasive to semi-invasive to invasive.\n\nNon-invasive methods\ne.g., Questionnaire, daily hair counts, standardized wash test, 60-s\n  hair count, global photographs, dermoscopy, hair weight, contrasting\n  felt examination, hair feathering test, phototrichogram and\n  TrichoScan.\nSemi-invasive methods\ne.g., Trichogram and unit area trichogram (UAT).\nInvasive methods\ne.g., Scalp biopsy.\n\nA scalp biopsy seems way to invasive and not suitable to be doing it frequently in order to calculate a rate of acceleration/deceleration, so I investigated further on the Thrichogram option; it turns that method has been used and approached from different angles since the 80s:\n\nThis personal technical adaptation gives an easily obtainable definition of five quantitative parameters analysing the hair on a given area of the scalp: density of implantation, telogen percentage, growth rate, mean anagen diameter and percentage of fine hair less than 40 mu in diameter. In the normal male adult our measurements gave the following results on the vertex: density 204 +/- 10 hair per square centimeter, telogen percentage 17.8 +/- 2.8 p. 100, growth rate 0.35 +/- 0.03 mm p. day, mean anagen diameter 76 +/- 5 mu, percentage of fine hair 9.2 +/- 1.8\n\nAnd there seems to have been some progress recently in the development of instruments to aid in such methods:\n\nTo properly assess the progression and treatment response of alopecia, one must measure the changes in hair mass, which is influenced by both the density and diameter of hair. Unfortunately, a convenient device for hair mass evaluation had not been available to dermatologists until the recent introduction of the cross-section trichometer, which directly measures the cross-sectional area of an isolated bundle of hair.\n\nThe article mentions one particular trademarked device but there must be others. So there you have it, I'll venture to state with some confidence that the best approach is to use some device like that one and measure your scalp at least one time a day. And for security sake and professionalism sake, I'd recommend some expert assistance from a dermatologist. But if you have a Scientific Mind and a Hacker Spirit, do it yourself, why not.\n(Just the measurement part, don't diagnose yourself.)\nSo in this particular case, if vitamins don't decelerate your hair loss rate, then to hell with vitamins, you may need something else, so go to a doctor and get properly diagnosed.\n", "air quality - How healthy are hands-free stenomasks?": "\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic some new attention has come to mask wearing pressure injuries. On a very general level, pressure injuries happen mostly to immobilized patients or those with sensitive skin, such as early borns or babies.\nThat said and as an aside there is the NPIAP which is a society exclusively concerned with pressure induced injuries: https://npiap.com/\nI couldn't find any specific information the referred mask model, however, here are some general guidelines issued by the NPIAP to prevent pressure injuries. They include\n\nrelieve pressure when possible\nreduce pressure intensity when possible\navoid moist (softened) skin\navoid friction\n\nPressure is defined by force exerted on an area, therefore it may also be a good idea to increase the area therefore reducing the force applied to the area.\nFor COVID-19 there is also a position paper on N95 masks: https://cdn.ymaws.com/npiap.com/resource/resmgr/position_statements/Mask_Position_Paper_FINAL_fo.pdf\nThere is some more information on prevention and some general information on therapy for pressure injuries here: https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/abp5591\nThese are not specific to masks and involve recommendations such as rotation the places where pressures is applied; this is mostly applicable to immobilized patients. For these patients rotation of their bodies so that the body weight pressured is applied to different regions of the body can be beneficial. A takeaway may be to try applying pressure to different areas of the face, such as using different models of masks over time. A strategy with stenomasks may be to have at least two different models so that they can be worn alternately.\nAs for the quality of air: I assume the air surrounding you when wearing the masks is relatively clean and breathable to begin with (otherwise a different kind of mask may be necessary). As far as depletion of oxygen and enrichment with carbon-dioxide goes, I assume that the stenomask will have to have passed some testing that will prevent CO2-intoxication when used for prolonged time. There may be some information on this in the masks' manual. If someone has a link to that, feel free to post it in the comments.\n", "Why aren't tendons affected by chronic tendinopathy replaced by artificial tendons?": "\nTendons don't usually get replaced because there is tendon repair surgery instead. Getting your tendon (or any body part for that matter) replaced by an artificial tendon usually takes longer to recover than a tendon repair surgery, and also leaves you with some lifetime limitations, such as not be able to lift weight and you will not be able to compete in sports that involve the tendon that got replaced as actively. Tendon repair surgeries tend to take less time to recover from, and they also have a high success rate (if you do proper therapy).\n\nTendon Repair Surgery\nHand Surgery: Replacement and Tendon Repair\n", "diet - Are organic foods healthier than conventional foods?": "\nTL;DR - Organic foods don't seem to have a significant difference as of what studies can prove, which is why conventional or organic, people should make sure they're getting the proper nutrients that their bodies need.\n\nBrief History of Pesticide Usage\nThe first recorded use of insecticides is about 4500 years ago by Sumerians who used sulphur compounds to control insects and mites, whilst about 3200 years ago the Chinese were using mercury and arsenical compounds for controlling body lice. In the 1920s there were even cases of using arsenic, which was replaced by DDT usage until the new chemical was discovered to have severe consequences (harm to non-target plants and animals as well as problems with residues). DDT is linked with cancer, endocrine disruption, and reproductive and developmental effects. Over time, people began to switch to organic pesticides to get away from the health scares (or threats) of these synthetic chemicals.\nTo address the question, we should first be clear about what organic means.\nRegarding produce:\n\nContrary to what most people believe, \"organic\" does not automatically mean \"pesticide-free\" or \"chemical-free\" ... it means that these pesticides, if used, must be derived from natural sources, not synthetically manufactured.\n\nRegarding Farmed Meats (some of the key requirements):\n\nMust be raised organically on certified organic land\nMust be fed certified organic feed\nNo antibiotics or added growth hormones are allowed*\nMust have outdoor access\n\nOrganic food covers a wide variety of techniques and different types of foods that all have their own types of legal loop-holes, or possible work-around strategies.\nThere are many pesticides that are naturally produced by plants which farmers use, but that doesn't mean they aren't dangerous. In contrast, just because a pesticide is synthetic doesn't immediately indicate that it's more dangerous than natural products. Some pesticides that are approved by the government may be harmless in small quantities, but when organic producers attempt to refuse these, they may turn to alternatives that are even more dangerous, just to keep the label \"organic\".\nIn another case, farmers could claim \"natural methods are insufficient to address critical issues of production\", and then treat their animals with antibiotics while still calling the meat organic.\nOn the other side of this issue, some people argue that the less chemicals we consume in general, the better. Even if they might be government approved, that doesn't prove they're completely non-toxic.\nThe Stanford paper claim that there just isn't enough evidence to prove a significant difference in health benefits/risks. They don't necessarily have more nutrients, decrease the risk of any diseases, or have higher nutritional content except for phosphorus, which most people get enough of anyways. However, the study does suggest organic foods contain less pesticides. The health risks of consuming less pesticides though, are still contested. \"Additionally, organic chicken and pork appeared to reduce exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, but the clinical significance of this is also unclear.\"\nWell what about taste?\n\nTaste is to a large extent subjective. Add to that\n  different varieties, different weather conditions, different soil\n  types and different soil management practices...\n\n - Does Organically Grown Food Taste Better?\nIt's nearly impossible to give a definitive answer of which tastes better. To pile onto the confusion, it's possible that the taste differences touted by some may simply derive from a \"health halo\".\nGenetically Modified Organisms\nIn response to the scares involved with pesticides in general, people began to research methods to minimize the amount of pesticide used. Basically, DNA from an external source is inserted into a plant so that the plant inherits some desirable traits. This allowed plants to develop natural immunities to certain bacteria and produce more or bigger produce. Over time, people became scared of GMOs as too good to be true. For the most part, scientists agree that GMOs pose no greater risk than conventional food (Expert evaluations from Europe found no verifiable toxic or deleterious effects from GM foods and crops). There are still legitimate concerns about using GMOs, such as allergy development in humans, toxicity levels of naturally produced pesticides in the plant, and antibiotic resistance of bacteria, but for the most part these are tested before distribution. Public wariness may be influenced by labels and commercialism.\nSecondary Effects of Organic Farming\nOrganic farming is good for the environment in the sense that it often leads to less pollution. Pesticides on crops often run-off into streams and rivers, interfering and even hurting local wildlife, but with organic pesticides, the chemicals decompose faster before they can cause massive change to their environment. There may be other potential benefits, but to feed the immense population that exists on earth, many debate whether organic farming is truly sustainable. \n\"Healthier\" depends on the context of the food: \nHow much pesticide is being used? How much exposure becomes a detriment? Does it have long-term consequences? What are the loopholes that producers are using?\nSo when you say \"organic\" and \"conventional\" it really depends on the process, producer, and product- all of which need to be studied in more detail to develop solid claims. \nCitations:\nHistory of Pesticides:\n\nIUPAC - History of Pesticide Use\nOregon State - History of Pesticide Use\nPesticide Usage in the United States: History, Benefits, Risks, and Trends\nToxipedia - DDT\n\nGMOs\n\nWikipedia - Genetically Modified Organism\n\nSecondary Effects of Organic Farming:\n\nFAO - What are the environmental benefits of organic agriculture?\n\nModern Pesticide Usage:\n\nStanford Researchers - Are Organic Foods Safer or Healthier Than Conventional Alternatives?: A Systematic Review\nHarvard - Organic food no more nutritious than conventionally grown food\nStanford - Little evidence of health benefits from organic foods, study finds\nPesticide Use Regulations on ORGANIC Fruit and Vegetable Farms\nPesticide Politics\nScience 20 - The Muddled Debate About Pesticide and GM Crops\n\n", "sports - Why can't artificial tendons withstand heavy lifting?": "\nI am sensing some mix up here. \nYour are asking about artificial tendons but your quote is stating about joint replacements.\nBasically your equating apples and oranges.\nJoint replacements or joint arthroplasties are used to treat severely destructed joints. In four cases of five the reason for joint destruction is osteoarthrosis in which the joint cartilage has worn off resulting to pure bone to bone contact which is very painful and disabling. \nDuring joint replacement surgery the severely damages joint surfaces are sawed off and they are replaced with identically shaped components. These component usually have two options for fixation. They can be cemented, in which polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is put in both components. Then components is compressed to molded end of the bone and cement penetrates to porous bone tissue. The better and deeper the cement penetration, the firmer is the fixation. Another option is to use hydroxyaphatite (HA) coated components. Component is again compressed against bone, but the fixation is achieved by bone ingrowth to to HA coating.\nBearing material is also important aspect in joint replacements. Knee and hip are by far the most commonly replaced joint. In hips there is usuallu metallic head bearing agains cup made from polyethylene (PE). In knee both komponents are usually metallic but there is an insert made from PE between components to reduce friction.\nFixation and bearing materials are the weak links in joint replacements. Weight lifting or heavy exercises are not recommended in patients with replaced joint. Most importantly wear is always present in each and every joint replacement, current medicine does not know a bearing material which does not wear. Wear of PE correlates with use. The more you put weight or strain to your hip/knee replacement the more it wears and more likely it will result to complications associated to increased release of PE particle. \nIntense repetitive movement in the joint can also cause cement debonding or breakage in the bone-HA interface and to loosening of the components. \nHip or knee are so complex mechanical systems that each and every movement or momentum can not be handled with current knowledge regarding mechanical aspects joint replacements. At this time joint replacements tolerate very well walking, daily activities and light weight training. \nOf course nowadays we can use all ceramic or all metallic bearings but I won\u00b4t dig in to those. Use of PE is so common and traditional in joint replacements that these restriction quoted by OP are important to >90% of patients. Tour de France winner Floyd Landis for example has all metallic hip replacement.\nArtificial tendons are another thing. Treatment of ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is very common procedure these days. Most commonly ACL is replaced with autograft. That means a tissue retrieved from another site in the SAME patient. \nIn ACL reconstruction common site for tendon autograft is hamstring or gracilis tendon graft. This graft is retrieved with special instruments, cut to required length ja then fixed with bioabsorbable screws to femur and tibia. With time the tendon provides perfect ingrowth to the bone since the tendon is retrieved from same patient and there is no issue regarding tissue rejection. \nUsually young patient with ACL rupture can return to heavy exercise without any restrictions after successful ACL reconstruction.\n", "Can you sleep less permanently, but stay at least as healthy?": "\nModern Science\nAccording to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, sleep is certainly needed, that too quality sleep for certain hours. 4-5 hours seems less to me.\nIt says --\n\nStudies show that a good night's sleep improves learning. Whether you're learning math, how to play the piano, how to perfect your golf swing, or how to drive a car, sleep helps enhance your learning and problem-solving skills. Sleep also helps you pay attention, make decisions, and be creative.\nStudies also show that sleep deficiency alters activity in some parts of the brain. If you're sleep deficient, you may have trouble making decisions, solving problems, controlling your emotions and behavior, and coping with change. Sleep deficiency also has been linked to depression, suicide, and risk-taking behavior.\n\nFurthermore,\n\nSleep plays an important role in your physical health. For example, sleep is involved in healing and repair of your heart and blood vessels. Ongoing sleep deficiency is linked to an increased risk of heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and stroke.\nSleep deficiency also increases the risk of obesity. For example, one study of teenagers showed that with each hour of sleep lost, the odds of becoming obese went up. Sleep deficiency increases the risk of obesity in other age groups as well.\n\nThe Guardian reports that less than six hours of sleep affect the genes. And, there are many drawbacks as well.\nAbout celebs or known personalities sleeping 4 hours and working perfectly okay is considered as a myth!\nWebMD, in its \"7 Myths About Sleep\" mentions...\n\nLegendary short sleepers \u2014 including Bill Clinton, Madonna, and Margaret Thatcher \u2014 don't necessarily do better on fewer Zs. \"They're just not aware of how sleepy they are,\" says Thomas Roth, Ph.D., sleep researcher at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. Too little sleep is bad for your health and your image: It can make you ineffective (it impairs performance, judgment, and the ability to pay attention), sick (it weakens your immune system), and overweight. In fact, women who slept five hours or less a night were a third more likely to gain 33 pounds or more over 16 years than women who slept seven hours, according to a Harvard Nurses' Health Study. Oddly, cutting too much sleep and getting less than six hours is associated with the same problems as sleeping too long: a higher risk of heart problems and death. And, of course, cheating on sleep hurts you behind the wheel: \"Wakefulness for 18 hours makes you perform almost as though you're legally drunk,\" says Walsleben.\n\nIn an article on DailyMail.co.uk, it says that less than 6 hr of sleep increases the risks of having stroke even if you are fit and healthy. That said, those sleeping for less hours might look fit, but they are at the risks of something fatal.\n[For those who believe only in evidences, the answer ends here]\n\n[For those who believe more in traditional medicines, folk medicines and alternative medicines than researches, Ayurveda has an explanation]\nAyurvedic Aspect\nThere's something called 'satmya (saa-t-m-ya)'. In Ayurveda, it's described that if you start 'practicing' something with your body, your body 'gets adjusted' and it does not suffer the way others suffer with 'that practice'. In other words, I have been eating potatoes both the times for past 35 years AND it does not cause any harm to my body. It has become an integral part of my life and my body considers it as 'natural thing'.\nSaid that, if someone, right from his/her childhood or early adulthood has started practicing sleeping for a few hours, the body adjusts to it, and they find no problem with sleeping less as compared to those sleeping for 8 hrs regularly (from their childhood/early adulthood).\nIn my practice, I've seen people with more than 140 sugar, or 140/100 mmHg blood pressure with absolutely no signs of deteriorated health. While modern science finds it difficult to answer, Ayurveda says that the body has adjusted to whatsoever conditions it's living in.\n", "dermatology - Is constantly using oily moisturizer bad for your skin?": "\nYour skin will not make enough protective lipids regardless of whether you use moisturizer or not. With your skin, it's actually better if you use it every day, at least on areas where you get eczema.\nEczema (or Atopic Dermatitis) is an incompletely understood skin disorder, in which the normal skin barrier function (permeability) is compromised, allowing the skin to dry out more than normal skin. The cause of the dryness in AD is thought by some to be a deficiency of a naturally occurring fatty substance in the skin called ceramide. Others believe it's an abnormal or missing protein which causes the skin barrier to be compromised, allowing allergens and irritants to cause immune responses more easily, triggering the itch/chronic inflammation (this might explain the response seen with topical steroids). \nWhatever the case may be, moisturizers do provide a barrier of some type to the skin and help to decrease transepidermal water loss; therefore they are highly recommended for AD. Not using moisturizer will leave you open to more problematic eczema. Your skin will not make enough protective lipids regardless of whether you use moisturizer or not. You should use it every day, at least on areas where you get eczema.\nOther things which help Atopic Dermatitis involve water temperature when bathing (the cooler, the better), patting your skin dry instead of vigorous rubbing, applying the moisturizer immediately after bathing when your skin has already been moistened by the water, getting a reasonable amount of sun on affected areas, avoiding wool and heavy clothing that might make you sweat, using \"gentle\" soaps (only soaping up areas that need cleaning), showering briefly twice a day instead of once (applying moisturizer afterwards!) etc.\nThere are some new ceramide-based moisturizers that have been shown to be helpful in AD. Some are very expensive while others are more reasonably priced. Some dermatologists have recommended TriCeram. You can spot test it (one arm or one affected area) to save money while evaluating how well it works for you.\nDetermining what kinds of moisturizers work best for you involves trial and error, but whatever works, from petrolatum or Aquaphor, coconut oil (frectionated coconut oil and Johoba oil absorb into the skin a bit better so are less greasy), or another type, don't be hesitant to use it.

What does it do? It triggers the TRPM8 ion channels, causing your skin's cold receptor to become sensitive, and causing it to overfire.\nThis causes the brain (receiving cold signals from skin) to feel cold, and that's why you feel cold.\nI have summarised it in a few sentences, but as with any scientific discovery, it took quite a few years to fully understand what was going on. NCBI have summarised this quite nicely over here (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5238/)\n", "What effects does alcohol have on underage children?": "\nAlcohol is a psychoactive drug that acts as a central nervous system depressant.\nDrinking under-age increases alcohol risks in later life. Research shows the brain keeps developing well into the twenties, during which time it continues to establish important communication connections and further refines its function and studies show that young people who drink heavily may put themselves at risk for a range of potential health problems.\nExtreme alcohol consumption can cause memory loss, loss of coordination and alcohol poisoning, in some cases can be fatal.\nHealth risks associated with drinking include:\n\nbrain effects,\nAlcohol interferes with communication between nerve cells and all other cells limiting the ability to think clearly.\nFirst alcohol affects the forebrain responsible for motor coordination and decision making.

Several different theories have been proposed on why vaccines could cause autism, such as the ingredient in some vaccines thimerosal being harmful, but these have all been disproved by many different experiments.\nMany reliable sources such as the CDC1 says that there is no link between autism an vaccines. A 2011 report2 from the Institute of Medicine that tested 8 different vaccines on both adults and children showed that the vaccines are very safe.\n\nA 2013 CDC study3 added to the research showing that vaccines do not cause ASD. The study looked at the number of antigens (substances in vaccines that cause the body\u2019s immune system to produce disease-fighting antibodies) from vaccines during the first two years of life. The results showed that the total amount of antigen from vaccines received was the same between children with ASD and those that did not have ASD.\n\nThe CDC has also funded many other studies on vaccine ingredients and their links to autism, especially thimerosal4, a mercury-based ingredient used in some vaccines. These studies have shown \"no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and ASD, as well as no link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and ASD in children.\"\nFull list of CDC studies on the link between vaccines and autism5\nThese are pretty convincing, but you can't just rely on one source, right?\n\nAn issue in the Oxford Journal6 also shows how even though there have been many claims that vaccines do cause autism, there aren't any studies that help support this claim.\n\nA worldwide increase in the rate of autism diagnoses\u2014likely driven by broadened diagnostic criteria and increased awareness\u2014has fueled concerns that an environmental exposure like vaccines might cause autism. Theories for this putative association have centered on the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, thimerosal, and the large number of vaccines currently administered. However, both epidemiological and biological studies fail to support these claims.\n\nOne study that took place in the UK from 1979-19927 found that even though there was an increase in cases of autism, there was no jump in the amount of cases when the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, another controversial vaccine, was introduced in 1988.\nA 2003 study in metropolitan Atlanta8, Georgia compared the ages that the MMR vaccine was given in children with autism against the age that children without autism received it. The results were that the proportion of time that children were vaccinated in both control groups was similar.\nThe Oxford Journal entry mentioned many other studies that tested the link between MMR vaccines and autism and there has been no plausible evidence.\nThe other vaccine ingredient that is also said to cause autism is thimerosal, which I mentioned before. The Oxford Journal issue also shows studies about this link.\nA study in Finland9 helped show that there wasn't a link between thimerosal and autism. In fact, cases of autism increased in 1992 after thimerosal-containing vaccines were discontinued.\nAnother study in the UK10 also disproved the theory that thimerosal causes autism. They actually found that thimerosal-containing vaccines might even have a beneficial effect in children.\nThere have also been many other studies that invalidate the link between thimerosal and autism.\nOne last theory that has been proposed is that multiple vaccines being administered to a child simultaneously can weaken their immune system and cause autism. This theory is flawed for several reasons.\nThis article11 used data from many studies and found that vaccines do not overwhelm and weaken an infant's immune system. Infants are able to respond well to the many vaccines that are given to them.\nAnother study12 found that vaccines did not weaken the immune system to any diseases. They were unable to find consistent relationship between infectious diseases and immunization.\n\nAll of this scientific evidence leaves one question left to be answered.\nWhy do any people believe that vaccines cause autism? (this part will get some more opinion then you may like, but it is necessary)\nA fraudulent 1998 study13 by Andrew Wakefield and colleagues was one of the main reasons that this controversy over vaccines and autism began. It used falsified data14 to support their claim that the MMR vaccine caused developmental problems and other autism symptoms. This study has since been retracted as it was demonstrated to be false. Dr. Wakefield, a physician in the UK, was struck off the Medical Registry due to his participation in this fraud.\nWebMD15 also talks about why there are still some people that believe that vaccines are the cause of autism.\n\nAnd when something bad happens to a child, people demand to know what or whom is to blame. \"Parents are clamoring for a cause,\" says David Tayloe, MD, a pediatrician in Greensboro, N.C., and president-elect of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).\n\"It's a terrible condition. It upsets families, and it upsets me.\" But all the fear and anger about vaccines is misplaced, he says. \"There's just nothing there.\"\n\nIt seems most people who claim that vaccines cause autism are just looking for something to blame for what is happening to children. Many parents may become angry when they find out their child has autism, and they put that anger against vaccines.\nThere are some logical arguments that people may present, such as changing of their child's behavior after receiving vaccines. This is mostly coincidence, as most children are vaccinated around the same time autism symptoms begin to appear (usually 12-18 months)16. Other than this and some of the arguments mentioned earlier, there is almost no reason to believe that vaccines cause autism.\n\n[1]  CDC - Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism\n[2]  Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality\n[3]  Increasing Exposure to Antibody-Stimulating Proteins and Polysaccharides in Vaccines Is Not Associated with Risk of Autism\n[4]  CDC - Frequently Asked Questions About Thimerosal\n[5]  CDC - Vaccines and Autism: A Summary of CDC Conducted or Sponsored Studies\n[6]  Vaccines and Autism: A Tale of Shifting Hypotheses\n[7]  Autism and measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine: no epidemiological evidence for a causal association\n[8]  Age at First Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccination in Children With Autism and School-Matched Control Subjects: A Population-Based Study in Metropolitan Atlanta\n[9]  Thimerosal and the Occurrence of Autism: Negative Ecological Evidence From Danish Population-Based Data\n[10]  Thimerosal Exposure in Infants and Developmental Disorders: A Prospective Cohort Study in the United Kingdom Does Not Support a Causal Association\n[11]  Addressing Parents\u2019 Concerns: Do Multiple Vaccines Overwhelm or Weaken the Infant\u2019s Immune System?\n[12]  DTP Immunization and Susceptibility to Infectious Diseases\n[13]  RETRACTED: Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children\n[14]  The MMR vaccine and autism: Sensation, refutation, retraction, and fraud\n[15]  WebMD - Autism-Vaccine Link: Evidence Doesn't Dispel Doubts\n[16]  When do children usually show symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?\n", "prescription - How far should I go to avoid antiboitics?": "\nHow refreshing to see someone with this attitude!

I went even further, explaining the really serious - but possible - risks and discussed the risk-to-benefit ratio. He called me ridiculous and left in a huff. Two days later, I got a call from the Hospital Administrator's office (my employer's boss). Turned out that the patient was a golfing buddy of his.

A baby's liver is one of the last organs to develop fully and doesn't mature until the latter stages of pregnancy, so cannot process alcohol. So if you drink at any time during your pregnancy, the alcohol can affect your baby.\nWhile the effects attributed to alcohol are still more common in heavier drinkers, they seem to happen at much lower drinking levels than seen in those with FAS.\nThe most severe of the alcohol-related conditions (due to heavy drinking) is Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS).

Really bad. It will be damaging to the baby, and possibly even to the mother.\nFirstly, smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriages. It can also cause premature birth, which can lead to many health complications, such as low weight, feeding difficulties, and breathing problems. A mother who smokes while pregnant is also twice as likely to have abnormal bleeding during both pregnancy and delivery. This is dangerous for both the birth mother and the baby. Smoking can also cause some birth defects and puts the baby at a higher risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The child also has a higher chance of having Cerebral Palsy (CP). When a child of a mother who smoked during pregnancy grows older, they might have lung and brain damage as they grow older.\nIf a mother is exposed to secondhand smoke during pregnancy, there is still a risk of many of the complications stated above. So, whether you are a pregnant mother or the husband of one or anyone else living or spending a lot of time with a pregnant mother, don't smoke.

He identified the mould as being from the Penicillium genus and after some months of calling it \"mould juice\", named the substance it released penicillin on 7 March 1929.\nFleming would later say:\n\n\"When I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn't plan to revolutionise all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer, but I suppose that was exactly what I did.\"\n\nSource: Sir Alexander Fleming\nSee also: Discovery of Penicillin\n", "nutrition - What should my daily intake of calories be?": "\nAs an approximation, there exist several different equations for calculating a basal/resting metabolic rate. These are:\n\nHarris-Benedict\nHarris-Benedict revised\nCunningham\nKatch-McCardle\nMifflin St. Jeor\n\nEach of these takes various factors such as age, lean body mass, sex into account in varying emphases to come up with a basal, or resting metabolic rate. This rate is basically how many calories you would need on a daily basis to simply breathe in and out all day long. If you run through all of them and then average, you should come pretty close to your basic needs. There are many calculators already programmed on the internet with these formulas, or you can get them here at the wiki link.\nOnce you have that, then you can take a look at the various sites on the internet that have calorie expenditures for various activities such as housework, office work, weightlifting, running, really just about any activity. Most of these are again approximations, the best charts will account for height/weight/age/sex. Add those to your BMR, and you should be pretty close to a daily intake need.\nReally, though, all you need to do is track your weight. Take note of any long term trends on the scale, and if you are gaining weight, cut back on calorie intake or food makeup (healthier vs. unhealthy). If you are losing too much weight, eat more. Don't be alarmed by daily fluctuations, you can vary quite a bit during a day. Best bet is to weigh yourself under the same conditions daily.\nIf you are lucky enough to have a college lab or similar that supports general testing for the public (You can occasionally get in on a kinesiology class testing phase where they need subjects), you can get exhaled gas analysis, and this can give you a very close estimate of calories burned during a specific activity. This is somewhat rare and/or costly to have done.\n", "Is it OK to snack on salted nuts for a high-fibre diet?": "\nLike most foods, salt should be consumed in moderation. Your body needs salt, but a good idea would be to try and cut down salt from some other parts of your diet. For example, get unsalted fries or no ketchup. Check the daily recommended value for an estimate of how much salt you're intaking. Furthermore (thanks to Carey Gregory for pointing this out), drinking water may NOT be the best idea to offset the sodium intake. According to dietitian Monica Reinagel(from LiveStrong link), \n\n\"drinking some extra water after a high-sodium meal may help flush\n  some of the sodium from your body and may also help get rid of some\n  retained water to reduce bloating...\nJust drinking more water, however, is not a solution for a long-term\n  high-sodium diet, says Reinagel. The increased blood volume that\n  results from your body holding onto the excess water is what raises\n  your blood pressure.\n\nSo depending on the rest of your diet, you could better judge for yourself whether salted nuts are ok, or maybe unsalted would be better.\nIf you happen to have a high-sodium diet and don't like the taste of unsalted nuts, it would be a good time to look into alternative sources of fiber.\nhttp://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/salt-and-your-health\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygroscopy\nhttp://jap.physiology.org/content/65/1/332.short\nhttp://www.livestrong.com/article/529042-does-drinking-water-flush-out-sodium-in-the-body/\nInteresting Read if you want to know more about sodium removal from body- \nncbi.nlm.nih.gov: Sweat rate and sodium loss during work in the heat\n", "scientific method - Is there a proven way to test if I'm susceptible to the placebo effect?": "\nNo, there isn't, not in any meaningful way.\n\"The placebo effect\" is an umbrella term, used primarily in the media/pop science. That isn't to say it isn't real or valid, but it covers outcomes from a great many different studies.\nIn drug trials, the effects of a drug are often compared to a placebo - a sugar pill/saline injection - even placebo surgery.\nThe placebo \"effect\" is what happens when you compare a placebo to nothing at all, and the patients on the placebo have statistically better outcomes.\nThe key points here are:\n\nThe placebo effect is a feature of large studies. You can't perform a large study on a single patient. In individual cases, there is simply too much variability - you can never know if a difference in outcome was due to \"the placebo effect\" or some other variable.\nYou cannot perform the two halves of the study (placebo/nothing at all) yourself. You would have to run them sequentially, i.e. on different instances of cold/flu. This adds more variables.\nThe placebo effect requires you to not know you're taking a placebo (patients in these studies are not told what it is about, they're just given pills/injections etc.) I can't think of a way you could feasibly set up a scenario where you were A) testing yourself for \"the placebo effect\", and B) not aware you are being given a placebo.\n\n", "dermatology - If I think my mole is changing, what should I do?": "\nGet to a doctor or dermatologist straight away\nA changing mole is an indicator of possible melanoma.

Now, while the exact figure of 3500 calories is somewhat open to debate, that is the rationale. 500 calories a day = 1 pound of loss per week.\nThe problem with crash dieting is twofold. One, the majority of the weight lost is water weight, and will rapidly return once the person hydrates themselves. The second problem is that in an effort to lose large amounts of weight in a short time is that people will essentially starve themselves, and possibly do so while adding in exercise.\nIn the very short term, this may not pose any problems for a healthy person, but if the dieter is compromised in any way health wise, or the practice is continued for a longer period then nutrient deficiencies can start arising, which can introduce a long litany of health problems.\nAnother problem is that people that lose large amounts of weight in a short time tend to binge eat once the diet period is over, and regain most if not all the weight. Many even end up weighing more than they did before they did the extreme dieting.\nThere have been studies comparing many of the popular diets such as Atkins, South Beach, China Study, Paleo, and on and on. They have all shown that weight loss is a simple factor of calorie reduction. Eat less calories than you expend, and you will lose weight. Period. (And \"starvation mode\" is a myth.) When you first start dieting, you may lose more than the 1-2 pounds a week, which is normal. After a bit, your body will readjust and the weight loss will slow down, however if you maintain the calorie deficit, you will eventually lose the weight.\nAs requested:\nNew England Journal of Medicine\nAnnals of Internal Medicine (Short abstract)\nJournal of the American Dietetic Assn.\nThe Lancet (Not a study, but references two studies)\n\nA systematic review of low-carbohydrate diets found that the weight loss achieved is associated with the duration of the diet and restriction of energy intake, but not with restriction of carbohydrates. Two groups have reported longer-term randomised studies that compared instruction in the low-carbohydrate diet with a low-fat calorie-reduced diet in obese patients (N Engl J Med 2003; 348: 2082\u201390; Ann Intern Med 2004; 140: 778\u201385).

They concluded that zinc supplements have a beneficial effect on children.1\nAnother study (done by the same researchers as the second study I linked to) tested the effects of zinc lozenges on treating cold symptoms. They found that taking zinc lozenges within 24 hours of first getting cold symptoms may reduce the length of the cold. They do not give any firm recommendation though, because of insufficient data. They also mention the same side-effects as above.2 This study is also backed up by other similar study which found that zinc lozenges reduced the duration of colds by about 7 days, again with only minor side effects such as bad taste and mouth irritation.3 Other similar reports' results showed that zinc lozenges not only reduce the duration of colds, but also the severity.4, 5\nSome studies say that zinc lozenges do not have any noteworthy therapeutic effect in treating the common cold.6, 7\nShould you take zinc lozenges?\nNo studies have provided sufficient information to prove or disprove beneficial effects of taking zinc lozenges to prevent and treat the common cold. The consumption of zinc lozenges doesn't present any dangerous or deadly effects, unless you consider bad taste and nausea deadly. As of now, experts recommend talking to your doctor to decide if taking zinc \nlozenges is right for you.8\nWhat is the best type of zinc lozenge to take?\nWell first, as I said above, there is no conclusive evidence. There is also no definite best type of zinc lozenge to take. Of the studies that showed positive results, zinc gluconate was used the most, but zinc sulfate and zinc acetate were also shown to be effective. Of the trials that showed no noteworthy effect, zinc gluconate was also the most tested type, but zinc acetate also showed no effect. According to WebMD, researchers are still trying to figure out which type of zinc lozenge is the best.\nRisks of taking zinc supplements\nTaking zinc lozenges hasn't been shown to produce any major side-effects. Sometimes, people taking them may experience bad taste in their mouth and possibly nausea. Nasal spray, as you mentioned is also not good. It may even cause loss of smell.\n\n[1]  Effects of Zinc Supplementation in Occurrence and Duration of Common Cold in School Aged Children during Cold Season: a Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial\n[2]  Zinc for the common cold\n[3]  Reduction in duration of common colds by zinc gluconate lozenges in a double-blind study\n[4]  Duration and severity of symptoms and levels of plasma interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor, and adhesion molecules in patients with common cold treated with zinc acetate.\n[5]  Efficacy of zinc against common cold viruses: an overview.\n[6]  Two randomized controlled trials of zinc gluconate lozenge therapy of experimentally induced rhinovirus colds. \n[7]  Effect of treatment with zinc gluconate or zinc acetate on experimental and natural colds.\n[8]  Will taking zinc for colds make my colds go away faster?\nWebMD - Zinc for Colds: Lozenges & Nasal Sprays\n", "bioelectromagnetics - Effects caused by staying near the mobile network towers": "\nMany countries have done studies that seem to indicate short-term exposure to the radiation does not increase risk of cancer.\n\n(German) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16443797\n(Danish) http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/23/1707.abstract\n(Swedish) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15746469\n(US) http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/newsfromnci/2012/GliomaCellPhoneUse\n\nHowever, some countries are still uncertain about this, and have requested companies move their towers away from people by at least 100 meters.\nAn Italian court even acknowledged a \"causal\" link:\nhttp://www.prlog.org/12004383-italian-supreme-court-rules-cell-phones-can-cause-cancer.html\nbut this has been deeply criticized by public health leaders in places like the US.\nFor the most part, there hasn't been substantial evidence to say that the towers cause harm to humans more than 100 meters away. Particularly in the case of short-distance exposure, there hasn't been much data because many times base stations are not turned off during maintenance, but the power being sent through to the antennas is cut off, so that the workers do not have to work near live antennas, but a study over around 50 years of people exposed to Radio Frequency (RF) waves indicates no significant negative consequences.

Inhaled smoke is a mixture of smoke from the burning end of a cigarette or cigar and the smoke exhaled from the lungs of smokers.

The excess risk is of the order of 20% for women and 30% for men and remains after controlling for some potential sources of bias and confounding.\n\nOther studies confirmed these findings, such as study from 2007 by American Journal of Public Health which claim2004, PDF:\n\nA strong relationship was observed between lung cancer and duration of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.

Because of this, there's probably no completely specific answer to this question, but it can be answered generally.\nRhinovirus-caused colds (which are a large majority of \"common\" colds) are typically contagious at the beginning, and are much less contagious after a few days2. You are most at risk of transmitting the virus to someone else for the 4-5 days after being exposed yourself3 - not necessarily when symptoms appear.\nIn other words, you can definitely be asymptomatic and still contagious. On the other hand, if you still feel symptoms after a week, the chances are much lower that you're actually still contagious.\n\nReferences:\n1: Common Cold: Virology (wikipedia)\n2: Incubation Periods of Experimental Rhinovirus Infection and Illness\n3: When are colds contagious?\n", "disease transmission - Is pneumonia contagious?": "\nMostly it depends on the cause of the pneumonia. \nPneumonia is the name for infection or inflammation of the lungs. It can be primary or secondary. A good example of the difference is pneumonia caused by the influenza virus.\nInfluenza affects the lungs directly. That's a primary pneumonia, and yes, this is contagious, as the air one coughs out contains droplets carrying the virus. Pneumonia caused by viruses is more common in children and young adults (except for influenza, which affects all age groups), and is therefore contagious to people who have never been exposed to the virus - usually other children/young adults. In general, primary pneumonia tends to be more contagious, and besides viruses, it can be caused by mycoplasma and tuberculosis. These are contagious.\nThe damage done by the influenza virus in the lungs leaves the person susceptible to attack by bacteria that would not normally gain a foothold in the lung. This is secondary pneumonia, and because your lungs are not damaged - and you already have the same bacteria in your mouth and throat as someone with secondary pneumonia but are not ill - you are much less likely to get sick from being exposed to bacterial pneumonia than from someone with viral pneumonia.\nSimilarly, pneumonia is more common in smokers with damaged lungs, or in people with some degree of decreased immunocompetence. Alcohol, other drugs, and people with swallowing disorders can aspirate leading to pneumonia; surgery or chest injuries where deep breathing hurts can also lead to pneumonia. These pneumonias aren't likely to be contagious. Finally, some pneumonias are caused by exposure to chemicals. Since there's no infectious agent involved, you can't be affected.\nThere are now vaccines against some of the bacterial pneumonias, so vaccines against influenza and others help.\nSince you might not know what kind of pneumonia someone has, practicing good hygiene is always a good idea.\nPneumonia Mayo Clinic\nPneumonia\n", "cardiology - Is having a congenitally fused heart valve a hereditary condition?": "\nShort answer: Yes. \nFused leaflets?\nThe condition you\u2019re referring to is known as Congenital bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). It is the most common congenital heart valve abnormality, present in 1-2% of live births. Normally there are three leaflets (a.k.a. cusps) comprising the aortic valve. BAV refers to the situation when there are only two cusps, a hemodynamically less favorable scenario. \nAlthough generally benign in itself, BAV has been associated with an increased risk of several serious complications. In particular, aortic stenosis, a condition in which the blood flow exiting the heart is limited by a narrowed valve, is more common in individuals with BAV and often occurs at a younger age. Aortic stenosis in BAV patients is also frequently accompanied by aortic insufficiency, back flow through the valve. Both properties reflect the anatomic descriptor you give: ugly.\nIs BAV hereditary?\nYes. This can be demonstrated by looking at familial clustering of the condition. In one study, the researchers started with thirty patients diagnosed by echocardiography with congenital BAV.* All first-degree relatives were contacted, and 90% of them agreed to undergo echocardiography. Of those, 9% were found to have BAV. This is significantly higher than the baseline population risk (~1%). The distribution was compatible with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance.\nA more recent study used fancy math to determine the heritability of BAV.** They found that 89% of the risk for BAV is due to heritable factors. \n\n\n*This paper is available in full for free and provides a nice review of the background (summarized here) as well as the findings I presented: \n \n\nHuntington K, Hunter AG, Chan KL.

In this case, it doesn't matter which order you put it on. (Especially since they are being stored in an area where anyone walking by can contaminate them).\nYou will also most likely be asked to remove jackets/backpacks and other items and leave them either outside, or in the intermediate dressing area if provided.\nIf the patient is immuno compromised to the point where they are worried about what you might be bringing in, then there will be a very different set of isolation precautions, and you either won't be allowed in, or they will walk you through the washing/garb donning procedures and assist you.\n", "dermatology - Does the usage of sunscreen cause skin cancer?": "\nThe potential health risks of sunscreen include:\n\nThe absence of UVA filters combined with a longer exposure time of the sunscreen user1995, 2005, 2007, 2007.\nSuppression of the skin's production of melanin, a natural broad-spectrum photoprotectant1995, 2004.\nSkin penetration (free radical generation) by sunscreen chemicals1996, 1997, 2006, 2007.\nCytotoxic and carcinogenic effects of nanoparticles (zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) toxicity) 1999.\nHowever TGA study from 2006 (PDF) concluded:\n\nThere is evidence from isolated cell experiments that zinc oxide and titanium dioxide can induce free radical formation in the presence of light and that this may damage these cells (photo-mutagenicity with zinc oxide). However, this would only be of concern in people using sunscreens if the zinc oxide and titanium dioxide penetrated into viable skin cells. The weight of current evidence is that they remain on the surface of the skin and in the outer dead layer (stratum corneum) of the skin.\n\nDNA damage causing skin cancer (carcinogenic effects of sunscreen ingredients related to vitamin A)2012. Read below.\nVitamin D deficiency2002, 2002, 2007.\n\nThe strong promotion of limiting sunlight exposure because of increased risk of skin cancer has resulted in the widespread use of sunscreens. Although sunscreens are very beneficial in reducing skin damage to excessive exposure to sunlight, they also can markedly reduce the photosynthesis of vitamin D3 in the skin.\nWhen used properly a sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 8 reduces the skin's ability to produce vitamin D3 by 97.5%Holick 2002.\n\nOxybenzone (benzophenone-3) toxicity concerns.\n\nThe CDC study from 2008 reveals that 97% of Americans are contaminated with a widely-used sunscreen ingredient called oxybenzone that has been linked to allergies, hormone disruption, and cell damage.\nEWG research shows that 84% of 910 name-brand sunscreen products offer inadequate protection from the sun, or contain ingredients, like oxybenzone, with significant safety concerns. Although oxybenzone is most common in sunscreen, companies also use the chemical in at least >500 other personal care products.\nChemical was detected in the urine of nearly every study participant. Typically, women and girls had higher levels of oxybenzone in their bodies than men and boys, likely a result of differences in use of body care products including sunscreens.\nA companion study released a day earlier revealed that mothers with high levels of oxybenzone in their bodies were more likely to give birth to underweight baby girls (Wolff 2008).\n\n\nRetinyl palmitate (vitamin A palmitate) controversy\nThe FDA's NCTR and NTP in 2009 posted on the NTP website data from FDA\u2019s long-term photocarcinogenicity tests of retinyl palmitate on UV-exposed laboratory animals. In the studies, high doses of topical retinyl palmitate (a form of vitamin A) were shown to accelerate cancer (skin tumors or lesions) in lab animals that grew significantly faster than mice treated with vitamin-free cream (NTP 2009).\n\nSource: EWG analysis of data from FDA photocarcinogenicity study of retinyl palmitate (NTP 2009). Percent decreases in time to development of a significant tumor or lesion (for animals exposed to cream laced with retinyl palmitate) are relative to that for animals exposed to cream free of the compound.\nScientists have known for some time that retinyl palmitate can spur excess skin growth (hyperplasia), and that in sunlight it can form free radicals that damage DNA (NTP 2000).\nPrevious data were preliminary, however in 2011 the link between retinyl palmitate (RP), sunlight and the increased risk of cancer has been confirmed by the National Toxicology Program after a year long study on mice.\nThe EWG and and New York Senator Chuck Schumer have called attention to the fact that high doses of topical retinyl palmitate were shown to accelerate cancer in lab animals and EWG published the following statement (which was scheduled for immediate release):\n\nA key independent science advisory panel has voted to confirm federal researchers' conclusion that retinyl palmitate, a form of vitamin A found in two-fifths of U.S. sunscreens, speeds the development of skin tumors and lesions when applied to the skin in the presence of sunlight.\n\"A compound that causes skin damage and tumors on sun-exposed skin has no place in sunscreens or other daytime skin products,\" said Jane Houlihan, EWG senior vice president for research.\nMore than 200 sunscreens from 44 companies listed vitamin A or retinyl palmitate on their labels in 2010, according to EWG's analysis of beach and sport sunscreens with SPF ratings of 15 or higher.\nIn light of those findings, EWG recommends that manufacturers of cosmetics, sunscreens and other personal care products remove retinyl palmitate from all products to be used on sun-exposed skin and that consumers avoid buying products that contain this chemical.\n\nDespite of that sunscreen controversy, another study from 2010 by JAAD determined that \"there is no convincing evidence to support the notion that [retinyl palmitate] in sunscreens is carcinogenic.\". Therefore EWG  has since refuted this analysis directly(2011).\nA panel of independent scientists convened by the NTP in January 2011 unanimously confirmed the study\u2019s conclusion that retinyl palmitate \u201cenhanced the photocarcinogenic activity\u201d of sunlight (NTP 2011).\n\nThe strong scientific consensus that has formed around the NTP-FDA vitamin A study has afforded the FDA an exceptional opportunity to take a bold public health stand on a cosmetic ingredient that has proven harmful in multiple studies(2011).\n\nSince then the FDA has set a minimum performance standard for sunscreens that use the term \u201cbroad spectrum\u201d to denote that they provide a measure of protection from ultraviolet-A rays.\nThe most recent government scientific study from August 2012 by NTP has demonstrated that retinyl palmitate speeds photo-carcinogenic effects on test animals and concluded that diisopropyl adipate increased incidence of skin tumors in mice, and the addition of either retinoic acid or retinyl palmitate both exacerbated the rate and frequency of tumors(2012),(PDF). The study (Photococarcinogenesis Study Of Retinoic Acid And Retinyl Palmitate) was conducted at a federal research center co-hosted by the FDA and NTP, found that mice treated with small doses of retinyl palmitate and ultraviolet light developed skin tumors faster than untreated, light-exposed mice or those treated only with a control cream. There were more numerous tumors on every animal treated with retinyl palmitate.\nAnd the conclusion was:\n\nUnder the conditions of these studies, the topical treatment of SKH-1 mice with the control cream resulted in earlier onsets of in-life skin lesions and higher incidences and multiplicities of in-life skin lesions, when compared to untreated controls, in the absence and presence of SSL.\n\n\nThis graphic presents skin tumor onset data for female and male mice exposed to the amount of UV light equivalent to 30 percent of the UV dose that causes sunburn in people. The bottom axis indicates weeks of retinyl palmitate + light treatment. (NTP 2010).\nThe sunscreen industry and its paid consultants have rejected the NTP findings.\nWhether RP in sunscreens is carcinogenic is a controversial issue for the cosmetics industry and FDA is reviewing data from several studies since July 2009. Nearly 33 years after it began considering regulation of sunscreen products, the FDA has yet to review or certify the safety of chemicals formulated into sunscreen products.\nEWG supports FDA\u2019s proposal for further testing to determine the potential phototoxicity and/or photocarcinogenicity of diisopropyl adipate. However, more tests are likely to take some years with detailed toxicity testing with action to remove harmful ingredients from body care products. And until the government takes decisive action, consumers can have no confidence that the regulatory system for sunscreens and cosmetics is screening out suspect ingredients.\nSee also:\n\nWhat scientists say about Vitamin A in sunscreen at EWG\nPotential health risks of sunscreen at Wikipedia\nRetinyl palmitate (vitamin A palmitate) at Wikipedia\nSunscreen: Potential risks at Wikipedia\nDoes sun screen cause cancer? at Skeptics SE\nIs there a health risk from nanoparticles in sunscreens? at Skeptics SE\n2010: Possible link between ingredient in sunscreen and skin cancer: Schumer at NY Daily\n2010 article: Retinyl palmitate sunscreen and skin safety\n2011 article: New study links retinyl palmitate to cancer\n\n", "nutrition - Side effects of genetically modified food products": "\nGM food topic is controversial and it's subject of protests, vandalism, referenda, legislation, court action and scientific disputes and this involve consumers, biotechnology companies, governmental regulators, non-governmental organizations and scientists.\nThe main concerns about GM (genetic modified) food and crops is whether they have any negative effects on our health and the environment. And before implementation of these new GM strategies, we should take a full risk assessment which is necessary to understand the possible impacts.\nTransgenesis of food organisms is likely to grow further and used in the world food supply.\nGenetic engineering and breeding has aim of building plants that are superior (\"superweeds\" and \"superbugs\") which holds great promise.\nGM crops (such as corn, soybean, rapeseed and cotton) already been produced a range of GM characters such as:\n\nresistance to certain viral pathogens (cucumber mosaic virus), insect, pests, diseases (citrus greening disease) or environmental conditions,\nreduction of spoilage,\nresistance to chemical treatments (e.g. herbicide),\nenhancing yields or improved nutritional value,\nmodification of enzymes involved in bioprocessing2006, 2007,\naltering oil content,\ntomato - delayed fruit ripening,\nalfalfa - aimed at the reduction of lignin contentwiki,\nand many more\n\nHealth concerns\nHowever some health groups claim that there is potential long-term impact on human health have not been adequately assessed2004,2007, however the broad scientific consensus is that food on the market derived from GM crops poses no greater risk than conventional food2010, 2011, 2012.\nIn general those who create genetically engineered seeds argue the seeds are safe and critics say that FDA has relied on studies the industry paid for in comparison with overseas studies which show increasing signs of concern (e.g. increasing the size of organs in mice).\nThe main concerns raised by BMA (PDF) in 2004 are:\n\nAllergens.\n\nPossible effects of GM foods on allergic responses.\n\nIt\n  remains possible that any new food products could elicit new allergies.\nThere is evidence that the food matrix can affect the release of other\n  nutrients during digestion and it seems likely that it can also influence the release and digestion of\n  allergens in the digestive tract.\nWith regard to sensitisation it is still not known whether other\n  components in the food matrix can have an adjuvant effect on the development of IgE responses in\n  susceptible individuals.\nThe concerns are that they may contain allergenic substances due to introduction of new genes into crops2003.\n\n\nNutritional status2003.\n\nIt is possible that GM technology could lead to unpredicted harmful\n  changes in the nutritional status of foodsMRC 2000.\nGM foods could conceivably have different effects on those of poor nutritional status and/or those belonging to \u2018vulnerable groups\u2019 (notably the foetus, infants, children, pregnant and lactating women, the elderly and those with chronic disease) when compared with healthy individuals.\n\nGenetic transfer.\n\nThe fate of GM plant DNA in the digestive system.\n\nWhile gene transfer has been observed in the gastrointestinal tract of some mammals 1991, 1993 and birds 1999 there is still great uncertainty as to the extent and the consequences of this transfer 2002.\n\nPotential effects on human health resulting from the use of viral DNA in plants.\n\nPlant viral DNA sequences are commonly used in the construction of the genes inserted into GM plants.\nThe concern is that genetic engineering often involves the use of antibiotic-resistance genes as \"selectable markers\" and this could lead to production of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains that are resistant to available antibiotics. This would create a serious public health problem.2003\n\n\nEnvironmental impact.\n\nRecent UK Farm Scale Evaluations of GM herbicide-tolerant\n  crops (GMHT)2003 indicate that if GMHT beet and spring oilseed rape were introduced and managed as they were in the trial, a significant reduction would be expected in weed biomass and weed seed return. This would result in fewer nectar resources for pollinators and fewer weed seed resources for granivorous birds.\nCanadian farmers found that their fields filled with stray GM crop plants known as \u2018volunteers\u2019. These were resistant, not only to the substance against which the main crop was engineered, but to the other two herbicides used as well.2002 \nThe potential impact of GM crops on the environment and biological diversity is the issue that has given rise to most concern and it remains in doubt2003.\n\nExperimental design.\n\nResearch into the possible health effects of GM foods in this country has been limited to date by the lack of firm hypotheses regarding such effects, difficulties of defining individual consumption, and the generally low levels of consumption of GM foods.\n\n\nSome other groups such as Greenpeace and WWF have concerns that risks of GM food have not been adequately identified and managed.\nOne cellular biologist, David Williams, says that anyone in this field knows that genome is not a static environment and can be transformed by several different means, and it can happen generations later which can result in potentially toxic plants slipping through testingD. Williams.\nSome other studies indicated that there may be specific health risks associated with consumption of GM foods, such as:\n\nThe 2005 study by Allergy Asthma Proc. toward assessing the allergenic potential of GMO food.\n\nThe skin test results of 49 patients showed 13 positive results to wild soybeans and 8 positive results to GMO soybeans. One patient had a positive skin test result to GMO soybeans only.\n\nThe 2008 study of biological effects of transgenic maize NK603xMON810 fed in long term reproduction studies in mice.\n\nThe RACB trial showed time related negative reproductive effects of the GM maize under the given experimental conditions. The outcome of this study suggests that future studies on the safety of GM feed and food should include reproduction studies.\n\nStudy in 2007 & 2009 found that MON810\u2019s transgene structure in GM maize used around the world caused liver, kidney, and heart damage in rats, however EFSA reviewed and concluded that the differences observed were within a normal range for control rats and deemed the statistical methods used inappropriate.\n\n\nOther concerns\nPeople questioning this new technology and activists around the world demonstrate to express their concerns while food industries trying to push this technology forward.\nThere are common claims from opponents that consumption of GM can cause cancer or birth defects, however there currently is no evidence to support this claim.\nCurrently labeling of GMO products in the marketplace is required over 60 countries2014, the US does not require this.\n\nConclusion\nBased on above, many unanswered questions remain, especially with potential long-term impact of GM foods on animal and human health and the environment and it currently. The GM foods are very complex and currently there is a lack of evidence-based research with regard to medium/long-effects on health and it remains as a matter of great public concern. Further research is required on how best to carry the experiments (modern profiling techniques and define the 'normal' compositions of conventional plants), risk assessments and surveillance studies with respect to GM crops and foods.\nThe Royal Society in their 2002 report saying there is at present no evidence that GM foods cause allergic reactions, use of\nspecific viral DNA sequences in GM plants are negligible and conclude that consumption poses no significant risk to human health, and that ingestion of GM DNA has no effect.\nStudy from 2003 by J Toxicol Environ Health summarise it:\n\nThe review of available literature indicates that the genetically modified crops available in the market that are intended for human consumption are generally safe; their consumption is not associated with serious health problems. However, because of potential for exposure of a large segment of human population to genetically modified foods, more research is needed to ensure that the genetically modified foods are safe for human consumption.\n\nCurrently the broad scientific consensus states that food on the market derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food2010, 2011, 2012.\n\nFurther readings:\n\nWikipedia\n\nGenetically modified food (GM food)\nGenetically modified crops (GMOs, biotech crops, transgenic plants)\nGenetically modified organism (GMO)\nGenetically modified food controversies\nGenetic engineering (Transgenesis, Cisgenesis, Subgenic)\nPlant breeding: Genetic modification\nDetection of genetically modified organisms\nGM organisms in agriculture:\nGM soybean (controversies: safety),\nGM tomato,\nGM wheat (controversies: safety, ecological, intellectual property law, contamination of the non-GM, etc.),\nGM rice (controversies: safety, should be labeled, intellectual property, contamination of the non-GM, etc.)\nGM alfalfa (and legal issues in the UK),\n\n\n\nGrowers can spray fields of Roundup Ready alfalfa with the glyphosate herbicide and kill the weeds without harming the alfalfa crop.\nAquAdvantage salmon (trade name for GM Atlantic salmon)\n\nConcerns: survival, rate of growth, smoltification, allergenicity, muscle fibers, lack of fertilization, swimming capabilities, decreased sperm velocity\nGM canola\nGM maize (Effects on nontarget insects, Gene flow, corn recalls)\n\nThe Truth about Genetically Modified Food at Scientific American\nAre You Eating Frankenfood? article by Martin Teitel, Ph.D.\nand Kimberly A.

And this doesn't even consider slow-acting problems that might not show up for years or decades. Who decided this was an acceptable risk?\n\n\n", "contraception - What forms of prevention of STIs are there?": "\nThe CDC lists two:  complete abstinence, and being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner.\nSexual intercourse naturally introduces microtears (small tears in the the epithelial layer) through which diseases can transfer between partners.  One might think that additional lubrication would help with this, but the jury is most definitely out on that.\nI think it's pretty safe to say that if there was another clinically verified way of preventing STDs, the CDC would have put it on this list.  (For example, they note that there are specific things you can be vaccinated against, namely hepatitis B and HPV.)  It strains credulity to think that there is a mechanism available that the CDC just forgot to mention there.\nHaving said all of that, I'll just mention the fact that there are a variety of types of condoms.  If you are in a situation where you need to use them (e.g. non abstinent and not in a long term monogamous relationship), you might be able to find a brand or type that works better for you.\nEDIT:  A comment has pointed out that a cervical barrier method can reduce the risk of transmission of certain types of STIs.  Since that does not show up on the CDC list I mentioned, I feel that it's worth bringing up.  By no means is that a \"safe substitute\" for a condom (and I don't think anyone is implying that it is).  However, as a risk reducer, it should be added to the list.\n", "sanitation - In which order to disinfect/wash your hands after going to the toilet in a hospital?": "\nIf you must use both to maximally remove infectious organisms from the hands, it's best to wash hands with soap and water, dry, then apply hand sanitizer and allow to air-dry on the skin. \nThis is because dirt, food, oils, etc. on your hands can make the sanitizers less effective. If you first wash your hands to remove barriers to their effectiveness, the sanitizer will be more useful.\nIn a non-hospital setting, though, it's unnecessary to wash with soap and water and use a hand sanitizer. For the most part, proper hand washing is as good or better than using hand sanitizers at removing bacteria and viruses from your hands.1 \n\nResearch has shown that hand sanitizers can be as effective as hand washing only in certain situations.\n\nThe major problem is that many people don't take the time to thoroughly wash their hands.\nReasons to use both include:\n\n\ncoming in close physical contact with persons at high risk for infection (such as newborns, the very old, the ill, or the immunosuppressed)\nhaving direct physical contact with someone with an upper respiratory infection, skin infection or diarrhea,\nworking in settings where infectious diseases are commonly transmitted, such as food preparation, and/or crowded living areas (child-care centers, preschools, prisons, or chronic-care residences), or\nwhen you're uncertain if the water you're using to wash your hands is drinking-water clean (e.g. after a flood or when you have a \"boil water\" advisory.\n\n\nHow to wash hands properly: 1. Wet hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap. 2. Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Be sure to lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails. 3. Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the \"Happy Birthday\" song from beginning to end twice. 4. Rinse your hands well under clean, running water. 5. If you're using a tap, turn water off with a paper towel. 6. Dry your hands using a clean (new) towel or air dry them.\n1 Hand Hygiene and Hand Sanitizers\nWash Your Hands - CDC\n", "Effect of the common cold on the immune system": "\nI've written on this subject a few times, but the most relevant question ended up being closed, and the other is on Bio.SE, so I will mostly focus on tailoring the information there to the specifics of this question.\nIf you look at ether of my previous answers, you will note the first thing we need to establish is what is causing the common cold.  From the body of evidence coming from the US and China I believe the answer to that is HRV followed by RSV.\nYour immune system is actually directly attacked by two of the proteins RSV makes when it infects cells (NS1 and NS2).  This knowledge is actually linked to a pretty cool vaccine idea for RSV.  Thus I think it quite appropriate to think that active RSV infections weaken your immune system.\nLooking at the very good epidemiology data coming from China (here's another example in addition to the first), it seems that the rate of co-infection, that is something else besides these two viruses infecting the patient, is quite high, particularity with RSV.  This would imply that other pathogens take advantaged of a \"weakened\" immune system in an RSV infection.\nIt's less clear with HRV, but that might just be because of how amazingly common HRV infections are.  It seems as though HRV induces a good immune response, in healthy patients, but it was still commonly found with other pathogens present (though not in rates as high as RSV).  There is not a clear mechanism for HRV if it is in fact weakening the immune system (which actually might be better described as a \"distracted\" immune system in this case).\nAs for what you can do?  Not a whole lot once symptoms show up.  Contrary to whatever ads you may see, even some poor un-blinded trials, taking vitamin C is not going to help after you already have the cold.  Even the prophylactic benefit seems to only be in certain cases, and I want to strongly discourage megadosing vitamin C, which in most cases does nothing helpful (and can cause problems of it's own).\nStaying hydrated is always a good option, as is washing your hands and coughing/sneezing into your elbow to prevent infecting others.  Other than that, you can hope for any of the vaccine candidates currently be researched to actually work, or that one of the small molecule inhibitors (anti-viral drugs) to actually be safe.\n", "computers - How to know whether phrase A causes less stress on my vocal cords than phrase B?": "\nYou produce sound by flowing air through your vocal folds and making them oscillate. More oscillations produce a higher sound frequency, while less oscillations produce a lower sound frequency. \nYou can also alter the shape of your folds and mouth to produce different sounds and words. \nThe above taken into consideration, I'd choose words that cost the least amount of effort to produce. \nFrequencies:\nLow frequencies put less strain (less oscillations) on the folds, however you might need more air flow (lung pressure) to create the volume required for the speech recognition. \nSounds: As far as the altering of the shape of your mouth and vowels goes, I think eventually a certain type of repetitive strain injury could occur depending on often you use the words.\nAlso consider this: if your mouth is closed at rest, try to pronounce: \"up\". Now try the same starting with your mouth opened. In the former case you first need to open your mouth, while in the latter you can start by flowing air. \nLook closely at the amount of effort you have to put into producing a certain word. Depending on your 'natural voice' (having a certain frequency), your lung capacity and your resting position you should decide what feels most comfortable.\nRegarding \"touch\" and \"click\" - \nThe 'ou' in touch tends to have lower frequencies than the 'ick' in click.  Also to connect the 'c' to the 'l' in click you have to move the tip of your tongue to touch right behind your teeth in your upper jaw, whereas this is already the starting position for the 't' in touch.\n", "medications - Topical nifedipine cream and hypotension": "\nNifedipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. As you point out, it is used via oral administration for treatment of hypertension. Its effects are mediated primarily by blocking voltage-dependent calcium channels in the walls of systemic vasculature, causing vasodilation. This has the effect of lowering blood pressure. \nYour question, then, rests on  whether the nifedipine applied topically to the anus will reach the calcium channels in the vasculature. This is: is topical nifedipine systemically absorbed to a clinically relevant extent? \nThe answer, based on the research I can find, is no. This was explored directly in a study1: Serum levels and possible haemodynamic effects following anorectal application of an ointment containing nifedipine and lignocaine : a study in healthy volunteers. The authors used 3 g of an ointment containing 0.3% w/w2 nifedipine, applied twice daily for 7 days. Serum levels of nifedipine were below the below the limits of quantification, consistent with therapeutically negligible concentrations. Mean blood pressure was not changed when compared to baseline.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n1. Perrotti P1, Grumetto L, Barbato F, Antropoli C. Clin Drug Investig. 2006;26(8):459-67.

This is due to a number of factors:\n\nSolubility. Water-soluble nutrients (like Vitamin B, C) are highly prone to leach out if cooking in water2 (boiling, for example). Fat-soluble nutrients are at a similar risk when cooking in a fat medium or when the fat is lost in the process (e.g., frying, grilling)5.\nHeat. Both fat- and water-soluble nutrients are susceptible to heat from any cooking source, while mineral nutrients are less so5. \nDuration. Methods with shorter cook times (e.g., stir-frying, blanching, microwaving) reduce the effects of heat degradation because the food is not exposed to heat for as long5.\n\n(It's not even always a loss: some nutrients are more available after cooking, because heat breaks down thick cell walls that our digestive system has trouble with, which means that the nutrients are easier for our bodies to uptake3.)\nEach cooking method has a different combination of the above factors, and so has different effects on nutrients in food. Microwave cooking has the advantage of not cooking in water, and being able to reach a higher heat in a shorter time. Depending on the food, this means that microwaving is sometimes better at preserving nutrients. For example, boiling spinach causes a much higher loss (77% vs. almost none) of folate compared to microwaving4.\nOf course, when people make claims about microwaved food being less healthy, they are usually referring to a fear that the act of microwave heating (dielectric heating) is 'unnatural' in some way, or is subjecting the food to dangerous radiation (which may then be ingested). This is simply not supported9 by scientific literature, which indicates that microwave ovens, when used properly, are safe and effective -- with two caveats:\n\nHuman milk. The CDC6 does not recommend heating human milk in the microwave, because of the risk of uneven heating of the liquid (which could scald a baby), and because there is some evidence7 that it decreases its anti-infective properties.\nSuperheating of liquids. If water is heated in a microwave in a smooth container, it can pose a risk of scalding due to superheating9. From wikipedia:\n\nSuperheating can occur when an undisturbed container of water is heated in a microwave oven. When the container is removed, the water still appears to be below the boiling point. However, once the water is disturbed, some of it violently flashes to steam, potentially spraying boiling water out of the container. [...] There are ways to prevent superheating in a microwave oven, such as putting a popsicle stick in the glass or using a scratched container.\n\n\nIn conclusion, microwaving food is a safe alternative to cooking via other methods9. Any cooking method will decrease the nutritional value of food, but this is usually an acceptable tradeoff because of the benefits gained from cooking5. Microwaves do not cause food to be radioactive or acutely dangerous in any way.\nReferences\n\nDoes Cooking Food Reduce the Vitamin Content? - SFGate\nDoes cooking vegetables diminish their nutrients? - HowStuffWorks\nFact or Fiction: Raw veggies are healthier than cooked ones - Scientific American\nThe Claim: Microwave Ovens Kill Nutrients in Food - New York Times\nThe Why, How and Consequences of cooking our food - European Food Information Council\nProper Handling and Storage of Human Milk - Centers for Disease Control\nEffects of microwave radiation on anti-infective factors in human milk - Quan R, Yang C, Rubinstein S, Lewiston NJ, Sunshine P, Stevenson DK, Kerner JA Jr. Pediatrics. 1992 Apr;89(4 Pt 1):667-9.\nSuperheating: Occurrence via microwave oven - Wikipedia\nMicrowave Oven Radiation - U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n\n", "pain - Gamekeeper's thumb - long term healing": "\n\"Gamekeeper's thumb\" - named because of the chronic injury incurred when rabbit keepers broke rabbits' necks between the base of the thumb and index finger - has more recently been referred to as \"skier's thumb\", now the most common acute mechanism of the injury.  If you fell on an outstretched hand hyperextending your thumb (did it feel as if the thumb was stressed beyond its normal range of motion?) and your doctor was correct, you injured the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) of the thumb. This would cause significant pain and swelling at the base of the thumb in the \"web space\" between thumb and index finger.\n \nAs you can see in the picture on the right, the UCL appears partially torn. If it does not heal completely, it can result in an insufficiency of that ligament. In this case, the condition not uncommonly becomes chronic because of repeated injury to the already weakened UCL. It causes varying degrees of instability of that joint with pain and weakness of the pincer grasp (imagine squeezing an m&m between your thumb and your index finger.)\nInitial treatment to optimize ligament healing is immobilization.\nWhat can you do now? If you think you re-injured it, you can apply a cold pack (e.g. a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a dry washcloth) to the thumb as tolerated for ~20 minutes, up to four times per day. \nImmobilizing the thumb with a bulky, loose ACE wrap or a commercially available thumb brace in the neutral position will help lessen the pain.\nYou can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain relief if you have no contraindications*.\nThe best thing you can do is see a doctor (perhaps an orthopedist or a hand specialist would be wise), since chronic pain and instability of the thumb is not insignificant. They can do a thorough evaluation of your thumb\nand either splint/cast your thumb, give you rehabilitative exercises to help you strengthen your thumb, or recommend surgery if necessary.\n*Contraindication = any reason you shouldn't take it.\nAlways keep a cloth between your skin and the ice pack, and press firmly against all the curves of the affected area. Remove the ice pack if it causes pain, and don't fall asleep with the pack in place.\nGamekeeper's Thumb\nGamekeeper's Thumb: Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics\n", "pediatrics - Does sugar cause children to become hyperactive?": "\nThis is a hot topic, and I don\u2019t think there is a firm consensus in the child psychiatry world about the answer. I think a good summary of the literature would leave you with: \n\nX, Y, and Z studies showed an association; \u03a7, \u03a8, and \u03a9 studies showed no association.\n\nExcellent. \u0399n lieu of that, I'm going to use one study to illustrate a couple methodological points to show you why this answer is difficult to know. My goal is to help the reader develop a skeptical eye when research of this type is presented.\nOne study used teacher questionnaires about hyperactivity symptoms and student questionnaires about dietary habits to see if a relationship existed between high sugar intake and hyperactivity. They found that children were at statistically higher risk for ADHD if they consumed:  \n\nless sugar from fruit snacks  \nlow Vitamin C \n\nHowever, the total simple sugar intake did not correlate with hyperactivity symptoms.\nThis makes very little sense. Why should fruit snacks be different from other sugar, and where did Vitamin C come from?\n\nStatistical noise. Data interpretation relies on a ratio of signal:noise to find the signal (in this case, an association). A 5-second brainstorm will bring to mind dozens of unrelated (to usual dietary patterns) topics that may affect what students write down on questionnaires: literacy, gender, upbringing, vocabulary, organization, memory, day-of-the-week, recent holidays, who won the Red Sox game, etc. etc. etc. Some of these may reflect recent dietary patterns that skew the memory of usual dietary patterns; others simply affect the accuracy of report. One could generate an equally diverse list of factors that may affect teacher reports. Either way, the result is the same: a noisy signal.\nConfounding. A confound exists when an extraneous factor exists that correlates with both the independent (dietary report) and the dependent (inattentiveness) variable. In this case, one could imagine that students who tend to be careless about reporting might also be those displaying symptoms of hyperactivity (which tends to run with inattentiveness). It\u2019s not obvious whether that would lead to under or over reporting of sugar intake. \nGenerally, obvious confounders can be adjusted for statistically (here, I don't see that they did much of that, although they did do separate analyses for boys vs girls). However, no amount of math can adjust for factors that aren\u2019t measured. There was no \u201ccarelessness independent of hyperactivity\u201d score obtained here, and we couldn\u2019t expect it \u2014 it\u2019s a basically unknowable parameter. Certain confounders are inherent to the methodology. Math never fixes this.\nMultiple comparisons. The basic principle is: if you look at enough factors, something is going to be statistically associated with something else for reasons that have nothing to do with reality. That\u2019s because we define statistical significance as a result that would occur by chance <5% of the time. If you run 20 tests, you have a good chance of coming up with one of them that appears to be positive simply by chance. In data that has a low signal:noise ratio (see #1), this problem is all the more apparent. This is something to think about when unexpected results pop up from a study that was designed to look at something completely different.

The study that everyone seems to point to was conducted in 1973, where they fed sugar in 100g doses to people and measured the effect on phagocytosis (where immune cells engulf invader bacteria to destroy it).\nThe end result was that sugar intake did appear to suppress the ability of the immune system to destroy invading bacteria. This function was suppressed for up to 5 hours in control subjects, while fasting comparisons did not have the same effect. Additionally, they counted the number of neutrophils (type of white blood cells), and they were not diminished, which suggests it was a function blocking mechanism, not that it suppressed the number. So it does limit the effectiveness, but this is not really a suppression of the system.\nPart of this may be due to the sugar molecule being structurally similar to Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid), and that it competes for the space and prevents the cells from effectively using Vitamin C to destroy bacteria. (Based off studies Linus Pauling did, but I could not find the study, merely references to it).\nThere are suggestions that sugar also may contribute to insulin resistence, and that it may contribute to increased inflammation, but these either state more study is needed or are in the incidence of specific other deficiencies (Such as magnesium).\n", "nausea - Do cars with automatic transmission tend to make passengers less car sick than cars with manual transmission?": "\nIn order to understand this claim you have to first understand what causes car sickness in the first place. What is basically happening is the motion you sense with your inner ear is different from the motion you are visualizing. This is easily caused by motions that you sense with your body that you can't see with your eyes or that you can't anticipate. This is most common in cars when people are doing other activity while riding in them such as readying a book or playing on an electronic device. It is generally not an issue for the driver since they are in control and able to anticipate everything.\nAs to your question the there really isn't any difference in the motion of an automatic car and a manual car as when driven properly there will be no noticeable changes in motion when shifting gears. I would chalk that site up to an advertisement for selling cars with an automatic transmission as it just seems to talk about how an automatic transmission is better then a manual. \nIf you look around online you will find claims that both an automatic and a manual are better for preventing carsickness.\nAs a side note there is talk about how driver less cars might make carsickness worse for some people as it will take away the advantages that are gained from driving.\nhttp://www.medicinenet.com/motion_sickness_sea_sickness_car_sickness/article.htm\n", "nutrition - Which herbal teas have been proven to energize?": "\nThe most clearly effective stimulating (energizing) herbs have run into legal restrictions, at least in the United States. The most notorious is the leaf of the E. coca tree, which contains cocaine. Another stimulating herb more recently banned is Catha edulis (Khat) which contains cathinone. The chemically similar stimulant ephedrine is the active constituent of Ephedra sinica (Mormon Tea), which has had sales restricted in recent years. Ephedra is used instead of black tea (Camellia sinensis) by Mormons because of their restriction against consuming caffeine. Psychedelics like mecsaline found in the common San Pedro cactus (Trichocereus pachanoi), or ibogaine in Tabernanthe iboga, tend to be stimulating at doses below the psychedelic dose but are technically illegal to make tea from.\nStimulating herbs which have been legally ignored tend to have unwanted side effects, at least in comparison with caffeine. The bark of Pausinystalia yohimbe contains the adrenergic stimulant yohimbine, commonly marketed as a sex enhancer. Herbs like Nux vomica, which contains the convulsive stimulant strychnine, is certainly available, especially as rat poison. Species containing ketones like camphor (Cinnamomum camphora) and thujone (Artemisia absinthium - the key ingredient wormwood used in absinthe) are said to be toxic but stimulating.\nMany other herbs have been promoted as stimulating, sedating, etc., without there being clear proof that they are more than placebos. I believe I have tried all the herbs in your list of suggestions but didn't notice any stimulating or other effects from them. Ginseng is commonly claimed to be stimulating but I haven't noticed any effect.\n", "nutrition - How can I boost my immune system?": "\nAs far as I am aware, the immune system does not have a \"boosted\" state. There is a medical doctor, Mark Crislip, who wrote a post about this on Science-based medicine, and I'll cite here the most pertinent lines. Even though he takes a very one-sided position, I personally find his writing convincing, and the whole article is worth reading. It makes many more points I'm leaving out here. \n\nWhat does that mean: boost the immune system? Most people apparently think that the immune system is like a muscle, and by working it, giving it supplements and vitamins,  the immune system will become stronger. [...] The other popular phrase is \u201csupport\u201d. \nThe immune system, if you are otherwise healthy, cannot be boosted\nIf you google the phrase \u201cboost the immune system\u201d you will find over 288,000 pages that give advice on how to give that old immune system a lift. Curiously, a Pubmed search with the same phase yields 1100 references, most concerning vaccination. If you Pubmed \u2018enhanced immune system\u2019 you get 41,000 references mostly concerning immunology. None of the references concern taking a normal person and making the immune system work better than its baseline to prevent or treat infection\nThose who say that that their product, for example probiotics, boost the immune system, point to studies such as these that show that in response to bacteria, cells of the immune system are activated [...] They call it boosting. I call it the inflammatory response.\n\nThe article then goes on to cite several studies which found that being constantly subject to inflammatory response has several ill effects on health. \nHe does admit that you need to be otherwise healthy (by following what he calls \"kindergarten advice\" of eating healthy, getting enough sleep and exercise) to have an immune system working at its baseline. So maybe you could say that, if your immune system is running at reduced \"strength\" due to increased stress, you could \"boost\" it by reducing your stressors. But this does not mean that, if you are stressed and consume probiotics or other presumably boosting products, you'll somehow get to the baseline. Also, I share Crislip's view here: it would be misleading to call it boosting when it's simply being returned to its standard state. \n\nThere is another possible meaning of \"boost the immune system\" which does have a basis in fact. If you get a vaccine against a certain disease, you are not exposed to a constant inflammatory response, but you will be able to fight off this one disease better. I was not going to post it here, as this is not the sense usually meant in marketing materials. But the first tip in the first link you gave said \"get a flu vaccine\", so I thought it's worth mentioning. It will not have any effect on other aspects of your health. \n", "dentistry - How frequently should non-alcoholic mouthwashes be used?": "\nYou don't need at all to use any mouthwash. A healthy mouth is full of bacteria, almost all of them beneficial for our health, and \n\nThere is no evidence so far of any long term preventive effect of any kind of mouthwash, only trials with transient effects (< one year) or 6 months in surrogate clinical endpoints as number of bacteria and gingivitis. The only one with some evidence are fluoridated-based mouthwashes, but you get the same effect if you don't spit after brushing with fluoridated toothpaste; \nIf you still decide to use, the only risk is the staining and metallic taste from chlorhexidine-based mouthwashes. There is no evidence so far of risk of oral cancer associated with the use of essential oil\u2013containing mouthrinses.\n\nInstead, you may invest your money in cheese for your oral health. \nLastly, if you are interested in joining a study to increase our limited knowledge about mouthrinses for oral health, there are some trials recruiting.\nSo, in brief: daily use of fluoridated toothpaste without spitting after using it is enough if you already are eating enough fruits and vegetables and limiting the consumption of sugar.\n", "How can I stop mouth breathing while I sleep?": "\nYes, you can get a full face mask and then it wont matter if you are breathing through your mouth or not.

Hemoglobin is a coloured pigment which binds to oxygen and carries it across the body. It binds to oxygen at a place where there is high oxygen tension (for example, lungs) and release it at a place where there is low oxygen tension (such as the tissues). Iron atoms exist as Fe2+ within the hemoglobin molecules. When oxygen is added to those atoms, they bind to the iron and this prevents the oxygen from leaving it. Oxygen only leaves the iron when it reaches the tissues. So basically you need iron to carry oxygen across the body, because iron (in hemogloobin) is the oxygen carrier.\nIf a person have a high oxygen requirement at the tissues (such as an athlete), then the body looks to produce more red blood cells (within which the hemoglobin recides) so that it can increase the overall oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. So in order to do that, the body needs needs more iron. So atheletes needs to take more iron because\n\nThere is a progressively increasing need for more hemoglobin\nThere is a need to maintain the large red blood cell mass that are already existing\n\nRBCs die after their life span of 120 days. So there is a constant rate of RBC production and killing of them. And then there is iron loss from body in various forms. The body has a store of iron (in liver). So if there is not enough supply of iron (as in pure vegetarians who does not take proper amount of green leafy vegetables), then the body will start utilising those iron stores. When the stores are over, then the body will start exhibiting symptoms of iron deficiency. In order to solve that deficiency, various iron preparations can be prescribed, and Iron tablets are only one of them. \nSo as I had described, athletes may need a higher iron supply than normal people. In addition to that, there are other people too, who need higher iron input in their diet:\n\nPregnant women (they are prescribed iron and folic acid tablets during gestation)\nMenstruating women (there is monthly blood loss, and hence iron loss)\nGrowing children (constantly increasing RBC mass, and other growth demands)\nPeople with problems in iron absorption\nPeople living in the mountains\n\nIf there is a need to supplement, that can be done using the iron preparations I was talking about. Out of all ingested iron, at most 10-20% is only absorbed. However, the beauty of the human iron metabolism is that it is strongly regulated. Body will only absorb iron if it is needed. If there is adequate iron in the body already, then the absorption mechanisms are downregulated. However, in overdose, these mechanisms are deranged and hence there will be over absorption. This occurs more commonly in pediatric age groups who accidentally consumes excess of iron tablets. In those patients the iron gets accumulated in blood (and not in the RBCs are hemoglobin) and harms the cells by various ways. The only way for body to get rid of excess iron is by loss of red blood cells.

So shampooing in the modern sense (water to produce a soapy lather) is only about 100 years old.\nOur modern shampoos are a combination of surfactants (such as SLS) which dissolve natural oils (sebum) and remove dirt particles. As result, it reduces the natural oils in your hair and scalp making it drier than usual, causing the scalp to produce more oil to compensate.\nAccording to some dermatologists, a gradual reduction in shampoo causes sebaceous glands to produce sebum at a slower rate resulting in less oil on the scalp and in the hair2009.\nMichelle Hanjani, a dermatologist at Columbia University explains:\n\nIf you wash your hair every day, you're removing the sebum, then the oil glands compensate by producing more oil\"\n\nShe recommends that patients wash their hair no more than two or three times a week.\nIn the 2010 book Packing for Mars, Soviet research said2010:\n\nthe skin halts its production of sebum\u2014after five to seven days of not bathing\n\nHowever this could vary greatly from person to person, as some people could respond better to some products with different concentrations of surfactants.\nFor example if you have \"oily hair\" you need a higher concentration of SLS to help dissolve the oils, when you have \"dry and frizzy hair\", it would exacerbate the problem.\nIn 2007 radio audition, Australian Richard Glover decided to challenge his audience to go without shampoo for six weeks. 86 percent of those who 500 people who participated reported that \"their hair was either better or the same\"wiki.\nStudies\nA study from 1997 showed a link between excessive oil production and anti-dandruff shampoos containing selenium sulfide.\n\nStudy was conducted in 120 men in order to quantify the effect of eight proprietary antidandruff shampoos on sebum flow dynamic.\nTwo shampoos exhibited a significant effect upon the sebum follicular reservoir, steadily increasing the sebum excretion rate in time. One other product induced a significant decrease in sebum output.\nOnly a few topical products are known to decrease the sebum output at the skin surface:\nAmong them, the effect of progesterone, astringents, erythromycin-zinc complex, corticosteroids, and elubiol have been documented.\n\nFor older studies, see: 1968, 1983\nIn 2013, the FDA announced that triclosan was found to affect hormone levels in animalsFDA.\n\nAnimal studies have shown that triclosan alters hormone regulation. However, data showing effects in animals don\u2019t always predict effects in humans.\n\nA recent study from 2014 showed that shampooing impact on cortisol levels in human hair:\n\nChemical processing and frequent shampooing affect cortisol levels measured in hair. Chemically processed or excessively shampooed hair should be avoided when recruiting subjects for hair cortisol studies.\n\nBased on above it seems that chemical properties in modern shampoos can affect our hormones, however more studies needs to be conducted to see how exactly it affects our natural oil production (sebum).\nRead more:\n\nDitching shampoo a dirty little beauty secret at NBC\nWhen It Comes To Shampoo, Less Is More at NPR\nOf Course I Washed My Hair Last Year\nCurly Girl by Michele Bender (2002)\nNo poo (no shampoo) at Wikipedia\n\n", "treatment options - Is there any proof that acupuncture is an effective pain remedy?": "\ntl;dr\nCurrent research seems to indicate that the brain is responding to anticipation or visual stimulus of needles being inserted, not that any of the theories supporting acupuncture are correct.\n\nSteven Novella reviewed the following article:\nChae Y, Lee IS, Jung WM, Park K, Park HJ, Wallraven C. Psychophysical and neurophysiological responses to acupuncture stimulation to incorporated rubber hand. Neurosci Lett. 2015 Feb 11;591C:48-52. doi: 10.1016/j.neulet.2015.02.025. \nI'm going to quote from Novella's review because it's easier for a lay person to read/understand, and I don't have full access to the paper.\nAs background, he states:\n\nThere have been in total several thousand clinical studies looking at the apparent effects of acupuncture. These have failed to convincingly reject the null hypothesis, meaning that they have not demonstrated a clear biological response to acupuncture for any indication. The better controlled studies consistently show that needle location does not matter (sham acupuncture), and that needle insertion does not matter (placebo acupuncture). You can literally have a non-acupuncturist randomly poke someone with toothpicks and get the same response as the full acupuncture treatment.\n\nAnd described the current paper:\n\nA recent study looked at performing acupuncture on a phantom limb.\n  They used a now well-established technique of tricking the brain into\n  incorporating a dummy body part as if it were real. They placed\n  subjects in front of a table so that one of their arms was below the\n  table, with a rubber arm above the table placed in such a way that\n  visually the rubber arm looked like their own arm. They then stroke\n  the rubber arm and the subjects real arm simultaneously. The brain\n  sees and feels the rubber arm being stroked, and this sensory feedback\n  is often enough for the brain to create the sensation of ownership\n  over the rubber arm.\nThe researchers then placed acupuncture needles into the rubber arm\n  that subjects had incorporated as their own. Obviously there is no\n  possibility of any physiological response from the needle penetrating\n  the rubber arm. I further think it is reasonable to conclude that\n  placing a needle into a rubber arm cannot activate acupuncture points\n  (if they existed) or alter Qi (if it existed). This experiment nicely\n  eliminates local physiological responses and any Qi responses to the\n  needles.\nThe researchers performed functional MRI scanning (fMRI) on subjects\n  while needles were placed in their phantom rubber limbs. Keep in mind\n  that fMRI research involves collecting lots of data and aggregating\n  it. So the researchers are not looking at brain reactions in real\n  time, just the aggregate brain activity of many subjects over many\n  trials. They then look for statistical associations in the activity.\nWhat they found was the same brain activation that previous studies\n  have found with acupuncture of real limbs.\n\nWhen the rubber hand was fully incorporated with the real body,\n    acupuncture stimulation to the rubber hand resulted in the experience\n    of the DeQi sensation as well as brain activations in the dorsolateral\n    prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), insula, secondary somatosensory cortex\n    (SII), and medial temporal (MT) visual area. The insular activation\n    was associated with the DeQi sensation from the rubber hand.\n\nIf these results hold up, this implies that the brain is simply\n  responding to the expectation and visualization of the needle\n  penetration. Actual needle penetration is unnecessary. The most\n  parsimonious interpretation of this data is that acupuncture is all in\n  the mind. There is no need to hypothesize the existence of Qi,\n  acupuncture points, or a specific physiological mechanism for\n  acupuncture.\nThere are plenty of studies that show that the perception of pain is\n  easily manipulated by simple things such as distraction. Swearing,\n  distorting body image, and crossing your arms while one of them is\n  pricked will all reduce pain perception. Pain perception is closely\n  tied to attention, and so simple distraction is effective. It\u2019s no\n  surprise, therefore, that the brain responds to phantom stimulation.\nAt the very least this study demonstrates that all prior studies\n  looking at fMRI responses to acupuncture needle insertion were likely\n  simply showing a non-specific brain response to the expectation and/or\n  visualization of needle insertion, without the need to invoke any\n  specific physiological responses.\n\n", "Implications of repeated low level head impact?": "\nIn March, journal \"Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience\" published three reviews in Article in Press -section related directly to this topic (Ling et al. 2015, Daneshvar et al. 2015, Gardner and Yaffe 2015).\nThere is major epidemiological evidence stating the association between moderate or traumatic brain injury (TBI) and neurogenerative diseases such as Alzheimers (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD) (Gardner and Yaffe 2015). \nThere are several studies investigating association between one time MTBI and dementia. Schofield and co-coworkers stated \"Incident Alzheimer's disease was significantly associated with head injury which occurred within the preceding 30 years\" (Schofield et al. 1997). There have been many recent studies in this topic. Lee et al. stated \"TBI is an independent significant risk factor of developing dementia even in the mild type\" (Lee al al. 2013). Nordstr\u00f6n et al. stated \"In the present study, we found strong associations between YOD (young onset dementia) of non-AD forms and TBIs of different severity\" (Nordstr\u00f6m et al. 2014).\nAll these studies are cited in recent literature review in which authors state \"Taken together, these studies suggest that there is likely a small, but significant, risk of dementia following a single MTBI that is not solely due to reverse-causation or confounding. It is likely, however, that younger adults may be more resilient or may take longer to develop dementia than older adults who sustain a MTBI\" (Gardner and Yaffe 2015).  \nCTE (Chronic traumatic encephalopathy) is a neurogenerative disease linked to exposure to repetitive MTBI (Wikipedia). CTE has been associated with mood, behavior, cognitive, and/or motor symptoms (including parkinsonism and/or motor neuron disease). CTE is officially a postmortem diagnosis. Prevalance of CTE among former professional American football players have ranged from 50% to 97%. In one study stage of CTE was associated to years of football exposure, \"lending weight to a true causal association\" (Gardner and Yaffe 2015). \nAs so there is mounting evidence of the association between (repetitive) MTBI and neurogenerative diseases but there are many epidemiological (\"secular trends\",\"reverse-causation\") and study protocol related (clinical criteria for CTE, quantification of MTBI) issues which warrant further research in this topic. Authors of the recent review state \"Recently, large epidemiological studies have reported that MTBI and repetitive MTBI are also significant risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, but these associations are not yet aswell established and require further replication\" (Gardner and Yaffe 2015).  \n", "hearing - Does the *frequency* of loud sounds one is exposed to affect Tinnitus risk?": "\nDifferent hairs cells in inner ear (cochlea) vibrate in various ways in respond to different sound frequencies.\n\nSmall temporary changes or damages in the outer hair cells of the cochlea can trigger the emergence of tinnitus by increasing the gain of the central auditory system2004.\nMost patients (both tinnitus and hearing loss) reports that the frequency of the tinnitus correlates with the severity and frequency characteristics of their hearing loss and that intensity of the tinnitus is usually less than 10dB above the patient's hearing threshold at that frequency2004\nHowever the risk of hearing loss is not related to specific sound frequency, but rather to sound pressure (loudness) as it's stated in the article which you linked:\n\nExposure to loud noise. Loud noises, such as those from heavy equipment, chain saws and firearms, are common sources of noise-related hearing loss. Portable music devices, such as MP3 players or iPods, also can cause noise-related hearing loss if played loudly for long periods. Tinnitus caused by short-term exposure, such as attending a loud concert, usually goes away; long-term exposure to loud sound can cause permanent damage.\n\nTinnitus is one of the most important symptoms that can signal the onset of acoustic trauma.\nThose exposed to over 85 decibels of sound continually are at a higher risk for acoustic trauma. In other words, the ear can be exposed to short periods in excess of 120dB without permanent harm (having discomfort and possibly pain), however long term exposure to sound levels over 80dB can cause permanent hearing lossOSHA.\nAccording to Occupational Safety & Health Administration: Regulations (Standards - 29 CFR), these noise levels are permissible noise exposures:\n______________________________________________________________\n                            |\n  Duration per day, hours   | Sound level dBA slow response\n____________________________|_________________________________\n                            |\n8...........................|                    90\n6...........................|                    92\n4...........................|                    95\n3...........................|                    97\n2...........................|                   100\n1 1/2 ......................|                   102\n1...........................|                   105\n1/2 ........................|                   110\n1/4  or less................|                   115\n____________________________|________________________________\n\n\nWhen the daily noise exposure is composed of two or more periods of noise exposure of different levels, their combined effect should be considered, rather than the individual effect of\n  each.\nExposure to impulsive or impact noise should not exceed 140 dB peak sound pressure level.\n\nRead more:\n\nTinnitus and NIHL at Wikipedia\n\nSee also: When does the use of headphones become harmful?\n", "nutrition - Does the Jewish law forbidding the mixing of milk and meat have health benefits?": "\nScientific research has been conducted on the absorption of nutrients provided by both food groups when combined. From a nutritional point of view, the absorption of both calcium and iron could have the former prevent the absorption of the latter. \n\nIn single-meal human absorption studies, both haem- and non-haem-Fe absorption was inhibited by Ca supplements and by dairy products, the effect depending on the simultaneous presence of Ca and Fe in the lumen of the upper small intestine and also occurring when Ca and Fe were given in the fasting state. The quantitative effect, although dose dependent, was modified by the form in which Ca was administered and by other dietary constituents (such as phosphate, phytate and ascorbic acid) known to affect Fe bioavailability.\n\nand\n\nThe results of most multiple-meal human studies suggest that Ca supplementation will have only a small effect on Fe absorption unless habitual Ca consumption is very low. Outcome analyses showed that Ca supplements had no effect on Fe status in infants fed Fe-fortified formula, lactating women, adolescent girls and adult men and women. However it should be noted that the subjects studied had adequate intakes of bioavailable Fe and, except in one study, had relatively high habitual Ca intakes.\n\nSee: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19087437\n", "Does hot water kill germs better than cold water?": "\nSurprisingly, no. Hot water does kill bacteria, but what's comfortable for your hands is also pretty comfortable for bacteria. Most pathogens start to die off around 60\u00b0C to 70\u00b0C (140\u00b0F to 158\u00b0F)1, but water from the \"hot\" tap in a sink is typically below that (40\u00b0 to 55\u00b0C or 104\u00b0 to 131\u00b0F)2. In order to kill bacteria, the water would have to be way too hot for you to tolerate.\nAccording to National Geographic, in Washing Hands in Hot Water Wastes Energy:\n\nCarrico said that after a review of the scientific literature, her team found \"no evidence that using hot water that a person could stand would have any benefit in killing bacteria.\" Even water as cold as 40\u00b0F (4.4\u00b0C) appeared to reduce bacteria as well as hotter water, if hands were scrubbed, rinsed, and dried properly.\n\nThis agrees with the World Health Organization's conclusion3:\n\nWater temperature -\n  Apart from the issue of skin tolerance and level of comfort,\n  water temperature does not appear to be a critical factor for\n  microbial removal from hands being washed. In contrast, in a\n  study comparing water temperatures of 4 \u00b0C, 20 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C,\n  warmer temperatures have been shown to be very significantly\n  associated with skin irritation. The use of very hot water for\n  handwashing should therefore be avoided as it increases the\n  likelihood of skin damage.\n\nThere are a number of studies that have looked into water temperature and handwashing and concluded that there is little to no added benefit to washing with hotter water, for example:\n\nWater temperature as a factor in handwashing efficacy..

Based on the currently available scientific literature, it does not recommend using hotter water, as it does not seem to have an effect.\nIn short, scrubbing and using soap are far more effective for hand-washing than using hot water is.\n", "smoking - Oxygen saturation value of smokers": "\nThe OP observes:\n\nWhen I was a smoker, my own SpO2 was usually 100%.\n\nAlthough long-term smoking often does lead to changes in the lungs that cause hypoxemia (low peripheral O2 Saturation, a.k.a. SpO2), these effects are not immediate. In fact, in the short term, SpO2 may even be spuriously high, consistent with your observation. We should distinguish between the factors that drive changes in O2 saturation in long-term when compared to short-term smoking.*\nShort term\nAnother answer discussed the increased carbon monoxide (CO) levels in smokers, which is an immediate effect of the inhaled cigarette smoke that is dose-dependent (i.e. heavy smokers will inhale more CO than light smokers). \nA pulse oximeter measures the percentage of circulating hemoglobin to which oxygen is bound. By standard pulse oximetry, carboxy-hemoglobin is indistinguishable from oxyhemoglobin. Also, carbon monoxide causes a left-shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. This means the hemoglobin is holding onto the oxygen more tightly, resulting in a higher saturation of hemoglobin. It is for both of these reasons that students are often taught about the \u201ccherry red\u201d appearance of skin and mucous membranes in carbon monoxide poisoning.** In contrast to hypoxemia (low SpO2) when mucous membranes tend to turn blue due to low oxygen saturation, the hemoglobin saturation in carbon monoxide poisoning will be seen (both by our eyes and by pulse oximetry) as high. Pulse oximetry may be spuriously high in smokers due to the presence of carboxyhemoglobin. \nIn most young, healthy people, oxygen saturation is 98-100% anyway, so this difference is usually negligible. However, the point remains that the OP\u2019s observation is fully consistent with the effects of short-term smoking.\nLong-term\nLong-term smokers frequently do have low oxygen saturation despite the spurious elevation due to carbon monoxide. A full explanation of the mechanism would require a textbook of respiratory physiology. The basic idea is that the toxins in cigarette smoke lead to inflammation and remodeling in the lung that cause both obstructive pulmonary disease and decreased alveolar diffusing capacity. \nIt has been shown that early inflammatory changes are present even in young smokers with normal pulmonary function tests. These microscopic changes in the lung do not cause measurable changes in oxygen saturation or pulmonary function tests. However, evidence like this should reinforce to the OP (and any other former smokers around) how absolutely fabulous it is that you quit smoking.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n*The exact time period (more precisely, number of pack-years) after which the long-term effects begin to dominate the acute effects has substantial inter-individual variability.\n\n\n**This is rarely seen in real life, and it would only be present in those with higher doses of CO than that incurred from normal cigarette smoking. The theoretical point remains.\n\n", "virus - Is HIV the cause of AIDS?": "\nTo turn this question on its head, I'd like to propose a different question that the AIDS deniers haven't answered.\nIf HIV were not the cause of AIDS, why would anti-retroviral therapy be so successful in preventing the disease? Each of the meds in the cocktails that stave off AIDS limit the ability of the virus - the HIV virus - to reproduce.\nIt can be argued that AZT is effective against more viruses than HIV alone. Reverse Transcriptase (necessary for viral replication) is an enzyme necessary to the replication of many viruses. However, the AIDS denialists claim:\n\n...because the drugs are anti-viral and anti-bacterial in nature, they give a false impression of being effective for treating HIV infection. What appears a miraculous recovery in many patients is, in fact, the drugs\u2019 effects upon the opportunistic infectious agents the person may harbor at the time, other than HIV. (from your source)\n\nAZT is not an antibactial. Antibiotics (as well as things not to be taken internally, e.g. bleach) are antibacterials. Antibiotics treat Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii) and other microbial infections; they are useless against the common cold and other viruses. \nPneumocystis first came to attention as a cause of interstitial pneumonia in severely malnourished and premature infants during World War II in Central and Eastern Europe. Today, it is more common in immunosuppressed patients: \n\nClinically significant Pneumocystis pneumonia is virtually never observed in immunocompetent adults. Indeed, documentation of Pneumocystis jirovecii\n  in a patient without known underlying disease should prompt a careful search for occult immune suppression... trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole [the antibiotic Bactrim] remains  the  most  effective regimen for treating severe Pneumocystis pneumonia... Patients with previous Pneumocystis pneumonia should receive lifelong secondary prophylaxis, unless reconstitution of the immune system occurs. ...Ledergerber and colleagues analyzed episodes of recurrent Pneumocystis pneumonia in 325 HIV-infected patients after they had peripheral blood CD4 cell count greater than 200 cells/ml and found no cases of recurrent Pneumocystis during a follow-up period totaling 374 person-years. Prophylaxis should be reintroduced if the CD4+ count falls below 200 cells/ml.\n\nAn antibiotic can treat P. pneumonia in HIV-infected patients, but cannot restore immunocompetency; only anti-retrovirals can.\n\nThe standard treatment [of HIV] consists of a combination of at least three drugs (often called \u201chighly active antiretroviral therapy\u201d or HAART) that suppress HIV replication. Three drugs are used in order to reduce the likelihood of the virus developing resistance. \n\nOn the near-miraculous effect of combined antiretroviral in the treatment of HIV, your paper observes:\n\nBecause these drugs also attack non-infected cells, they can destroy the immune systems\u2019 healthy T-cells, and even cause a collapse identical to AIDS. \n\nBut they offer no evidence of such a claim. No drug is without potential side effects. Some antibiotics can cause aplastic anemia, a condition certain to result in an immunocompromised status. However combined antiretrovirals save lives, they do not cause AIDS.\nThe paper is full of similar holes.\nDeniers gain footholds by building straw men and knocking them down, not by advancing credible science.\nUntreated, HIV causes AIDS.

It also comes into play during the spring time change for those who live where DST is observed as well as in the shift from weekend/holiday to weekday sleep patterns for many.\nBegin by thinking of your body\u2019s circadian pattern on an X,Y graph1 where:\nx= time\ny= activity\n\nYour goal (\u201cphase advance\u201d) is to shift this curve leftward by three hours along the x axis. \nWhen attempting to manipulate circadian phase, the key is to understand your body\u2019s Zeitgebers.Your body intrinsically has circadian oscillators that confer the cycle and determine the period; Zeitgebers are external agents that entrain this oscillation by maintaining or shifting it along the x axis. The most powerful Zeitgeber, hands down, is light.\nNow the question is: what is the relationship between light and this curve? That turns out to be slightly complex in that the answer depends on the time in the circadian cycle during which the stimulus is applied. The relationship has been very well worked out in some very cool experimental protocols. Here it is:2\n\nYour goal is to achieve y= +3 (which corresponds to \u0394= -3 along the x axis on the first graph). You can see here that an optimal light stimulus perfectly timed is able to achieve almost a 3-hour shift in a single cycle. The optimal stimulus is going to be bright light in the blue frequency range, and the optimal timing is going to be about 2 hours before your habitual wake time. (About 45 min duration is probably just as good as a longer duration.) \nPractically, a good tip is: for two days prior to leaving, set your alarm an hour early and expose yourself to bright light (either broad-spectrum sunlight or blue light from a lightbox) for 30-45 min immediately upon waking. Each day\u2019s exposure can be expected to achieve a 1-1.5 hour phase advance, and this protocol can be remarkably effective for mitigating the jet lag on the following day when you need to get up 3 hours prior to your habitual wake time.\nThe other answer mentioned melatonin. Administered exogenously, this is indeed another Zeitgeber, although much less powerful than light. Melatonin also has a phase response curve that turns out to be basically 180\u00ba shifted relative to the light PRC. That is, if the optimal timing for light to phase advance is around 2 hours prior to the habitual wake time, the optimal timing for melatonin administration will be 12 hours prior to that. For most people that corresponds to  4-6 hours prior to their habitual bedtime.\nEating and exercise are both fairly weak Zeitgebers, and I wouldn\u2019t worry about them too much. As usual in circadian biology, it\u2019s all about light!3 \n\n\n1. Image from: http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/PracticeReviews/cpr_Actigraphy.pdf\nAncoli-Israel et al.

Although a three-hour phase shift is fairly easy to manage by predicting the phase of the PRC based on prior sleep habits, this starts to become more complicated in larger shifts. This is especially problematic in the case of Eastward travel >5h, when morning light at the destination ends up falling within the negative phase of the PRC and therefore delays the circadian curve. This is the wrong thing in this setting and is a common reason for protracted jet lag. Here, it is actually avoidance of morning light that is desired. This is complicated!\n\n", "eye - Can wearing eyeglasses cause your eyesight to degrade further?": "\nAccording to the Mayo Clininc, no.

True cinnamon (derived from the plant Cinnamomum verum), also called Ceylon cinnamon and cassia cinnamon (derived from the plant Cinnamomum cassia). Although they are closely related they are different species and the distinction between the two was made early on since they are not only regionally separated but also tasting slightly different. And since your tongue might already tell you that: meaning their chemical composition is different. Concerning the quality of taste: true cinnamon is commonly described as milder, weaker, more elegant. Cassia on the other hand is cheaper per volume and more efficient to achieve a certain level of cinnamon taste.\nI'll focus on cassia cinnamon rather than Ceylon (\"natural cinnamon\") because the levels of coumarin are higher and it's better to be safe than sorry.\nDoing the math, take your weight (in lbs.) and multiply by .221 to get the daily recommended limit in milligrams (in Germany).\n\nCeylon Cinnamon has less than 0.04% Coumarin while Cassia Cinnamon has\n  in the region of 4%. {1}\n\nLet's say you're petite or a developing child (80 lbs.) and can't handle as much coumarin. 80 * .221 = 17.68 milligrams of coumarin.\nIf we imagine 17.68 as 4% of some daily intake of cinnamon, that would be 442 milligrams or .442 grams of cinnamon daily.\nOf course, if you happened to weigh twice as much, your intake would be twice that, and so on.\nAlso, if you want to take 6 grams of cinnamon per day, it seems that Ceylon is the better choice to prevent overexposure to coumarin, since you can take close to a hundred times more.\nDisclaimers:\n\nLevels of coumarin in cassia cinnamon vary greatly even in bark from\nthe same tree. {4}\nThe recommended daily intake exists in Europe, not US.\nLevels of coumarin from cassia are already too high from a health standpoint if eaten as a spice in comparatively low amounts, intake levels needed for a \"natural supplement\" of unproven benefit will quickly exceed that range\n\nSources:\nhttp://www.bfr.bund.de/en/faq_on_coumarin_in_cinnamon_and_other_foods-8487.html\nhttps://www.osha.gov/dts/chemicalsampling/data/CH_229620.html\nhttp://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101103135352.htm\n", "vaccination - Can getting the flu shot make you sicker next year?": "\nI've worked on influenza in the past, and I've never heard that particular justification for missing a flu vaccine before.

However, the only common one I know of is Dengue fever, where exposure to one strain makes infections from other strains much more severe.\nWere your friend's belief be true, all vaccines that miss a strain (which are functionally similar to not being vaccinated) would be serious problems for the next year, because everyone would be in the position you're describing - immunologically having missed a vaccine - and there's no evidence I can find of that, and absolutely no mention of it in most influenza vaccination guidelines.\n", "donor - Time intervals between blood donations": "\nThe only known significant long-term risk of blood donation is iron deficiency. Immunity (which you asked about) is primarily mediated by white blood cells, which can be easily deployed from the lymphatic system and bone marrow to replace those lost in donation. Red blood cells, on other hand, are not stored as mature cells in large numbers outside of the bloodstream. They also contain hemoglobin, which requires iron for its production. The body has a limited supply of iron, and when red blood cells are removed via blood donation, this can be depleted. Approximately 200 - 230 mg of iron is lost during a standard blood donation (~450 mL whole blood). It has been shown that short-term iron supplementation is effective in replacing iron loss.1\nThe American Red Cross recommends donors wait 8 weeks between transfusions. The NHS guideline is more conservative, recommending 12 weeks for men and 16 weeks for women. The difference between the sexes in that recommendation is because women lose blood regularly through menstruation and thus tend to have lower stores of iron and can easily become anemic. The threshold hemoglobin level required for donation is also different between the US and Europe: 12.5 g/dL for both sexes in the US; 12.5 g/dL for women but 13.5 g/dL for men in the Europe.* \nThe optimal interval for blood donation remains a bit of an open question. (Note that for women, the NHS recommendation is twice as long as the Red Cross\u2019s recommendation!) To investigate that, there was recently a large trial conducted within NHS centers that randomized men to 12-week, 10-week, or 8-week intervals between donation while women were randomized to 16-week versus 14-week versus 12-week intervals.2 They will report hemoglobin levels in donors, including the number of donations that have to be deferred due to hemoglobin levels below the recommended levels (NHS guidelines above). The full methodology is available online, but to my knowledge the results have not yet been published.   \n\n\nReferences\n \n\n1. Radtke H, Mayer B, R\u00f6cker L, Salama A, Kiesewetter H.

I have no idea what the acceptable level of failure is for contact manufacturers though. \nLet's assume that you abide by all the usage instructions; that is, if they are monthly, weekly, or daily, you change them at that correct interval. Also, note that some contact lenses will have a longer life span with certain contact lens solutions. Off the top of my head, Air Optix is one of these brands. With this brand, you should be using Pure Moist I believe. Just following the boxes cleaning regiment will not suffice if you are using the wrong solution with the lenses. \nNow, let's suppose you are doing everything correctly. Unfortunately, some lenses will not be up to par (such is engineering and in life not everything is perfect). Therefore, this set of lenses will become less breathable in a shorter amount of time. If you are the unlucky soul who perpetually gets the dud box, there can be negative side effects. One side effect is from ischemia which was mentioned in the comments. When the eye is starved of oxygen, blood vessels will begin to grow on the eye in order to get oxygen rich blood to the tissue and over time will cause Corneal Neovascularization.\nThe scenario I described is a long shot but it cold theoretically happen although it is very unlikely.\nOther side effects could be that you get some kind of dirt or grim in your eye that gets under the contact lenses. This foreign body could end up scratching the cornea.\nHowever, if you are diligent in following your eye care instructions, use the correct contact lenses solutions, and use common sense, more than likely, you will not have any problems from wearing contact lenses.\n\nContact Lenses cause Corneal Neovascularization\nCorneal Abrasion\n\n", "Does blood donation reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?": "\nIn premenopausal women, the risk of developing atherosclerosis is half that of men.  In 1991, Sullivan proposed the iron hypothesis which attributed this decreased risk to  premenopausal women's lower blood iron levels, and suggested that blood donation may reduce the risk of developing atherosclerosis.\nThe validity of the hypothesis is still an open question and presenting an analysis of current evidence would be long and inappropriate.  \nHowever honing in on the question of randomized clinical trials on the effects of blood donation, a first randomized clinical trial (FeAST) was conducted by Dr. Zacharski et al. in 2007, examining the effects of phlebotomy on the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  The study found that a reduction in body iron stores did not significantly decrease all-cause mortality or death plus nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke.\nThis FeAST trial has several limitations one primarily being that the trial focused on secondary prevention in patients who had existing PAD, rather than focusing on primary prevention as postulated by the iron hypothesis.  \nTherefore further research is still required before a conclusion can be reached on the validity of the iron hypothesis.\n", "first aid - Pulmonary diseases and oxygen therapy": "\nThe basic idea is that people with pulmonary diseases that involve chronic hypoventilation rely on mild hypoxia to stimulate respiration.\nTo understand this, consider a basic homeostatic feedback loop that controls respiratory drive. During a breath hold, carbon dioxide levels rise and oxygen levels fall. Carbon dioxide diffuses across the blood-brain barrier and causes a decrease in CSF pH sensed at central chemoreceptors in the brainstem. The peripheral serum pH may also be depressed, stimulating peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies. In normally ventilating people, these \"hypercarbic indicators\" are the primary mediators of the drive to breath.\nIn patients with chronic hypoventilation, PaCO2 is chronically elevated. Common hypo-ventilatory diseases include:\n\nCOPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)\nobesity-hypoventilation syndrome\nneuro-muscular weakness syndromes (generally only in later phases when the diaphragm is affected: Becker/Duchenne muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc.)\n\nThe old theory goes that because these folks have chronically elevated PaCO2*, the hypercarbic respiratory feedback loop described above \u201cacclimates\u201d and is no longer the primary driver of breathing. Instead, they rely on the hypoxic respiratory drive, which is secondary in normal people. These individuals may have a usual SpO2 ~88-90%. When a non-rebreather mask is applied and suddenly drives their SpO2 up to 100%, their respiratory drive decreases because their blunted hypercarbic response mechanisms do not respond normally to the progressive rise in PaCO2. \nThere are data in support of this theory. One study in COPD patients administered 100% oxygen to patients with COPD and observed a 18% decrease in ventilation after 15 minutes that returned to baseline when oxygen was removed (Aubier). However, these authors also showed that two other factors were at play explaining the observed rise in PaCO2:\n\nAbout 30% of the  increase in PaCO2 associated with high-flow oxygen administration was attributable to the Haldane effect, which is basically an offloading of CO2 by hemoglobin (due to a rightward shift of the carboxyhemoglobin dissociation curve), increasing the CO2 dissolved in blood but not reflecting a true change in ventilation. \nAn additional 48% of the increase in hypercapnia was due to dead space ventilation. The simplified idea is that the vessels in the lung compensate for hypoxia by vaso-constricting areas with low oxygen tension, so-called ventilation-perfusing matching. When high-flow oxygen is administered, the vaso-constriction is released so perfusion of poorly ventilated areas increases. Now a higher percentage of the blood is not being cleared of CO2. This is called ventilation-perfusion  \u200bmis\u200bmatching. \n\nSomething similar has been demonstrated in patients with obesity-hypoventilation (Wijesinghe). In light of this, a recent study investigated the best strategy for oxygen administration in patients with chronic hypoventilation (Kim). They found that a strategy titrating oxygen administration to achieve SpO2 88% to 92% minimized the risk of worsening hypoventilation while achieving adequate relief of shortness of breath and adequate oxygenation.\nA helpful review of these topics provides a bit more detail for those interested (Abdo).\n\n\nAbdo WF and Heunks LM.

Having old records around to compare results to  might be beneficial. \nIn many countries, medical professionals or labs might be required by law to keep your records around and hand those results over to you or any doctor you authorize for a number of years. For example, here in Germany, they need to keep normal laboratory results for ten years, for some other items this can be up to 30 years. Similar laws exist in the UK and the US (where the exact legislation is state-specific, as far as I can tell). Since it can be a hassle getting them when you, for example, move, I'd also keep copies myself, though. \nThe point of keeping old non-significant test results around can be:\n\nto see that a significant result later is a new addition. As such, if a later test shows elevated blood sugar / hemoglobin, a doctor at least has an estimate of when this problem started. \nto reveal a trend, for example decreasing Vitamin D levels making supplementation desirable, or slowly increasing TSH levels pointing to a beginning hypothyroidism. More tests can then be ordered if necessary. \nsince \"normal ranges\" are just normal for a population, and not necessarily for you (see How reference ranges are established), even a value that is marked as non-significant might not actually be normal for you. Having many values from the past can show an outlier that would be within the reference range, but is a significant result for you. \n\nOne example where a trend within \"normal\" levels could be of diagnostic value is hemoglobin:\n\nPaying close attention to routine blood test results can be an effective screening system for colon cancer which, when diagnosed early enough, can be treated effectively. A new study shows that most patients with colon cancer have a history of consistently declining hemoglobin levels up to four years before being diagnosed with the disease\n\nIs your hemoglobin 'trending'? Routine blood tests may provide early warning for colorectal cancer\nSince for most people this would just amount to asking for a copy at a doctor's visit and then putting it in a folder when coming home, keeping the records doesn't appear too difficult to not do it. \n", "caffeine - Can caffeinated shampoo have a noticeable effect?": "\nThere is a study described at nih.gov about the rate of absorption of caffeine through the skin and how hair follicles contribute to it (\"significantly\", is apparently the answer to that).  Another study compared how three different substances, including caffeine traveled through different thicknesses of skin in humans and animals \nThe first-referenced article above has this summary about what was known at the beginning of the study:\n\nRecently, it has been shown that the hair follicles are responsible\n  for a fast delivery of topically applied substances. After topical\n  application, caffeine was already detected in the blood of the\n  volunteers after 5 min, whereas, when the hair follicles were\n  selectively blocked utilizing the newly developed Follicular Closing\n  Technique (FCT), caffeine was detectable only after 20 min\n\nFaith Williams, a researcher who studies skin's permeability to chemicals, had this to say about caffeinated soap in a 2003 article for the Guardian:\n\nCaffeine does go through the skin if you apply it to the surface in\n  solution But I would have\n  thought that not much would go through [from soap] because I don't\n  think it would stay in contact for very long.\n\nGiven that statement, you might experiment on yourself (after getting all the requisite sign-offs that you're complying with human subject research ethics of course) by leaving the shampoo on your scalp for a longer time before rinsing.\n", "nutrition - How many eggs can one eat per day?": "\nMetabolic rate, individual genetics, cholesterol-absorption controversies, nutrients of the egg, size of the egg, and definition of \"maximum\" all contribute to ambiguity.\nThis list of egg sizes and corresponding nutrition panels with daily recommended values is a good starting place, but I will also address this in a general context of what experts recommend and nutrient content.\nCholesterol\nWhen people talk about eggs, they usually want to talk about cholesterol.\nThe problem is that the body doesn't fully absorb all of the cholesterol, so there's no hard rule. What we do know is:\n\nA large egg contains about 185 mg of cholesterol. {2}\nAlthough there is no precise basis for selecting a target level for\ndietary cholesterol intake for all individuals, the AHA recommends\n<300 mg/d on average. {3}\nYour body doesn't absorb everything you eat. (That's part of why we go to the bathroom.)\n\nRegistered dietitian Leslie Beck recommends:\n\nPeople at high risk for cardiovascular disease \u2013 e.g. people with diabetes, high cholesterol, and/or hypertension and smokers \u2013 should definitely limit their intake of egg yolks... some experts advise avoidance.\n\nHowever, for healthy people with no medical condition, regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight are better strategies to guard against heart disease and stroke, not cutting down on eggs (for 70 - 75% of the population). The two studies cited indicate that consumption of eggs does not raise cholesterol levels significantly for about 3/4ths of the population.\nFat and Calories\nEach egg yolk contains 6 g of fat and 54 kcal. Even though they're full of nutrients, they still do contain calories, so factor that into your daily intake. Someone who does an average amount of physical activity would probably require an average amount of eggs. Definitely not something on the level of dozens, but even so, giving any numbers would be hard since there are so many factors in play.\nVitamins and Minerals\nEggs are naturally rich in vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B12, vitamin D, selenium and iodine. They also contain vitamin A and a number of other B vitamins including folate, biotin, pantothenic acid and choline, and essential minerals and trace elements, including phosphorus. {6}\nBefore reaching a daily recommended value of any of these nutrients though, you would probably far exceed the daily recommended values for fat and calories first, but it's possible to overdose on anything, so be sure to keep track of how much of these nutrients are in each egg that you consume in the event that you're burning off all the fat and calories.\nSummary\nTo know your \"maximum\" number of eggs, you should probably talk to a dietitian.\nSources\n\nhttp://www.eggnutritioncenter.org/egg-facts/nutrition-facts-panels/\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/expert-answers/cholesterol/FAQ-20058468\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/content/102/18/2284.full\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16340654/\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21776466\nhttp://www.egginfo.co.uk/egg-nutrition#sthash.ueExphBh.dpuf\n\n", "radiology - Effects of X-rays on the human body": "\nA person should undergo Xrays as often an they are necessary, because the risk-to-benefit ratio is usually very far in favor of the benefit.\nAs an example of this idea of risk-to-benefit ratio, lets take getting into a car.\nThere is always a risk to getting into a car. After all, they move quickly, slide on slippery roads, and hurl towards (and potentially at) each other at a frightening rate of speed. You probably know someone who died in a car accident. Yet, probably without giving it a single thought - except when you're buckling your seat belt - you get into a car several times per day/week. Because the benefit (distance transportation, convenience) is higher than the risk of injury in a motor vehicle accident (this example is actually flawed, but we'll ignore that for the moment.)\nSimilarly, there is always a risk to getting an xray, but sometimes you just have to get them. The risk is low compared to the benefit. You wouldn't want anyone putting you in a cast without knowing what kind of bone fracture you had, because some kinds need to be casted differently, some need to be casted longer, some need operative repair, and some only need a splint. The benefit outweighs the risk.\nThere is no completely safe lower limit of radiation. Radiation (especially in fetuses and children) increases the likelihood of cancer. Our information comes mostly from atomic bomb survivors, people exposed at Chernobyl (nuclear reactor accidents), people treated with high doses of radiation for cancer and other conditions, and people exposed to high levels of background radiation, e.g. uranium miners.\nRadiation doses are measured in millisieverts (mSv). For comparison's sake, you should know that, depending on where you live, \n\nnatural background radiation exposure accounts for an average of 3.1 mSv/yr\nA seven hour airplane trip exposes you to 0.02 mSv of radiation per trip\nBackscatter Wave Scanners in airports exposure is just less than 0.0001 mSv per scan (so one average year exposes you to 31,000 times as much radiation as an airport scanner.)\na four bite-wing dental series is about 0.005 mSv\na two view Chest X Ray doses you 0.1 mSv\nyour average CT scan is going to give you 7 mSv of exposure \n\nIs that safe? What is your chance of getting a lethal cancer from that? The answer is: no one knows. It depends on a lot of unmeasurable things: genetics, your age, your ability to repair the damage, which area of the body is being dosed, whether there are other carcinogens at work (e.g. viruses or co-carcinogens), etc.\nThe following all give you a (estimated) 1 in a million chance of dying from that event:\n\n\nSmoking 1.4 cigarettes (lung cancer)\nEating 40 tablespoons of peanut butter\nSpending 2 days in New York City (air pollution)\nDriving 40 miles in a car (accident)\nFlying 2500 miles in a jet (accident)\nCanoeing for 6 minutes\nReceiving 10 mrem (.1 mSv) of radiation (cancer)\n\n\nSo, you can estimate that (maybe) the risk of dying from a 7 mSv CT scan is about equivalent to driving 2800 miles.\nTaken individually: \n\nWhat is the maximum number of times a person can undergo x-ray scanning? \n\nAs often as necessary. As long as the benefit outweighs the risk.\n\nIs their a maximum limit? If so, what are the side effects that the person will be subjected to if he undergoes x-ray scanning more number of times?\n\nNo, there's no maximum limit. The risk is cancer. The risk is low, but not negligible. It doesn't go up linearly with every Xray study you have.\n\nAre they life threatening and do they have long term effects on the body of the person?\n\nYes; cancers are often life threatening.\nWhat can you do about it?\n\nDon't ask your doctor for an unnecessary Xray.\nAsk your doctor if an Xray they ordered is necessary (sometimes they are ordered to reassure the patient - or their parents, in the case of head injury - that nothing is wrong.) A doctor worth their salt will respect you for asking. Sometimes it's ok to take a \"wait-and-see\" approach. Sprained ankles meeting certain criteria never need an Xray.

The stomach doesn't act as a beaker; it has input and shakes things up.\nThe chyme is passed into the duodenum, where digestion takes place, and continues through the small intestines. Once the food reaches the large intestion, it is pretty much digested, and water reabsorption takes place.\nSurprising Facts About Your Stomach\n", "Does bed type have an effect on sleep quality?": "\nThis seems like a common sense type of question (why don't you sleep on the floor when there's a sofa available, and why don't you sleep on a sofa when there's a comfortable bed available?), and it turns out it is.\nAccording to a small study done recently in a sleep laboratory,\n\nInformation concerning the stages of sleep is one of the most important clues for determining the quality of a particular mattress. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of mattress type on sleep quality by measuring skin temperature, by using a subjective mattress rating system, and through the use of Polysomnogram (the recording of brain waves through electroencephalography, the generation of a video graphic record of eye movement, chin movements, and heart rhythm.) ...The percentages of wake after sleep onset and stage 1 sleep were lower when subjects slept on \u201ccomfortable\u201d mattresses. Subjective ratings of sleep quality paralleled recorded sleep data.\n\n\"Comfortable\" is the key word here. How comfortable a mattress is depends on personal preferences, position of sleep (side sleepers vs back/stomach), presence/absence of low back pain, heat retention properties of mattress/bedding, etc.\nWhile this would seem like an important area to study, there has been very little in the way of well-developed recent studies.  \nMost of the recent studies on mattress types are concerned with the prevention of SIDS.\nQuantitative effects of mattress types (comfortable vs. uncomfortable) on sleep quality through polysomnography and skin temperature \n", "venom - First aid measures for a snake bite": "\nThese are the steps that you want to take:\n\nIf you can see the snake, be prepared to describe it. DO NOT attempt to catch it. If you can get a quick picture with a camera/cell phone, do so.\nGet the person out of biting distance of the snake. (Avoid getting bitten yourself)\nKeep the person calm, with the wound below the level of the heart, preferably lying down.\nCover the wound with a loose sterile bandage.\nCall Emergency Medical or take the victim to an ER. Even if the person appears healthy, toxin effects can take several hours to appear, and early intervention is always better.\nIf there is inflammation or swelling, trace around it with a pen. This can give an indication of reaction progression.\nRemoved jewelry/rings/watches as swelling can prevent removal later. (Thanks to Shublu, I had forgotten this one).\n\nIf you are not near a civilized area (Such as hiking, backpacking, camping), several \"tried and true\" methods are not actually effective:\nDO NOT\n\nCut and suck: You can introduce venom into yourself, the cutting can spread the venom further, and you risk damaging underlying muscle/organs.\nUse ice: It doesn't prevent the spread of venom, and can cause frostbite if applied for too long\nElectrical shocks - Ineffective and can cause burns and/or stop the heart.\nUse alcohol - It may deaden pain, but will cause blood vessels to expand, increasing the spread of venom.\nUse a tourniquet/constriction band - Have not proven effective, and can cause more tissue damage and possibly cause limb loss if left on too long.\nGive aspirin - Aspirin is a blood thinner and can cause increase bleeding/spread.\n\nAgain, that is a list of ^^^WHAT NOT TO DO^^^.\nThe good thing about snake bites is that many bites do not actually envenom the victim, and of those that do, it may not be a full dose. Keeping calm and keeping the bite victim calm are going to be the best things you can do, as panic can cause other symptoms that may be mistakenly attributed to the snakebite.\nRemember that children and small people are at a higher risk because of body size, as are people that are already compromised in some way health wise. Keep calm, make the victim comfortable and contact EMS or get to an ER.\nHere is a fairly comprehensive review as published by the NIH (National Institute of Health, US-based entity) of the steps to take, as well as the listing of common venomous creatures encountered. My only contention is that if a person is exhibiting shock signs it recommends elevating the legs, but very often the leg is where the bite is. I would (personally, anyway) maintain a lying, neutral position in those cases.\nHowever, while it recommends the use of a venom kit (Sawyer makes a very popular model) it has been shown in a study that such kits failed to remove any \"venom\" from the test site. (Further discussion at the Wall Street Journal).\n", "sleep - Is there a link between bed firmness and spine deformations?": "\nWe should clarify some terms here. Scoliosis is a deformation, but Lordosis and kyphosis are not. The latter two are normal structural parts of human spine. \nBack to your question, we don\u00b4t know.\nAltogether the pathogenesis of scoliosis is poorly established and mostly unknown. \nIn adolescent scoliosis, it seems that presence of scoliosis is mostly associated to genetic factors (Burwell et al.). 97% of patients presenting with adolescent scoliosis have a positive familial history (Dayer et al.).\nA recent review article sums the current knowledge of the pathogenesis of scoliosis (Dayer et al.). The interactions in molecular level, brain, vestibular system and in structural biomechanics are extremely complex and authors conclude quite fairly: \"Many factors are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of adolescent scoliosis, leading some authors to formulate a complex collective model from these different concepts.\"\nAs so there is not currently any explicit evidence which would state the harms of any static risk factors (sleeping) affecting to development of scoliosis. Partly due to this vagueness I think the debate regarding risk of scoliosis is prone to bias and emotional \"truths\" and wisdoms.\nIn a recent population level study, authors found that sleeping in hammock was inversely associated to scoliosis (Baroni et al.). Still, it's possible that this study failed to take into account the possibility that children with scoliosis might be less likely to sleep in a hammock because of possible back pain in the morning. Correlation (or inverse correlation) does not imply causation.\n", "home remedies - Does echinacea help prevent or treat a viral infection?": "\nSome species are used to treat and prevent common cold, flu, and other infections.\nOne study from 2002 didn't find any significant differences between the echinacea and placebo groups for any measured outcomes. Another study from 2003 confirmed that Echinacea purpurea was not effective in treating URI (upper respiratory tract infections) symptoms in children and its use was usually associated with an increased risk of rash. The more recent one from 2014 didn't provide enough benefits for treating colds by using Echinacea products, although there could be a weak benefit, but potential effects are of questionable clinical relevance.\nSo two NCCIH-funded studies didn't find any benefits from using it. Others found that it may be beneficial, so the results are mixed and it's not clear whether it can prevent or effectively treat URIs (such as common cold) and NCCIH is continuing to support the study of echinacea as well as potential effects on the immune systemNCCIH.\n", "brain - What are the consequences of chronic sleep deprivation for mental function?": "\nMost of the time it is critically important to realize that sleep deprivation is very often due to unrecognized sleep disorders. After a typical night's sleep, you may not feel restored and refreshed and be sleepy during the day, but be totally unaware that you are sleep-deprived or have a sleep disorder. You might tend to think, \"It's just the stress of work or the kids,\" or you might have \"always felt this way\" and had no idea that you should feel differently. This lack of awareness compounds the consequences, because so many people remain undiagnosed for years.  Now speaking about the disorders or consequences that the sleep deprivation can cause are. \n\nDecreased Performance and Alertness: Sleep deprivation induces significant reductions in performance and alertness. Reducing your nighttime sleep by as little as one and a half hours for just one night could result in a reduction of daytime alertness by as much as 32%.\n\nMemory and Cognitive Impairment: Decreased alertness and excessive daytime sleepiness impair your memory and your cognitive ability -- your ability to think and process information.\n\nAutomobile Injury: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates conservatively that each year drowsy driving is responsible for at least 100,000 automobile crashes, 71,000 injuries, and 1,550 fatalities.\nIncrease Stroke risk:Even without the typical risk factors, like being overweight or having a family history, short sleep can up your risk for stroke, according to 2012 research. Adults who regularly slept fewer than six hours a night had four times the risk of stroke symptoms,\n\nFuel Memory Loss:You probably know that on the days when you are most tired, you're forgetful and unfocused -- but sleep deprivation can lead to permanent cognitive issues. The less we sleep, the less we benefit from the memory-storing properties of sleep. But additionally, a lack of sleep can cause \"brain deterioration,\" according to a 2013 study, which may at least in part explain memory loss in seniors.\n\n\nsee also:\n\nImportant sleep habits:webMd.com\n8 Scary Side Effects Of Sleep Deprivation\nExtent and Health Consequences of Chronic Sleep Loss and Sleep\nDisorders\nSleep Deprivation: Wikipedia\n\n", "In what ways do studies indicate that smoking marijuana is detrimental to long-term health, if any?": "\nThis seems like a difficult question as there continues to be a large amount of conflicting reports about the extent of biological\n   consequences regarding cannabis usage.\nHowever,\n\nThere is general consensus that smoking cannabis causes irreversible cognitive impairment in    children and pre-pubescent\nadolescents. {6}\nMarijuana smoke has been listed on the California Proposition 65\nwarning list as a carcinogen since 2009. {7} One should note this is the smoke, not the plant.\nCannabis consumption in pregnancy is associated with restrictions in\ngrowth of the fetus, miscarriage, and cognitive deficits in\noffspring. {8}\nContrary to common belief, marijuana can be addictive. Research\nsuggests that about 1 in 11 users becomes addicted to marijuana\n(Anthony, 1994; Lopez-Quintero 2011).This number increases among\nthose who start as teens (to about 17 percent, or 1 in 6) and among\npeople who use marijuana daily (to 25-50 percent) (Hall, 2009a; Hall,\n2009b).{9}\n\nGiven the above references, there are some points that should be emphasized.\n\nMarijuana use is not associated with elevated cancer risk as shown\nin preclinical studies.{10}\n(Separate link to news article here.)\n[Marijuana does not cause long-term cognitive impairment in users who\nstart after 21 years old.{12}\nCompared to other substances, marijuana is not very addicting. It is\nestimated that 32% of tobacco users will become addicted, 23% of\nheroin users, 17% of cocaine users, and 15% of alcohol users. Cocaine\nand heroin are more physically harmful and nicotine is much more\naddictive. It is much harder to quit smoking cigarettes than it is to\nquit smoking pot.\n\nThere are some studies that indicate \"marijuana may increase cravings for other drugs\" and that \"THC exposure increases tobacco\u2019s addictive effects\", which is what leads to the Gateway Drug Theory. This is the theory that marijuana causes an individual to become addicted to other drugs more easily. Although not fully proven, these sources indicate some correlations when tested on mice, meaning people who use marijuana may be more likely to get addicted to cocaine, heroin, and other similar heavily addicting drugs. This sounds frightening except that the majority of people don't try those more dangerous drugs.\nBoiling it all down, these sources seem to suggest that marijuana is NOT a carcinogen if you don't smoke it, but does cause mental and physical detriments to anyone still growing. There's a small chance you could get addicted if you use it as a coping mechanism, but statistically speaking, there's a less than 10% chance of getting addicted. Additionally, if you decide to use marijuana, don't try other drugs that could be addictive.\n", "nutrition - How much pesticide remains on a harvested organic fruit?": "\nWashing and peeling conventional fruits and vegetables only helps to reduce the levels of pesticides that may be on the surface as reflected by USDA test data1999. As we know the pesticides needs to be toxic to kill pests, therefore potential long-term health effects of exposure to pesticides can include: cancer, neurotoxic effects and many morewiki.\nUnder the FQPA, EPA has the authority to ensure that all pesticides meet the safety standards. They estimates the exposure to a pesticide from different sources such as food, determine the health risks and set the limits of tolerance which is maximum amount of pesticides that is permitted in/on the food. This is systemically tested as part of the Carcinogenic Potency Project.\nThe recent meta-analysis of 343 studies from 2014 shown that organic food has 4 times less pesticide residues, toxic/heavy metals (e.g. Cd and Pb) and other chemicals than in conventional crops which can bioaccumulate in the body over time 2014.\nAccording to EWG, buying certain organic food can significantly lower residue exposurewiki, because organic crop production standards prohibit the use of synthetic chemical products and certain mineral fertilisers.\n\nHow much pesticide residue remains on organic food?\n\nThe toxicology of natural and synthetic chemicals is similar, so it's probable that almost every fruit and vegetable contains natural pesticides1992.\nOne scientific literature notes:\n\nWhat does not follow from this, however, is that chronic exposure to the trace amounts of pesticides found in food results in demonstrable toxicity. This possibility is practically impossible to study and quantifywiki.\n\nTherefore it's not possible to determine health benefits of eating organic food by measuring how much pesticides remain on food as it really depends on agronomic practices/protocols and soil pollution which can affect crop composition.\nTherefore eating organic fruits in general is safe and you shouldn't worry about pesticides too much.\nSee also: Are organic foods more healthy than conventional foods?\n", "toxicity - Why is it recommended to not expose plastic water bottles to sunlight?": "\nIf talking about the container itself and the chemicals it might leave on the product being consumed then these fears are mostly related to the fact that BPA  (bisphenol A) is present in poly-carbonate bottles and on the adverse effects this has on the brains and development on reproductive organs of mice.\nHowever, when compared and related to humans, the effects don't seem to be that devastating to human health, see: http://www.bisphenol-a.org/whatsNew/20080205.html\n", "sleep - Does sleeping position affect health?": "\nI am focusing on one important health issue with respect to sleep position. Obstructive sleep apnea or apnoea (OSA) is a common condition where person has excessive snoring and disturbed sleep at night. These persons may also have headaches in the morning, daytime sleepiness, chronic fatigue or exhaustion, impaired functioning and emotional disturbances. Many expensive therapies are available but adjusting sleep position is an inexpensive method that may help greatly. Sleeping on the side (and not on the back) is recommended for this. Sleeping on the back causes the tongue to fall back and obstruct the airway, producing snoring and other features of sleep apnea syndrome. Extra pillows, as a pillow between the knees, may be used to get comfortable in this position. \nReferences:\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6740055\nhttp://umm.edu/health/medical/reports/articles/obstructive-sleep-apnea\nhttp://www.britishsnoring.co.uk/why_do_i_snore/sleeping_position.php\nhttp://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/features/sleep-position-and-sleep-quality\nhttp://sleepapneadisorder.info/2011/08/18/the-best-sleeping-positions/\n", "infection - How effective was the 2014-2015 influenza vaccination?": "\nThere have been no additional reports in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which was where your original article points to regarding the efficacy of the flu vaccine.\nHowever, the most recent update on influenza activity within the United States, which was about a month later than your report, does not suggest there has been any mid-season change in the dominant circulating strains, so the early estimates are likely in the same area.\nThe one thing that may change this is that a larger number of last season cases of influenza are typically caused by influenza B viruses, as shown in this figure below:\n\nThe low effectiveness of the vaccine against the dominant circulating A strains does not necessarily imply a similarly low effectiveness against the later B strains, especially as B strains appear to be somewhat more stable.\n", "sugar - Does having too much sugary things cause headaches?": "\nOur body needs sugar (carbohydrates) where most of our energy comes from. When you eat sugar, it's converted into glucose and carried in the blood to different parts including brain.\nIf you eat too much sugar, it can cause \u2018reactive hypoglycaemia\u2019 when your sudden rise of blood-glucose can trigger an over-production of insulin which in turn makes the blood-glucose levels fall too low. As result of excessive insulin release your brain is not receiving enough glucose and the symptoms could include headache and migraine.\nSource: Migraine Fact Sheets at Migraine Trust\nTo prevent sugar/glucose crash from happening, you should limit your sugar intake (e.g. by eating smaller portions). Also exercising regularly increases sugar uptake which decrease excessive insulin release.\n", "cancer - Is moderate alcohol consumption beneficial for maximizing life expectancy?": "\nAnother answer did a great job laying out some of the difficulties plaguing research on this topic. Observational data in the area are (hopelessly?) confounded. I would like to point out two alternative lines of research that may leave the reader with some hope that we\u2019ll eventually have a good answer to this question.\n\nSurrogate markers: A major difficulty with research in this area is that it\u2019s not practical to randomize an adequate number of people to alcohol vs no alcohol1 for a long enough period of time to see statistically significant differences in outcomes like heart attacks, strokes, and death. However, in many areas \u2014 most prominently cardiovascular disease \u2014 researchers have used surrogate markers that tend to evolve more quickly and have been shown to correlate with the real endpoint that we are interested in. This approach allows us to:\n\nAcquire randomized data due to the shorter duration of study required, avoiding all of the mess of observational confounds or; \n(Less optimal but still something): use observational methods but analyze endpoints that are less likely to be confounded. \n\nI include two papers that review interventional data suggesting a benefit of alcohol on surrogate endpoints: \nEffect of alcohol consumption on biological markers associated with risk of coronary heart disease: systematic review and meta-analysis of interventional studies.2\nThe Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Insulin Sensitivity and Glycemic Status: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Intervention Studies.3 \nDespite the feasibility benefits of surrogate endpoints, these \u201cmarkers of malign\u201d carry certain caveats and can not be regarded as providing a definitive answer about whether alcohol should be recommended to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.\nRandomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials (with real endpoints) in the making: \nThis is what we want. There is an NIH U34 active for planning a multi-center long-term randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of alcohol on the development of chronic diseases. You may be wondering how you randomize and blind people to alcohol consumption. Although the methodology of that large trial is not yet published (to my knowledge), the Mukamal lab has a history of putting tasteless grain alcohol in Crystal Light (see also, WallStreet Journal blog piece). That feasibility study was completed; I look forward to updating this answer in a few years when the data from the large RCT are published.\n\n\n\n1. Note that although resveratrol, a component of red wine, has been publicized as the possibly beneficial agent (partly because it can be put in supplements and sold...), many researchers in the field consider ethanol itself to be of more interest. The data in this answer all investigate ethanol rather than other components of wine or beer, several of which may carry additional benefits.\n \n\n2. Brien, SE et al. BMJ.2011;342:d636\n \n\n3.

The indices of anxiety and DA/ACh imbalance were qualitatively similar to withdrawal from morphine or nicotine, suggesting that the rats had become sugar-dependent.\n\nThis was confirmed by another study from 2008 that suggest sugar releases opioids and dopamine, therefore it might be expected to have addictive potential.\nThis has been proven in animal model, so it may translate to some human conditions as well causing eating disorders and obesity.\nSee also: Does having too much sugary things cause headaches?\n", "nutrition - Should I be worried about glyphosate exposure?": "\nGlyphosphate is an organophosphate compound that is used a herbicide - it is generally aimed at inhibiting enzyme synthesis in plants.\nGenerally, on oral intake from raw produce can produce toxicity, but the impact is low. [1]\nGlyphosphate formulations are usually mixed with additives that allow more rapid or easier transferral to the inside of plants, which can also increase acute toxicity in humans. [2]\nWith additives (which is how glyphosphate is usually in circulation) one of the more frequent problems is photocontact dermatitis due to preservatives used.\n[1] - https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.scitotenv.2017.10.309\n[2] - https://www.fs.fed.us/r5/hfqlg/publications/herbicide_info/2003_glyphosate.pdf\n", "first aid - Rationales behind the order of applying the torso straps of a Kendrick Extrication Device": "\nKendrick Extrication Devices (KED) are used during extrications (Such as in automobiles) where space is limited, and a backboard can't be used safely.\nGenerally the mnemonic for securing the straps is My Baby Looks Hot Tonight.\n\nMiddle\nBody (Torso)\nLegs\nHead\nTop\n\nIt is to be noted, that recently in the US, the recommended order is My Baby Looks Totally Hot, recommending securing the Top before the Head.\nSome of the reasons behind the order are that if the top is secured first, it creates uneven pressures (Think of a teeter totter, securing one end pushes the other away), and that securing one end does not prevent the other from sliding around. This is why torso and body are secured first.\nAccording to the wiki entry, there is no peer reviewed support for preferred strap order:\n\nAn exhaustive search of the literature for peer reviewed scientific data regarding the positive or negative effects of application of the K.E.D. straps in any specific order found no results. It is likely such data does not exist, and that there are valid arguments on both sides of the issue. However, best practices indicate that the manufacturer's directions should be followed whenever using any piece of medical equipment. That being said, whenever the EMS professional is in doubt about a medical procedure it is advisable to contact your local medical director.\n\nThe most recent user manual that I could find is dated 2001, and it recommends the MBLHT order of strap securing. I did find a clarification memo from the State of Connecticut dated 2009, which states that they will be following the manufacturers recommendation:\n\nTeaching and testing standards for long backboard and short spine board fixation sequences have always been clear. Criteria identified by the National Registry and observed by OEMS for several years have identified that the sequence for both long and short spinal immobilization\n  devices should be in the following order:\n\n 1. Torso fixation\n 2. Leg fixation\n 3. Head fixation\n\n\nMany of the commonly used EMT-Basic and Paramedic texts have also identified this sequence as the standard. However, the Kendrick Extrication\n  Device (KED) product manual suggests that the top torso strap be secured last, and after the head is secured. This apparent \u201cexception to the\n  rule\u201d may have contributed to student, instructor and examiner confusion. \nThe Office contacted the Ferno \u2013Washington, Inc., the manufacturers of the KED for clarification. Based on responses from Ferno spokespeople and effective immediately, the expected sequence of strap application in the Spinal Immobilization - Seated (if the KED is used) will be: Middle Strap, Lower Strap, Leg Straps, Head Immobilization and lastly the Top Strap,\n  as described in the Ferno KED user manual.\n\nHowever, these are all dating from up to 2009, and several forum postings from 2011 and later suggest that the order changed, and this is supported by the testing sheet currently in use by the National Registry for EMT's (NREMT) in the United States. \nSecures the device to the patient\u2019s torso\nEvaluates torso fixation and adjusts as necessary\nEvaluates and pads behind the patient\u2019s head as necessary\nSecures the patient\u2019s head to the device\n\nFurther supporting this is Mosby's Paramedic Manual which also specifies the head being last (Step 4).\nIn the absence of evidence to the contrary (Such as a current user manual), I would state that the current recommendation in the United States is the MBLTH order, with the head being last. (It is to note that this is different than when I was certified EMS, in that the Top was the last strap, not the Head).\nAs far as the differences between different countries/districts, I would posit that they are following whatever protocol exists, and it either was not updated, or there was a feeling that no update needed to be made in this case. Hardly definitive, but this is the most that I could find that is in any way current enough to be relative.\n", "nutrition - Are farm raised fish unhealthier than their wild caught counterparts?": "\n\nThe claim that farmed salmon have more PCBs than wild salmon is\ntrue.\nFor example, this paper from Science shows that the PCB (and other organic pollutant) concentrations are approximately 8 times higher in farmed than in wild salmon.\n\n\n\n\nThe claim that Omega-3 fatty acids are lower in farmed than wild\nsalmon is false.\n\nAccording to the USDA, farmed salmon has a higher concentration of Omega-3 fatty acids than wild salmon at 4.2g vs 3.4g for the default 1/2 fillet tested.\n\nThe claim that dyes are added to make salmon pink is true.\n\nThis paper describes an assay to measure astaxanthin content, which is one of the dyes added to the feed of farmed salmon.\n\nAstaxanthin is the single most expensive constituent in salmonid fish feed. Even though astaxanthin constitutes less than 20% of the total fish feed costs, control and optimization of the concentration of astaxanthin from feed to fish is of paramount importance for a cost effective salmonid fish production.\n\n", "nutrition - Are there health benefits associated with avoidance of gluten?": "\nThere are two main reasons why foods are made (or advertised) as gluten free. In short it is partially to meet the needs of a small but growing group of people who are allergic to gluten and also to catch people who are taking part in the gluten free fad.\nThe main reason is that there are different conditions out there that cause a person to have issues dealing with gluten one of them is a condition called celiac diease (WebMD/Celiac.org)\n\nCeliac disease -- also known as celiac sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy -- is a digestive and autoimmune disorder that results in damage to the lining of the small intestine when foods with gluten are eaten. Gluten is a form of protein found in some grains. The damage to the intestine makes it hard for the body to absorb nutrients, especially fat, calcium, iron, and folate.\n\nThis is something that can be a very serious issue for people that have it\n\nCeliac disease can leave a person susceptible to other health problems, including:\n\nOsteoporosis, a disease that weakens bones and leads to fractures. This occurs because the person has trouble absorbing enough calcium and vitamin D.\nMiscarriage or infertility.\nBirth defects, such as neural tube defects (improper formation of the spine) caused by poor absorption of such nutrients as folic acid.\nSeizures.\nGrowth problems in children because they don't absorb enough nutrients.\nCancer of the intestine (very rare).\nPeople with one of these conditions need to avoid all foods with gluten in them in order to avoid the effects of the condition\nThe second reason that food are made this way are because going gluten free has become a fad and food manufacturers are just cashing in on the latest trend.\nNow when it comes to gluten free food there are some things that you need to remember. First there are types of gluten free food.\n\nFoods that are naturally gluten free and just need to be advertised as such\nFoods that have gluten in them but easy changes can be made to remove it\nFoods that have are based primarily on gluten based products and need to be changed drastically in order to be gluten free.\n\nThe reason that knowledge is important is that people who have a sensitivity to gluten can easily have issue from cross contamination. An example of this would be if a pizza place was making a gluten free pizza but they used the sauce and ladle that is used on normal pizza which will bring in contaminates to the gluten free food.\n", "computers - Do vertical mice cause less stress on the hand, wrist and arm than traditional mice?": "\n\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is numbness, tingling, weakness, and other problems in your hand because of pressure on a nerve (median\n  nerve) going through your wrist. {1}\n\nPressure or swelling of the median nerve causes CTS and making the same hand movements over and over may induce swelling. The swelling can get even worse if the wrist is bent down (your hands lower than your wrists) or by making the same wrist movements repeatedly.\nThe ergonomic mouse serves to prevent people from holding their mice on the edge of their desks or other surface, which naturally rests in a manner that bends the wrist. The person has to keep their wrist straight in order to use the mouse, thus reducing swelling over time.\nIt can be annoying to adjust to an ergonomic keyboard or mouse, but they help keep the wrists straight, which can be a problem for anyone sitting all day at a computer.\nGiven what an ergonomic mouse and keyboard are supposed to do, there is little or no data to support the concept that activity adjustment prevents carpal tunnel syndrome. The study cited below has results that are inconsistent and non-conclusive. The researchers even state in their conclusion:\n\nSpeculative causal theories should be analyzed through a rigorous\n  approach prior to wide adoption.\n\n{The Quality and Strength of Evidence for Etiology: Example of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome }\n", "What is the minimum titer of typhoid?": "\nThe minimum infectious dose for a disease like typhoid is hard to obtain, because the most controlled method of obtaining this information is via human challenge studies, and those are essentially no longer performed due to some ethical issues. That means one must look at older data or observational studies, which have some methodological drawbacks.\nA somewhat older review suggests the necessary dose to provoke clinical disease was <10^3 organisms. Public Health Canada characterizes the infectious dose for enteric fever (which is another name for typhoid fever) as ~ 10^5 organisms.\nIn terms of which organs can be effected - in the most severe cases, complications can be fairly systemic, with the most dangerous complication being haemorrhage due to intestinal perforation.\n", "diet - Can typhoid occur multiple times?": "\nReinfection with typhoid fever is certainly possible.\nAn older human challenge study found that individuals with an induced infection were less likely to develop an infection if they had been previously infected, but 23% of them still developed a clinical fever. Another somewhat old study suggests that unless immunologically boosted, immunity to typhoid fever cannot last for more than ~ 1 year.\nEven immunity that arises from vaccination wanes and needs a booster after a few years.\nReinfection, regardless of the success of your treatment or diet, is very possible.\n", "infection - Is typhoid contagious?": "\nYes, typhoid is most certainly contagious. Indeed, one of the major figures in the history of public health, Mary Mallon (aka Typhoid Mary) is associated with this disease.\nThe only known hosts for Salmonella typhi, the causal organism for typhoid fever, are humans and higher primates, so it is definitely spread from person to person. This is primarily through the \"fecal-oral route\", wherein water or food contaminated with the bacteria from an infected individual's intestinal track is then ingested, proliferates, and causes illness.\nIn terms of preventing its spread, because of it's fecal-oral transmission route, the major methods are personal hygiene and sanitation. Hand washing, avoiding high risk foods (those that cannot be peeled, cooked throughly, etc.) are the usual steps to avoid enteric pathogens of all sorts. There is also a vaccine available, though it is not routinely administered in the United States nor heavily pushed by the WHO except in cases of \"prolonged exposure to potentially contaminated food and water in high-risk areas\", and does not provide complete protection.\n", "nutrition - Are bread molds dangerous to ingest?": "\nThere are a couple concerns with eating food with mold on it:\n\nThe growth of mold implies that microbial contaminants can grow on the food, which means there is a potential for spoilage even if the mold itself isn't pathogenic.\nThe mold itself can cause health problems. The USDA recommends discarding molded bread, as a \"bit of mold\" that is visible likely means a much greater penetration of mold in sub-visible amounts throughout the bread as a whole.\n\nThe most common health threats from the mold itself are likely exposure to mycotoxins or allergic reactions - consider, for example, that penicillin is a mold that can grow on bread, and also causes fairly serious allergic reactions.\nWhile the risk is likely small (you are exposed to tremendous numbers of molds in the process of going about your life), it's also fairly avoidable.\n", "hygiene - What are some ways to stop and prevent acne?": "\nWhile I cannot comment on the issue of laying on your back causing acne, I hope my answer helps with your concern for prevention. \nThere is some evidence that glycemic index (GI) is related to more severe acne. One study examining the diets of 287 people from ages 18-25 with no, mild or severe acne, found that those with worse acne had greater dietary (glycemic index). The foods which were significantly different among groups included servings of:\n\nSugar\nMilk (with non-fat milk having more of an effect than whole milk)\nSaturated fat\nTrans Fat\nFish (indicating higher fish consumption in those with no or less severe acne)\nFruit and fruit juice equivalents (presumably because fruit juice has added sugar making them high GI foods)\n\nThe authors propose that GI is related to acne development because of the effect on Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 or (IGF-1), but also highlight conflicting evidence. I will avoid further biological discussion of how this is thought to happen in the body because that is not your question.\nThe authors do propose that milk may be related to worse acne because it contains IGF-1 and its insulinemic response is much higher than would be expected because of its glycemic load alone so they hypothesize that the IGF-1 leads to (with a few steps omitted) greater sebaceous lipogenesis and sebum output, leading to acne.\nThe authors also comment on the negative relationship between fish consumption and hypothesize that n-3 polyunsaturated  fatty acids (omega-3 fatty acids) have a protective effect against acne.\nStudy limitations include that the data are self-reported as was the acne severity. \nA recent review of the dietary and acne literature indicated that there haven't been any randomized controlled trials that can conclude causally that high glycemic load, dairy and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have an effect on acne. The evidence is more convincing for glycemic load, and less robust or conclusive for milk and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.\nThe aforementioned data are inconclusive but worth taking note to see if reduction of these foods benefit your acne.

The answer to your question relies on the mix of guidelines as well as your specific situation.  I can only give you information in general (See above) but should not and cannot accurately say anything about you personally, obviously.\nIn general, if your pain is well controlled, then it seems like surgery would not really be something you want (there are obvious risks of head surgery).  So the question is what else would the MRI reveal that would change the course of your illness.  If for pain you would not need it, then what else?  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is certainly on the differential for many many symptoms, but if you and your doctor think it is highly highly unlikely based on your history, then it might not be something you want to formally rule out with an MRI.\nIf the concern is for a growing mass (such as cancer), the MRI can certainly be helpful.  \nThere is no great evidence for a person in your situation.  It will have to be a decision that you and your provider make after considering the risks and benefits.\nTo answer your secondary questions, your presentation is not consistent with MS diagnostically, as the McDonald criteria requires a person who has had more than 1 attack in just 1 clinically suggestive location, to have some kind of dissemination in SPACE.

Without further information, it would be hard to say in your case how unlikely it is that you have something that will progress to MS.

Also, addiction has been studied in relation of people's habit of eating food that is prepared with a combination of ingredients, as donuts or french fries, not separated ingredients. There are many studies that address the issue of excessive consumption of food as a real addiction, similar to that caused by drugs such as cocaine, heroin, alcohol and tobacco (Blumenthal & Gold, 2010; Moreno & Tandon, 2011).\nDr. Ifland identifies the refined products (sweeteners, carbohydrates, fat, salt and caffeine) as the substances that have the greatest potential to cause addiction. Our body is programmed to recognize sugars and fatty substances as fundamental for life and health: they're energy reserves and address us toward the consumption of fruit, rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals. With the refining of foods we have an exaggerated concentration of sugars and fats, and this disrupts our evolutionary adaptation (Ifland et al., 2009).\nIn the explanation of the mechanisms of addiction, there are at least three factors that contribute to the excessive consumption of foods. In the case of sugar and refined flour, part of the explanation goes through the concept of glycemic index: foods with high glycemic index - and load - cause a rise in blood sugar, which leads to an increase of insulinemia and subsequent hypoglycemia that is felt as hunger (Lennerz et al., 2013; Ludwig, 2002). Other explanations rely on the production of endogenous opioids caused by sugars that then would act as stimulants (Drewnowski, Krahn, Demitrack, Nairn, & Gosnell, 1992, 1995), and the lower efficiency of dopamine receptors, which would lead to increased consumption of food to achieve the same satisfaction (Wang et al., 2001; Wang, Volkow, Thanos, & Fowler, 2004). Lastly, a final interpretation refers to the fact that a high consumption of carbohydrates leads to increased levels of serotonin, which is perceived as a pleasant sensation (Wurtman, 1988).\nReferences\nBlumenthal, D.

A membrane of hydrogen ions doesn't make any sense chemically in any way.\nCooking doesn't change the overall charge of molecules in food, you can't create or destroy charges out of thin air. To change the charges, essentially the pH of your solution, you need to either add acid or base. Of course you do that quite often in cooking, but the cooking process itself can't change any charges by itself. And even if it did, stomach acid has a very low pH and will change the charges of food anyway. \nThe Kirlian photography is pretty, but that's it.

When you ingest something, if it is absorbed, it enters the portal vein which delivers the blood directly to the liver. There, the liver metabolizes, \"detoxifies\", excretes, synthesizes, and stores.\nWhat needs to be stored\nThe liver stores excess glucose in the form of glycogen, fat-soluable vitamins A, D, K, iron used for the synthesis of red blood cells, copper (used as an integral part of enzymes), fat, B12, and some other substances. (This is why eating polar bear liver results in hypervitaminosis A.) It does not store toxins.\nHow the liver \"detoxifies\"\nThe liver has a staggering number of metabolic pathways involving a series of enzymatic reactions that neutralize and solubilize toxins for excretion by the liver or kidney. It should be noted that some of the same enzymes are used to render \"pro-drugs\" into active drugs, and that delivery of absorbed molecules directly to the liver (where they may be converted or removed, called \"first pass\" metabolism) is the reason that some drugs simply are less effective or ineffective if taken by mouth. (The gut also is responsible for some metabolism.) This is so much a feature of the liver that first-pass metabolism of medications must be taken into consideration to determine the right dose of a drug.\nGenerally lipid soluble toxins are first made water soluble by any of a group of enzymes called the CYPs, e.g. cytochrome P450. Each of these enzymes has the potential to alter very many different toxins. Liver enzymes then add another water soluble molecule (called conjugation) to the toxin which renders it less toxic and water-soluable enough to be transported for excretion by the liver (with bile, which is excreted into the intestines and carried out of the GI Tract) or the kidneys (in urine).\nToxins can kill the host, injure a specific tissue (for example, an overdose of acetaminophen can cause enough liver damage to shut down detoxification leading to death), act as carcinogens altering DNA, be metabolized and excreted, sometimes be stored in adipose tissue (fat), or take other routes through the body. I personally know of no toxin (nor could I find one) that can bypass these things and be stored in the liver.\nThere are toxins that damage the liver: alcohol for example. Yet that doesn't get stored in even a damaged liver.\nClearly there are toxins everywhere that we don't even know about, but if drugs and toxins* studied are metabolized and excreted by the liver (or follow other routes), it stands to reason that the ones we don't know about are probably being handled similarly.\n*Disclaimer: Heavy metals are handled differently. Also, this answer doesn't deal with concentration of toxins in other tissues, e.g. fat. (Some toxins are stored in fat cells, and become mobilized again on weight loss.) \nMetabolic Detoxification\nFUNCTIONS OF THE LIVER\nThe Physiology of the Liver\nEffects of yo-yo diet, caloric restriction, and olestra on tissue distribution of hexachlorobenzene\n", "nutrition - Where can I find statistics about micronutrients deficiencies in European countries?": "\nThe most accurate data sets about nutrient intake of european population are linked to basically two sources:\n\nThe EPIC cohort study, involving more than half a million participants recruited across 10 European countries and followed for almost 15 years.

It may happen with any kind of direct trauma, including (perhaps the worst?) a broken toe. It is similar to any other injury causing bleeding; the major difference is you can actually see the dark blood because the nail is transparent.\nYes, it will disappear by itself, but as already noted by @JohnP, it will take a long time, as the clotted, thickened blood residue will be pulled towards the tip of the toe at the same rate that your toenail grows. \nThis is a picture of a subungual hematoma (SUH) after six months of growth:\n \nAs you can see, there is a nice, normal nail growing out. I will hazard a guess that this particular injury was a lot like yours by the ridge formed across the top of the new nail. This indicates that the nail was lifted slightly off the nail plate. Also, this is a very slow growing nail.\nYour SUH needs no treatment this far out. \nAs @JohnP noted, if there was significant injury to the growth plate, your nail may be permanently changed: it may be thicker, ridged, shorter, etc. But often this grows out without any problem.\nAcute care includes ice and elevation. If very painful, most doctors are capable of trephining the SH under sterile conditions (burning a small hole in the nail through which the blood may escape.) This sounds much worse than it is; in actuality, it provides immediate relief.\nBecause this was associated with trauma, it is a SUH. However, if it was not associated with trauma, one would need to consider a subungual melanoma, meaning a skin cancer under the nail. These can spread into adjacent soft tissue. Keep it in mind as it grows out; it should be replaced by fresh, unaffected nail. \nPhoto courtesy of John Chew via Flikr\nSubungual Hematoma Drainage\nEvaluation and Treatment of Subungual Hematoma \n", "hematology - How to deal with pale fingers in cold weather?": "\nThe phenomenon you are describing and the one shown in the picture is known as Reynaud's phenomenon.  In cold temperatures, the body constricts the peripheral blood vessels to prevent losing heat from the blood to the outside air.  In Reynaud's phenomenon, this constriction is exaggerated  and may prevent blood flow to the fingers or toes (and sometimes other areas) giving rise to the pale appearance shown in your picture.\nReynaud's phenomenon can be classified as primary or secondary.  \nPrimary Reynaud's phenomenon, often simply referred to as Reynaud's disease is where the phenomenon is not associated with any underlying disease, and the cause is ideopathic (unknown).  Primary Reynaud's phenomenon is considered to be a benign condition.\nSecondary Reynaud's phenomenon occurs when there is an underlying disease that is causing the condition, the most common of which are connective tissue disorders such as lupus (SLE).\nFor treating the phenomemon, your doctor will first want to ensure that you do not have secondary Reynaud's phenomenon, and if you do, the treatment will vary depending on the underlying disease.\nIf you are found to have primary Reynaud's disease, then there are also a variety of treatment options available that should be discussed with your health care provider.  Some of the options include:\n\nVasodilators - Vasodilators relax blood vessels increasing blood flow.  Creams such as nitroglycerin cream applied to base of fingers may help heal ulcers.\nCalcium channel blockers - Relax and open small blood vessels in your\nhands and feat, decreasing frequency of attacks.\nAlpha blockers - These drugs counter the actions of noradrenaline, a\nhormone that acts to constrict blood vessels.\n\nIn addition, your doctor will likely advise you to not smoke (as smoking is associated with lower skin temperature due to constriction of blood vessels), exercise more (as exercising can increase circulation) and control stress (which may help avoid attacks).\n", "diet - What are the health benefits of consuming oligonol?": "\nPossible Risks\nThis study suggests that Oligonol is safe for consumption and does not pose any proven threats or harmful consequences to health (1 & 2).\nPossible Benefits: \nOther studies suggest that its benefits may include reducing:\nvisceral fat (5),\nthe risk of mental degenerative diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's (6), stress-induced inflammation (7),\nand excessive sweating (8).\nThere's also possible correlation with strengthening the immune system (9).\nDisclaimers (Thanks JohnP!)\n\nThese studies don't suggest that Oligonol is a panacea, but rather\nindicate possible benefits.\nIn many of them, there are the same scientists cited as authors.\n(Sources 1 & 2) Conflict of Interest Statement: [The authors] are employees of Amino Up Chemical Co., Ltd. and BAM and AR are consultants to Amino\nUp Chemical Co., Ltd. - (A biotechnology company that produces nutraceuticals and functional food ingredients.)\n\n\nOligonol is a particularly promising source of\n  polyphenols since it provides higher concentration of phenolic\n  monomers and oligomers, and thus the bioavailability of these\n  polyphenols are higher, with potential for enhanced beneficial health\n  effects.\n\n...\n\nThe use of Oligonol to produce an antioxidant benefit in human beings\n  needs to be studied in future clinical trials.\n\n(See more: Links 3 and 4)\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17081671\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691508002949\nhttp://oligonol-net.com/e/publication/conference.html\nhttp://oligonol-net.com/e/applications/circulate.html\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464609000565\nOligomerised lychee fruit-derived polyphenol attenuates cognitive\nimpairment in senescence-accelerated mice and endoplasmic reticulum\nstress in neuronal cells.\nProtective role of oligonol from oxidative stress-induced\ninflammation in C6 glial cell.\nOligonol Supplementation Modulates Plasma Volume and Osmolality and\nSweating After Heat Load in Humans.\nOligonol supplementation affects leukocyte and immune cell counts\nafter heat loading in humans.\n\n", "herpes - Cold sores: why do we get them on the lips?": "\nFever blisters, or cold sores, are an infection with the type 1 or Type 2 herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, HSV-2).

It takes up residence in the roots of nerves; in the case of cold sores, it is a nerve near the cheekbone. In times of stress, fever, illness or even over exposure to sunlight, it can activate and travel down the the nerve and erupt as lesions in and around the lips.\nAll information contained here can be referenced through this government posting, however there is a huge reference pool available.

These are unsaturated fatty acids with one or more trans configuration double bonds. MUFA (monounsaturated fatty acids) and PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids), on the other hand, are good types of fat and oil components.Mayo Clinic\nRepeated reusing and heating oils to high temperature lead to formation of trans fats hence this should be avoided. See: Does Overheating Olive Oil Turn it to Trans Fat?\nTrans fats increase the risk of atherosclerosis (plaque formation in the walls of arteries) that limit flow of blood in vital organs like heart and brain (see: Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease). Trans fats are thought to be even worse than saturated fats for their propensity to cause atherosclerosis.\nThis leads to life-threatening conditions like myocardial infarction (heart attack), brain stroke and limb gangrene. Harmful health effects may also extend to other organs and diseases, e.g. Diabetes and Alzheimer.\n See: Dietary fats and the risk of incident Alzheimer disease. \nStudies show that it is possible to completely eliminate trans fats from foods. As a result there are limitation in many parts of world on use of trans fats (see Trans fat ban in NYC and this). \nFDA has made 2018 the year by which trans fat should be completely eliminated from food supply.NY Times\n", "computers - Does Apple\u2019s Magic Trackpad put more stress on the hand, wrist and arm than a traditional mouse?": "\nI have only anecdotal evidence; personally, I find the magic trackpad much better for most general purpose computing use and I believe it puts less strain on the whole lower arm structure.

Is that the case?\n\nIn a normal (i.e. lens intact) eye, that would, I think, be a problem.\nThe aqueous humor is a self-replenishing system, whereas the vitreous humor is made and completed before birth. There is no replenishment of it, although, because it is near a capillaries bed, there is diffusion of small molecules like glucose back and forth that takes place between the blood and the vitreous humor.\nYou're correct that the vitreous humor (initially a very well organized gel-like substance) liquifies as aging occurs, but the predominant effect of this is floaters (vitreous detachments*), retinal pulls, tears, hemorrhages and detachments.\n\nFluid (aqueous humor) is produced by cells in the ciliary body (which is part of the ciliary muscle, with ligamentous connections to the edge of the lens) behind the iris. This fluid-filled space is called the posterior chamber. The fluid then passes from behind the iris into the anterior chamber, between the iris and the cornea, and finally drains through a permeable network (the trabecular meshwork) near the base of your the anterior part of the iris. So, there is constant production and drainage of aqueous humor, keeping the fluid level balanced.\nWhen too much fluid is made, or not reabsorbed, the anterior chamber bulges, deforming the shape of the vitreous humor and placing pressure on the optic nerve. There is no fluid exchange between the two unless there is disease of the posterior chamber.\nWhen the vitreous humor liquifies, the volume stays the same. If it could drain out of the trabecular meshwork, I would imagine there would be a much greater risk of more serious vitreous detachments and subsequent  retinal detachments.\nIn the case of a lens removed in childhood, the vitreous humor, being a highly organized gel, is probably little affected by lens removal. With age, because liquifaction happens from the middle of the vitreous; the effect of loss of the lens is still probably small, but I imagine - I'm not an opthalmologist - it might be different for someone who has had a lifetime to accommodate. \n(I might have to read and edit this answer again.)\n*Not the sole cause of floaters\ncross-section image from Patient.co.uk: Acute Angle-closure Glaucoma\nhttps://www.dartmouth.edu/~humananatomy/part_8/chapter_46.html\nJ Clin Pathol. 2003 Sep; 56(9): 720: Concurrent vitreous disease may produce abnormal vitreous humour biochemistry and toxicology\n", "What to substitute for milk, in search of sufficient calcium and nutrition?": "\nIf you are eliminating milk only, then many of the other dairy sources still hold true as valuable sources of calcium. For example, an 8 ounce serving of fruit yogurt has ~ 300mg of calcium. This would also allow for cheese, which is also in the neighborhood of 300 mg for a 1.5 ounce serving. This makes it fairly easy to avoid milk.\nIf you eliminate dairy, then your three best sources out of native food are going to be canned salmon, sardines and tofu. The salmon and sardines have calcium because they have the bones included. Tofu is ground up soybeans, and it has about 800mg of calcium per 1 cup. The canned fish is 200-300 depending on the size of the can/serving, etc.\nHowever, what makes it easier is to add fortified foods to your list. A single cup of calcium fortified orange juice has 500mg of calcium. That gets you half way there, and if you make a turkey sandwich with enriched bread and throw on some kale you can easily get to your daily requirement.\nIf, however, you avoid enriched foods and all dairy, then you probably will need to either eat a lot of tofu or be prepared to eat a lot of varied foods. You can also consider supplements such as vitamins or similar.\nFor reference from a US based source, the University of California has a reference page on calcium in food, as does the National Institute of Health. Also, google will bring up nutritional information on foods when searched.\n", "ophthalmology - When someone with glaucoma sees rainbows around lights, what exactly is happening physically?": "\nThe so-called halos are typical for spikes of intraocular pressure rise in high-tension glaucoma (or ocular hypertension) forms, most often in melanin-dispersion syndrome (MDS, or pigment-dispersion syndrome) which is a trigger for glaucoma in myopes and often begins in early adulthood. \nThe halos appear when a spike in intraocular pressure leads to intracorneal edema, as the corneal endothelial cells which permanently pump the nutritious water out of the cornea cannot compete with the high pressure pushing the fluid into the cornea anymore. Thus, the cornea fills with water, leading to temporary loss of visual acuity and, as an early symptom, to halos and rainbows around sources of light due to increased dispersion of light. The regularity of the extracellular matrix, which is crucial for corneal transparency, is disturbed by the intrusion of water leading to cell displacement.\nBasically, this can happen in other forms of high-tension glaucoma or ocular hypertension with momentarily raised intraocular pressure (IOP), too. Note that it only does in forms where the IOP rises quickly, whereas in a slow and constant rise (as it happens in many forms of chronic glaucoma) the endothelial cells can adapt and still drain the cornea from the excess water. So basically, the same happens in an attack of angle-closure glaucoma, just with the difference being that angle-closure glaucomas often don't go away without medical treatment, whereas in early adulthood IOP spikes due to MDS the halos often are the only symptom which is often triggered by exercise or in dim ambience light situations. This is due to the fact that when the iris moves (as in widened pupils due to adrenaline reactions when performing sports or whe the lights are dim) in a patient with MDS, it rubs against the lens, loses pigment by erosion and this then clogs the eye's drain (in the anterior chamber angle).\nThis can be seen as basic knowledge in ophthalmology. A first report on the mechanism leading to IOP rise dates back to 1953. The induction of IOP spikes by exercise has also been known for a longer period of time.\nEDIT: As your question explicitly relates to open-angle glaucoma, I'd like to add that there are different types of open-angle glaucoma, and only some of them are known for IOP spikes that could lead to said halos and rainbows. Primary open-angle glaucoma usually doesn't, but other than the mentioned pigmentaray dispension syndrome, PEX glaucoma could, and herpes simplex trabeculitis is also not uncommon.\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology has a good description on pigmentary glaucoma in their EyeWiki.\nIt can be also found in Clinical Ophthalmology: A Systematic Approach, 7th Edition.

The body prefers to have higher blood pressure than to have a higher sodium concentration, as a high sodium concentration can be catastrophic and can lead to seizures and coma.\nThe mechanism behind the increase in blood pressure in order to control sodium concentration is as follows:\n\nThe increase in plasma osmolarity due to the increased plasma sodium causes the osmoreceptor cells located in the anterior hypothalamus near the supra-optic nuclei to shrink.  This shrinkage of the osmoreceptor cells causes them to fire, sending nerve signals to nerve cells in the supra-optic nuclei, which eventually transmit signals to the posterior pituitary.\nThis results in increased release of the hormone ADH (anti-diuretic hormone) from the posterior pituitary.  This ADH hormone then enters the blood stream, moves to the kidneys and increases the permeability of the collecting tubules to water, resulting in increased water resorption in the kidneys, leading to urine being more concentrated.\nThe net result is an increase in water resorption and an increase in blood volume and blood pressure.\n\nHigh blood pressure is associated with many adverse health effects, particularly cardiovascular disease, including stroke and myocardial infarction.\n", "alcohol - What are the hazards from smoking or drinking and then donating blood?": "\nSmoking and drinking both put the recipient of the blood donation at risk or possible risk.\nSmoking causes nicotine to enter your bloodstream and usually breaks down into cotinine.

The researchers note: \n\n\"These findings may give a clue as to the mechanisms by which nicotine\n  and cotinine from cigarette smoking increase vascular disease\n  progression and tumor growth and metastasis.\"\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1850669/\nAlcohol will immediately be absorbed through the lining of your stomach and small intestine into the bloodstream, meaning it will also be in the blood that you try to donate! {2} If your recipient happen to be a child, that alcohol can damage the developing brain and liver. {3}\n", "diet - Eating healthy and sporting, gaining weight": "\nJudging from your description, you're most probably doing everything correctly.\nBut ok, if you wanted to be absolutely sure, you really would have to precisely measure your calorie intake vs calorie expenditure (with a tool like cronometer or sth).\nAnd as far as gaining 100 grams in 2 days goes, that's just jumping to conclusions and easily falls within normal day-to-day weight fluctuations.\nI have personally lost almost 20 pounds in just 24 hours in a weight loss experiment - just to prove how much water weight can be lost (without burning off almost no body fat). And guess what...all that lost weight came back after just 2 days on my normal diet.\nIn other words, those 100 grams could easily mean you drank 1 extra dl of water, or that you didn't visit the toilet before weighing, or something similarly insignificant.\nThe only way to be sure whether or not you're gaining/losing actual body fat would be if you actually measured your body fat percentage...but even in this case, the measurements would not be precise enough to confirm what's actually happening if your weight changes by mere 100 grams.\n", "gallbladder - Gallstones pain relief?": "\nIf your abdomen pain in the upper right quadrant have been diagnosed as gall bladder stones and you are awaiting for surgery, I am very puzzled that you have not received a prescription for appropriate pain relief medication.\nIn Finland the drug of choice is Litalgin, which contains metamizole and pitophenone.

However, I am fairly certain that your numbness has nothing to do with your accident.\nWhen we are considering symptoms in limb and possible spinal injury the pathophysiology would be some kind of nerve or medullar compression in back causing symptoms in extremity. First of all, numbness you are feeling is not following any anatomical boundaries, ie. dermatomes (eMedicine).\nYou don\u00b4t specify exactly how you hurt yourself during the accident. For example, was there any forceful forward flexion in your lower back. Anyway, if you had injured your lower back in the accident, the most dreadful injury would have been a vertebral fracture. That would have been symptomatic instantly. We can rule that out.\nAnother likely outcome from the accident would have been some kind of injury or trauma to any of intervertebral discs in your lumbar region. Repetitive strain or forceful movement can cause deterioration of annulus fibrosus in those discs (Wikipedia). Weaking of annulus fibrosus would result to disc herniation some time after the accident if another forceful movement is targeted to lower back (MayoClinic).

The surgical options are aortic valve repair (valvuloplasty) or replacement with a mechanical or tissue valve. \nReplacement carries high risks (1 in 50 patients dies) as it is open heart surgery and also a risk the risk of blood clots and thus needs to be carefully considered, and patients need to take anti-blood clot medication afterwards. \nSources:\nMedlineplus on Aortic Insufficiency\nMayo Clinic on Aortic valve regurgitation (different name for aortic insufficiency) \nNHS page on aortic valve replacements\n", "nutrition - How do artificial sweeteners affect weight loss?": "\nThere has been a lot of debate over the topic of artificial sweeteners and weight loss. Some studies say that artificial sweeteners do promote weight loss, while others argue the complete opposite, that artificial sweeteners cause weight gain. \nDo artificial sweeteners in diet products affect weight loss?\nMost diet products use artificial sweeteners because they provide the sweetness of sugar without adding any extra calories. How this affects weight loss is uncertain. Several studies, both long term and short term, favor each side of the debate.\nA 1988 study1 had two groups of obese men and women. Both groups were placed on the same diet, except that one group had aspartame, an artificial sweetener used in some diet products, added to the diet. Both groups also had regular exercise instruction. The men in both groups lost a significant amount of weight in the 12 week period, while the women, who also had good results, had more of a difference in the two groups, with the group whose diet was supplemented with aspartame losing about four more pounds on average. This showed that artificial sweeteners can help weight loss, but because the group was small (59), no firm conclusions could be drawn. \nAnother similar study2 also showed positive results in taking aspartame. In a group of 163 obese women, some of them assigned to have products with aspartame and some assigned to abstain from it, it was shown that having aspartame promoted more weight loss and allowed more weight control during a follow-up period. This study had more conclusive evidence than the previous study, but still not enough to be considered definite.\nOne more study3 whose results leaned towards artificial sweeteners promoting weight loss (but still inconclusive) tested beverages with aspartame or high-fructose corn syrup (which I won't talk about because it's usually not used in diet products) on normal-weight men and women. The beverages with aspartame did appear, relative to when no beverages were given, to reduce weight in male subjects, but did not have a noticeable effect on females. Once again, this leaves us with an unsatisfactory result.\nAs I mentioned earlier, there are some studies that say artificial sweeteners don't have any significant effect on weight or sometimes even promote weight gain. \nA long-term study in San Antonio4 studied a few thousand people and asked them how often they drank beverages with artificial sweeteners. The amount of total consumption of artificial sweeteners was then estimated. About 7 or 8 years later, the subjects were re-examined and it was found that higher consumption of artificial sweeteners may be linked with a higher body mass index (BMI) and weight gain. There are many other factors that could've changed this result, and they were handled as well as they could, but still not perfectly. Because of this, the result is once again inconclusive. The study article even says, \"There may be no causal relationship between [artificial sweetener] use and weight gain.\"\nOne last study5 also says that there is no evidence that artificial sweetener consumption \"helps weight loss or prevents weight gain.\" It showed no significant link between weight loss or gain and the amount of artificial sweeteners consumed. Of course, this study has many variables that were handled as adequately as possible, but still this leads to the real result of the experiment being inconclusive. \nAs we can see, it is nearly impossible to tell how artificial sweeteners affect weight loss. They're not really bad for your health, so it is fine to have them. It does seem that the studies that showed weight loss from artificial sweetener consumption had a higher percentage of weight difference than the studies that showed other results. From this you may conclude that the benefits outweigh the risks. The only thing I can recommend is to have artificial sweeteners in moderation, just like anything else.\nIs there any benefit to choosing \"diet\" products instead over plain water?\nThis can also be a controversial subject, but there are also studies on it. Sadly, they are inconclusive.\nThis study6 tested men and women with two groups, one was an artificial sweetener beverage group and the other was a water group. Both groups also took part in a behavioral weight loss treatment program. The results showed that the artificial sweetener group lost more weight on average than the water group. Still, this study was not large enough and did not have sufficient enough evidence to be considered conclusive.\nWhether diet products are better than water can still depend. You can argue the same as above that the benefits of artificial beverages outweigh the risks, but you could also say that water is a safe enough choice. This is usually up to whoever is debating between diet products and water, but your doctor can be contacted if the need is really felt. \n\n[1]  An evaluation of the effect of aspartame on weight loss.\n[2]  The effect of aspartame as part of a multidisciplinary weight-control program on short- and long-term control of body weight\n[3]  Effect of drinking soda sweetened with aspartame or high-fructose corn syrup on food intake and body weight\n[4]  Fueling the Obesity Epidemic?

It leaves Why unanswered.Not knowing why or in what stage of rehabilitation (e.g. onset - surgical recovery) makes it difficult to recommend anything.\nThe big question being should you avoid putting stress on certain muscles or should you be exercising these muscles.\nWhen it comes to exercise the most important is to do stretch exercises and, very important, warm up before working out.  Rehabilitative exercise requires working with light loads with a minimum of two days between workout days.\nMinimizing stress on the lateral epicondyle while exercising the biceps should not be too much of an issue.  I would think the concern would be more about triceps (extensors) and biceps (flexors). These, being an antagonistic pair, the two need to be trained together or an imbalance could lead to injury.   \nThere are three muscles directly related to the lateral epicondyle: \n\nextensor carpi radialis brevis\nAnconeus\nSupinator\n\nAs shown in the first two images, the biceps are not in proximity to the lateral epicondyle or the medial epicondyle. Also notice the close proximity of the Triceps and Anconeus.  In the case of tennis elbow the injury is a result of the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle (top left center) which is associated with wrist extension and abduction actions.\nAnconeus assists in elbow flexation of the forearm and stabilizes the elbow when rotating the forearm.  It is associated its prime mover the triceps stabilizing the elbow during flexation.  Elbow extensions are ultimately achieved through the synergistic relationship between the triceps brachii and the small anconeus muscle. \n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many muscles in the forearm and the extensors are prone to repetitive stress syndromes (e.g. carpal tunnel).  Other lateral epicondyle related muscles are buried deep.\n\n\nBy dissecting the extensor muscles the Supinator muscle is revealed.\nSupinator always acts together with biceps, except when the elbow joint is extended. The supinator is less involved with rotation under heavy load. Under heavy load, the biceps take over. \nThe supinator is to the biceps as the Anconeus is to the triceps. \ntriceps brachii, which is responsible for extension of the elbow joint.\nBoth supinator and Anconeus stablize the elbow by way of the lateral epicondyle and are responsible for rotation of the forearm.\nThe abductor pollicis longus lies immediately below the supinator and is sometimes united with it.\n\n\n\n\nRotation of the Forearm is Key\nTo minimize stress on the lateral epicondyle you must minimize rotation.  To minimize rotation you must choose a biceps exercise that does not work a muscle associated with rotation.\n\nThe bicep Brachii is responsible for two motions in the elbow: flexion and supination (rotation). \nMany biceps exercises also work the brachioradialis which is related to rotation (supination) of the forearm. \nThe biceps brachii muscle alone does not directly affect the epicondyle.   To minimize stress on the lateral epicondyle care must be taken not to rotate the forearm when doing biceps exercises.  There are some biceps exercises to avoid as well such as the reverse curl and reverse pushdowns. You may want to avoid the reverse wrist curl as well. \nWhen the elbow joint flexes, a synergistic contraction of the brachialis and the biceps brachii is required.  \nOther muscles with tendons that attach near the lateral epicondyle.\n\nextensor digitorum\nextensor carpi ulnaris\nextensor digiti\npronator teres\npronator quadratus\n\nMany biceps exercises also work the brachioradialis which is related to rotation of the forearm. The brachioradialis is worked in arm and back exercises. The arm exercises include:\n\nDumbbell Curls\nHammer Curls\nPreacher Curls\nReverse Curls\n\nThe Back Exercises:\n\nReverse Chin Up\nLat Pulldown\nSeated Rows\nDumbbell Rows\nT-Bar Rows\n\nEZ-Bar and Cubitus Valgus\nCubitus Valgus is due to a lateral epicondyle  fracture or a common anatomical variation, where the elbow joint is twisted outward from the center of the body (cubitus valgus). This is where the forearm angles (carry angle) away from the body when the arm is fully extended downward with the palms facing forward.  This will cause barbell curls to be painful because the elbow joint angle causes the wrists to have to break excessively.  The solution is to use an EZ-Bar rather than a straight bar. A seated curl machine would offer greatest stability.\n\nBraces and Other Exercises\nI am not qualified to give advice for rehabilitation.  \ncheck out these guys:  Tennis Elbow Treatment\n\nSelect an Exercise that works only the brachialis and the biceps brachii and \nNOT brachioradialis.\n\n", "side effects - Are there any hazards associated with changing sleep schedules (shift work)?": "\nIt is difficult to know if your friend will experience adverse health affects associated with shift work, as everyone has different levels of tolerance for the effects of shift work.  Shift work however has been shown to increase the risk of some adverse health effects.  The following is a list of adverse health effects that have are commonly associated with those working shift work or working long hours:\n\nSleep\n\nScientific publications on the topic generally agree that working shift work or working long hours has adverse affects on sleep (1).  In particular the quantity of sleep may be reduced by up to 2 hours per day, with a reduction in REM and stage 2 sleep.\n\nFatigue\n\nIt is logical that decreased sleep will also lead to increased levels of fatigue.  Reports of fatigue among shift workers is very common, and remains an important, but vague symptom often a major cause of shift work intolerance.\n\nMental Health\n\nThere have been reports of increased anxiety and depression among shift workers.  The question of whether shift work causes increased psychiatric morbidity however is still an open question, as correlation doesn't always imply causation.\n\nCardiovascular Disorders\n\nScandinavian studies show that shift workers have a 40% increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including angina, hypertension and myocardial infarction.  It is thought this increase risk may be associated with disturbances in the circadian rhythm, increased stress, poor diet and lack of exercise.  \n\nReproductive Disorders\n\nThere is increasing evidence that shift work may lead to increased risk of spontaneous abortion, low birth weight and prematurity.\nThe risks of developing any of these adverse health affects from shift work may also depend on age, sex and personality.  Evidence shows older people are able to tolerate shift work less than younger people.\nReferences:\n\nHarrington, J.

However, the research focused on vitiligo, specifically looking at segmental vitiligo (NHS, 2013).\nThe NHS went further by saying that:\n\nThough the blame for the poor reporting of the study can be put at the door of the press office of the FASEB, which issued a\u00a0press release\u00a0almost entirely focused on the grey hair angle. This is a textbook example of public relations officers \u2018sexing up\u2019 a dry but worthy piece of research in order to gain maximum media coverage. And \u2013 credit where credit is due \u2013 they did an excellent job of that. Unfortunately, in doing so they obscured the truth.\nWhether peer-reviewed journals should be engaging in these types of disingenuous practises, which arguably damage the public understanding of science, is a matter of debate. However, FASEB are not alone in this, as recent research found that academics, journals and news reporters all share the blame for the\u00a0spin found in around half of all medical reporting. (NHS, 2013).\n\nWhat the NHS was reporting on was that there were a number of newspaper articles in 2013 talking about a 2013 study by one of the researchers in the 2009 study (Karin U. Schallreuter) - Schallreuter et al. (2013). Strangely enough, looking at the 2009 study, they also tested the theory on vitiligo patients.\n\nBy analogy, we turned to vitiligo, a depigmentation disorder, as this model could hold lessons for a better understanding of the graying process (Wood et al. 2009).\n\nIn explaining the problem, the NHS points out that:\n\nVitiligo can be divided into two forms: segmental and nonsegmental vitiligo. Nonsegmental vitiligo is the more common, in which the white patches that appear are symmetrical (the same places on both sides of the body, for example both hands could be affected). In nonsegmental vitiligo, two chemicals \u2013 hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite \u2013 accumulate in the skin.\nNonsegmental vitiligo can be treated with a pseudocatalase, which is activated by narrow-band UVB light. This reduces the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, allowing the lost skin colour to return.\nIn the less common segmental form of vitiligo, the affected skin lies in a dermatome, which is a particular area of skin supplied by a single nerve, so it usually affects only one side of the body.\nSegmental and non-segmental vitiligo can also co-exist, giving rise to \u2018mixed\u2019 vitiligo.\nThis study aimed to see whether the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite which occurs in nonsegmental vitiligo also occurs in segmental vitiligo, and if so, if the light activated pseudocatalase could also be of use in segmental vitiligo.\n\nThe bottom line is that, as far as I have seen, it has not been proven whether the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide is the cause of grey hair or not.\nReferences\nNHS (2013).

For example, Norovirus is actually the most common food-borne pathogen in the United States.\nAs for why not just calling it an infection, there are two reasons:\n\nIt is possible to get food poisoning from microbially produced toxins within food even without an active infection. For example, enterotoxins might be present in sufficient quantities to produce clinical illness even if the bacteria that produced them are dead.\nThe two are not mutually exclusive - food poisoning relates more to a common exposure source (food), and a collection of similar symptoms, such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting, and especially in mild cases, similar treatments. \n\nAlthough food poisoning may be caused by an infection, it's mainly a syndromic description of a disease.\n", "diet - Can consuming food that was cooked with olive oil have a negative impact on health?": "\nI seem to perceive some confusion in your question, and I'll try to clarify all doubts as much as I can. Olive oil is one of the best oils you can use to cook. It is mainly composed by monounsaturated fatty acids (1), that are neutral to cardiovascular risk and blood cholesterol. There are some oils that are better, by this point of view, like canola oil, that has a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, that are beneficial to cardiovascular risk. Some oils are worse, like palm oil, because of the higher proportion of saturated fatty acids, that are detrimental to cardiovascular risk. For the same reason you should also avoid margarines and butter.\nOlive oil has also a high smoke point (2), that makes it suitable for frying. Smoke point is the temperature at which toxic compounds are formed; it means that you should never heat beyond smoke point of any oil. This is the reason why the dangerousness of very hot olive oil is not something specific of olive oil, but of any oil that is heated beyond its smoke point.\nFinally, something that you should also be aware is that most of cooking oils are extracted with the use of hexane (3), a chemical solvent. Although the oil is subsequently refined, \"cleaned\", and the industry claims it's safe enough to be consumed, this procedure has risen a lot of concern.  \"Virgin\" and \"extra virgin\" olive oil do not involve the use of any solvent during the production; this characteristic is shared with other oils that are cold pressed. Cold pressing is an extraction technique that, additionally, preserves the chemical content of the polyphenols, antioxidants, and vitamins present in the oil, that are reduced by high temperatures. The regulation of the definition of \"virgin\" oils and cold pressing is different between countries.\nI apologize for my english, it is not my mother language. Here in Italy we speak a different language, and we know about oil.\n", "infection - Does chronic Lyme disease really exist?": "\nDoes chronic Lyme disease really exist ?

No, OTC drugs are not any safer than drugs needing prescriptions. They are more dangerous.\nThe rationale for this statement is that always when patients are given a prescription, a detailed dosing guidelines are given to patient. Also physicians make sure that the prescripted drug is suitable to use with existing medication without any adverse interactions.\nIn contrary, people can buy OTC drug as much they can and use them how ever they feel it is possible. Of course, majority of patients ask or seek for guidance, but in population level there will always be the minotiry who use OTC drugs with high doses and experience adverse events. \nThey reason why paracetamol/ibuprofen/aspirin are OTC drugs is that these  drugs have quite a few interactions with other drugs. Paracetamol is the safest minding the correct dosing. Daily dosage exceeding 4g are associated to liver damage. Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs cannot be used with warfarin, which is pretty much the only major interaction. Adverse effects include GE tract bleeding and kidney injury if daily dosage is high or there is pre-existing condition.\nThe rest of the drugs You mention are highly spesific drugs with complex mechanism of actions and they have many significant interactions and contra-indications. Proper assessment must done by a professinal and not by common people. \nIt varies from country to country and depends on local regulation which drugs are OTC. Usually the safest one are, like those you mention and for example antihistamins and some proton-pump inhibitioners. There must be an equilibrium which drugs are OTC and which are not. Certain drugs must be OTC so people can buy those freely and does not need to see a doctor every time they need paracetamol. That would pose a significant burden for health care system. Also, not all drugs should be OTC, most importantly those which have many major interactions and those which are suitable for abuse. Moreover, majority of drugs are used for treatment of chronic diseases so when people run out of prescription they must meet their doctor and thus the status of any illness can be assessed.\n", "side effects - Are steroids effective for treatment of ACEI-induced angioedema?": "\nUnfortunately the answer to your question is we simply do not know.  \nThere have been no trials of antihistamines or corticosteroids for ACEI associated angioedema and these treatments are of unproven efficacy and\nmay be ineffective, despite often be used as standard therapy.\nhttp://www.racgp.org.au/download/documents/AFP/2011/December/201112andrew.pdf\n", "dentistry - What are the possible health consequences of using whitening strips?": "\nI found a study which show that teeth whitening using Hydrogen Peroxide can cause oral mucosa irritation, burns or sensitive teeth.

Therefore, when axillary lymph nodes are removed, there is risk of developing lymphodema (swelling) in the corresponding arm.  This puts the arm at a greater risk of infection.\nWhen a blood pressure cuff is applied to the arm, the pressure of the cuff may further inhibit the drainage of the extra-cellular fluid in the arm, further enhancing the risk of the patient developing lymphodema.\nTherefore as a precuationary measure, it is not recommended to use a blood pressure cuff on the arm of the side effected by breast cancer.\nIt is also recommended that injections are not given, and blood not taken from the affected arm.  This is because the removal of axillary lymph nodes results in a higher risk of infection in that arm.\nReferences:\n\nPetrek JA, Pressman PI, Smith RA.

If there is reason to keep some pain sensation intact, the dentist will inform you, and ask at appropriate intervals if you can feel pain.\nThe efficacy of lidocaine and other local anesthetics depends on how closely your nerve distribution comes to the norm (they will inject the environs of the \"normal\" anatomical position of the nerve), how much anesthetic is injected, whether there are local factors which alter the local tissue pH (e.g. presence of an abscess or infection), how quickly it is removed from the site, etc.\n\nIs this feedback that the dentist can use to detect issues with the actual work as he goes along, or would the only purpose of reporting it be to try to get him to do something to mitigate it, for the sake of my immediate experience?\n\nLocal anesthetics prevent pain sensation, but not vibration or pressure, which themselves can be unpleasant. Hypothetically, a dental procedure which should be painless with anesthesia can be carried out equally well whether the patient feels pain or not, so if you are stoic, feeling pain and not telling your dentist will not likely affect the outcome of that procedure. However, informing the dentist helps them to know if your anatomy is different (valuable information for the next time they need to do a similar local or regional block, your response to the anesthetic used (they might try another anesthetic or approach in the future), or if there might be an unseen infection altering the pH (and efficacy) of the anesthetic. Therefore it is probably wise to let your dentist know what you're feeling. They can reassess the situation, then offer you relief of some kind: a painless injection (the second injection into an already partially anesthetized region is truly painless), nitrous oxide (a gas), or other.\nI would liken this for most instances to suturing a laceration. There is never a time when I wish the patient to feel pain while I'm addressing the repair. I address what I see. If a patient feels pain, I want to know that and address the situation.\nAn Update on Local Anesthetics in Dentistry \n", "nutrition - Does taking Vitmain B-Complex with zinc through tablets really help in reversing hair fall": "\nI found an expert answer for your question.

Iron overload occurs more quickly if there is concurrent alcohol use and iron consumption eg. using iron cooking pots.\nIn the asymptomatic patient with genetic hemochromatosis, then phlebotomy should commence when the ferritin exceeds 500 mcg/L and/or fasting transferrin saturation exceeds 50% ( though this value may vary depending where you are located ).  The reason that we monitor iron levels is that it is now apparent not all patients who test homozygous for a HFE mutation go on to develop iron overload.\n\nThe authors of several large population-based studies have performed hemochromatosis genetic testing on participants many years into the study and used stored blood samples to measure SF over time in participants found to have C282Y homozygosity.10\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u201315 These studies demonstrate that not all C282Y homozygotes, including those with an increased SF level, are destined to have progressive iron overload.16,17\n\nhttp://www.bloodjournal.org/content/116/3/317\n", "prevention - What steps can I take to prevent a seizure from occurring?": "\nI have found following peer-reviewed paper which provides a review of the nonpharmaceutic conservative interventions for the prevention of seizures:\nWolf P. The role of nonpharmaceutic conservative interventions in the treatment and secondary prevention of epilepsy. Epilepsia. 2002;43 Suppl 9:2-5. 1\nIt says (I have kept the essential parts):\n\nThe first step is the identification of factors facilitating the\n  occurrence of seizures. In the second step, strategies to control\n  these factors are developed. Most common are disturbances of the\n  sleep-wake cycle, especially reduction of sleep. Patients should\n  follow a regular sleep schedule with deviations of not >2 h. Sometimes\n  a sleep calendar is helpful. Night shifts are not compatible with\n  seizure prevention in these cases. (...) Other nonspecific\n  facilitators of seizures include uncontrolled use of alcohol and\n  extraordinary stress. Patients must learn how to cope with stressful\n  events.\n\nIt also provides some preventive measures for specific types of epilepsies:\n\nIn reflex epilepsies, specific precipitants of seizures are the\n  targets of interventions. Thus, most patients with primary reading\n  epilepsy begin to have, with prolonged reading, perioral reflex\n  myoclonias, which enable them to stop reading and thus to avoid a GTC\n  seizure. In photosensitive patients, seizures are often precipitated\n  by television. These can be avoided by viewing from a distance and\n  using a remote control, small screens in a well-lit room, and\n  preferably with a 100-Hz line shift. Environmental flicker stimulation\n  often comes unexpectedly, and it is advisable that the patients always\n  wear sunglasses in brightly lighted surroundings. Polarized glasses\n  seem to be more protective than plain sunglasses. If the patient has\n  only photically induced seizures, treatment by specific prevention\n  alone may be sufficient, but if spontaneous seizures also occur, drugs\n  must be given in addition.\n\nHope this helps!\n", "first aid - What should I do if someone has a seizure in front of me?": "\nThe typical scenario of a seizure is:\n\nloss of consciousness\nuncontrolled movements\nrecovery\n\nThe conduct to adopt during each of these phases follows:\nDuring 1. and 2.\nThe person will fall on the ground if standing and may get hurt, either due to the fall or due to the uncontrolled movements that will follow.\nThe only things you can (and should) do at that stage are:\n\nIf possible, ease the victim to the floor when falling, without restricting his/her movements. Be careful for yourself. Do not face the person (you could get punched, and even a thin person is very strong in such cases), stand on his/her back.\nShould the victim wear eyeglasses, remove them carefully. If you can, carefully loosen clothes or jewellery around the neck.\nInsert a cushion or some folded clothes under the victim's head. Here again, be careful not being hit and do not restrict the victim's movements.\nClear the area: remove any object that can be dangerous for the victim. \nBe calm and reassuring for people around. Ask them to stay away from the victim, or to go next room should this happen inside a building. Ask at least one to stay at your disposal in case of need. This may be useful later.\nMonitor how long this phase lasts.\nIf you're not aware of the victim's history with seizure, try to find any card or jewellery mentioning it.\n\nThere are things you should absolutely avoid doing as they would do way more bad than good:\n\nDO NOT hold the victim or restrain his/her movements. The victim may hurt him/herself, the only thing you should do is to secure the area as much as you can (see above).\nDO NOT insert anything into the victim's mouth. The victim is NOT going to swallow his/her tongue. \nDO NOT try to make the victim bite anything. No belt, no pencil, nothing. The victim may bite his/her own tongue, you cannot and should not try to prevent that.\nDO NOT move the victim, unless there is an immediate, real, and out-of-control danger.\nDO NOT leave the victim on his/her own. Don't stay too close, though. Be careful for yourself and get ready to do some more securing should this be needed.\n\nDuring 3.\nThe victim will not necessarily be aware of what happened, and will need time to recover. He/she might be disoriented/confused, and he/she may have lost urine during the previous phase. You should calmly expect both signs.\nThere are some do's and don't here, as well:\nDo:\n\nGently put the victim in recovery position (on a side: video and explanations here). \nAs long as the victim has not recovered consciousness, ensure the victim still breathes. To do this, approach your ear to his/her mouth, while looking at his/her chest, for 10 seconds. This allows you to hear the sound of breathing, feel his/her breath, and see the movements of his/her chest. Should you perceive none of these that's a medical emergency (potential cardiac arrest, which is another question1) - This is quite unlikely to happen but you have to check.\nWithout being intrusive, visually check whether urine seems to appear on the person's clothes. Failing to determine this is not a problem.\nDuring the recovery, speak calmly, be friendly and gentle. \nOnce the victim has regained enough consciousness, explain what happened and be reassuring.\nAsk the victim to show his/her tongue, and explain why. He/she can be hurt without knowing.\n\nDepending on what you know or discovered regarding the victim's history with seizure, and depending on the time the previous phase lasted, you may have to call the medical emergency services:\n\nShould the last phase (1. + 2.) have lasted more than 5 minutes\nShould this be the first time the person has a seizure\nShould the person have stopped breathing\nShould another loss of consciousness occurs \nShould another series of uncontrolled movements occurs\nShould the person remain disoriented after a few minutes of recovery\nShould the person be aggressive/violent\nShould the person be hurt \nShould the person be a pregnant woman\nShould the person ask you to call the emergency services\nOr should you have any doubt, assume you should call the emergency medical services.\n\nWhen calling the medical emergency services, \n\nDon't be in a hurry, stay calm.\nTell your name, phone number, current location,\nTell this is for a seizure, and tell the victim's gender and age\nDescribe the victim's condition, tell what of the above makes you call, tell whether there is a loss of urine or any injury.\nThey will guide you. Do whatever they tell you and answer any question.\nDo NOT hang up the phone before instructed to do so\n\nShould no emergency call be needed, offer some help to the person: \n\nLead him/her away from any danger, a quiet bench nearby is appropriate should you be outside. \nOffer him/her to call a friend, a relative or a cab.\nIn the US, and probably in some other countries, it's illegal to drive within 6 months after having had an unexplained seizure (not caused by eclampsia, hypoxia, head injury, etc.). Should this be the case, you don't have to force the person not to drive, but you can strongly discourage it.\n\nDon't:\n\nDon't speak fast or act in any way that could frighten the victim. Keep in mind the recovery phase is a slow process during which the victim feels dizzy and confused.\nDon't propose water or food before complete recovery or if you had to call the medical emergency services. In this last case, ask them whether you can propose anything.\n\n\n1- Being nonresponsive and not breathing triggers the CPR process. It is not described here as it is a question on its own.\n\nReferences:\n\nPremiers Secours civiques 1 (First-aid guidelines for general public), Ministry of Interior, France\nFirst-aid for seizures, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA\nWhat to do when someone has a seizure, the British Epilepsy Action Charity, Leeds, UK  \n\n", "neurology - Can epileptic seizures become life threatening?": "\nYes. Most seizures are brief, resolving spontaneously within 1-2 minutes.1 These are rarely fatal. On the other hand, status epilepticus is not infrequently associated with death. Status epilepticus (sometime referred to in shorthand as just status) just means a prolonged seizure lasting at least 30 minutes. It can also refer to a situation that is technically multiple seizures back-to-back, but without complete return to baseline in between. A recent review of status epilepticus quoted the statistic: \n\nThe overall mortality associated with status epilepticus approaches 20%, with generalised convulsive status epilepticus representing about 45\u201374% of all cases.\n\nHowever, it has long been recognized that it is very difficult to know whether the seizure itself or the factor that provoked the seizure is actually responsible for death.2 The strongest predictor of death from status is the underlying cause. For instance, in status attributable to hypoxia, death occurs over 50% of the time.1 That is because a seizure is likely to be provoked only by a pretty dire state of hypoxia \u2014 either not responsive to maximal interventions or occurring in a setting where such interventions are not available or not desired.\nTo the extent that death is directly attributable to the seizure, it is generally because of what doctors often refer has \u201cinability to protect the airway.\u201d Normal, conscious people have reflexes that \u201cprotect\u201d the airway at the level of the oropharynx to prevent aspiration. People having a generalized seizure lack such reflexes and can aspirate on their own oral secretions causing hypoxemic respiratory failure.  \n\n\nReferences\n \n\n1. Betjemann JP, Lowenstein DH.

You are probably hearing coil whine from the electronics -- switched-mode power supplies in particular tend to operate towards the upper end of the hearing range, and the intensity of this sound changes as the power consumption does (eg. when the imaging system goes from \"idle\" to \"active\").\n", "injury prevention - Chronic Hamstring Problem": "\nSoccer is a fairly injury prone sport. It's great that people are playing sports, but I've seen studies suggesting that it's the most injury producing of team sports, beyond even tackle football. Looking at Australia, here are some metrics being reported:\n\nThe rate of injury for football players is up to 35 injuries per 1,000\n  playing hours.\n\nThat's more than 1 injury per 30 hours of playing. Obviously a lot depends on what you refer to as an \"injury\", but either way the sport you're playing is notoriously hard on the body.\nA good strength training program would take you far though. While it may not stop your injuries, strength training will lessen the amount, make them less severe, and give you a better route through recovery. \n\nResistance training in addition to increasing muscular strength and\n  hypertrophy may also aid in the prevention of injuries. Research\n  indicates that resistance training promotes growth and/or increases in\n  the strength of ligaments, tendons, tendon to bone and ligament to\n  bone junction strength, joint cartilage and the connective tissue\n  sheaths within muscle. Studies involving humans and animal models also\n  demonstrate resistance training can cause increased bone mineral\n  content and therefore may aid in prevention of skeletal injuries.\n  Investigations to date suggest resistance training can aid in injury\n  prevention.\n\nI'd recommend a basic program like Starting Strength or Strong Lifts 5x5. Since you're paricularly having problems with your hamstrings, I'd supplement with a couple of exercises in particular:\n\nSingle leg Romanian deadlift. It's a big name for a relatively simple exercise, but I bet the first time you try it you'll topple over. Running and soccer are particularly single-leg sports: one is on the ground while the other is in the air. \nGood mornings. Do these after you've spent a few weeks doing one of the linked barbell training programs above. Initially, they will give you a wicked case of DOMS, so keep the weight lighter than you can possibly imagine: even an unweighted Olympic bar (20kg/45lbs) will be plenty. These are one of the more difficult exercises to perform, so buddy up with a professional trainer (maybe who can squat 2x their body weight), and have them check your form.\n\n", "Where is the WHO definition of (very) low birth weight?": "\n\nA low birth weight baby is one that weighs less than 2500 g at birth. As growth is a progressive process, a baby may weigh less than 2500 g at birth because it is born too soon, or because it is small for its gestational age.\n\nFrom here: http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/fetomaternal/9241594004/en/\n\nLBW infants are classified as very low birth weight (VLBW) if their birth weight is less than 1.5 kg, and as extremely low birth weight (ELBW) if their birth weight is less than 1 kg.\n\nFrom here: http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/9789241548366.pdf\nThese are not necessarily the original sources of those classifications - neither one is cited, so it's not even necessarily possible to follow that definition backwards along a citation path, but those are both official WHO documents.\n", "Difference between taking tissue of cancer from secondary place or primary place": "\nI would disagree a bit with the previous answer. There are absolutely differences between the metastasis and the primary tumor. One result of this is that people very rarely die of primary tumors, but rather from the metastases of those tumors. The primary tumors will be quite heterogeneous and contain largely cells that have not undergone steps necessary for migration like epithelial to mesenchymal transition. After cells have metastasized they will be separate from the original primary tumor, and contain unique genomes. Because this is the more 'progressed' group of cancer cells, these are often the cells that need to be targeted. So, determination of the proper treatment strategy should be done on the metastasized cells.\n", "nutrition - Role of Omega-3 in exercise induced bronchospasm?": "\nSince all of the studies on this specific product seem not only mussel-like but downright fishy when reporting large effects the following is a bit speculative and just assumes that it actually works:\nTwo aspects of action seem possible:\nEIB is often seen as  \"even cases of asthma in which exercise appears to be the only trigger of bronchial obstruction (pure EIA) may be manifestations of chronic inflammation of the airways.\"\n\nThe clam-extract is said to contain 30 PUFAs and especially the Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. When the ratio of Omega-3 is moved towards the optimum it is commonly believed to reduce inflammation.\nOmega-3 fatty acids and inflammatory processes: from molecules to man.\nThe extract is said to be an inhibitor for the 5-lipoxygenase pathway and might therefore be called an antileukotriene.\n\nThe product differs from what was marketed as an anti-arthritis medication which largely proved unsuccessful. If the main action is indeed from the PUFAs then I wonder how much exactly is in those pills and why it should not be possible to use the PUFAs  and other inflammation reducing foods from other sources. A more optimised ratio of fatty acids is advised anyway.\n", "eye - What are the main causes of myopia?": "\nNature ran an article The myopia boom last month, focusing in the explosive increases in cases of myopia in many countries (with some Asian countries going from ~20% in 1940 to ~80% in 2010).\nThe precise cause is not determined with certainty, but there is a very good correlation between developing myopia and spending time indoors:\n\nResearchers have consistently documented a strong association between measures of education and the prevalence of myopia.\n[...] \none in five of the children had developed myopia, and the only environmental factor that was strongly associated with risk was time spent outdoors\nchildren who spent more time outside were not necessarily spending less time with books, screens and close work. \u201cWe had these children who were doing both activities at very high levels and they didn't become myopic,\u201d\n\nThe proposed mechanism for this is the lack of light:\n\nRetinal dopamine is normally produced on a diurnal cycle \u2014 ramping up during the day \u2014 and it tells the eye to switch from rod-based, nighttime vision to cone-based, daytime vision. Researchers now suspect that under dim (typically indoor) lighting, the cycle is disrupted, with consequences for eye growth. \u201cIf our system does not get a strong enough diurnal rhythm, things go out of control,\u201d says Ashby, who is now at the University of Canberra. \u201cThe system starts to get a bit noisy and noisy means that it just grows in its own irregular fashion.\u201d\n\nBut this is the subject of on-going research, and not everyone agrees. Other factors may also play a part:\n\nSome researchers think that the data to support the link need to be more robust. \n[..]\nHe says that the greater viewing distances outside could affect myopia progression, too. \u201cLight is not the only factor, and making it the explanation is a gross over-simplification of a complex process\n\n", "nutrition - Is high fructose corn syrup bad for you?": "\nDefinition:\n\nThe term \"high fructose corn syrup\" is not a good descriptor of its\n  composition, but the term was mandated to distinguish the newly\n  developed fructose-containing corn syrup from traditional all-glucose\n  corn syrups. Factors that may account for the different effects of\n  fructose alone or a mixture of fructose and glucose could be its\n  gastrointestinal effects and absorption characteristics. (5)\n\nThe Problem\nToday we have too much access to energy that we don't need. This leads to the problem of obesity when people consume too many calories, pointing towards higher risks of cardiovascular diseases.\nThe Possible Culprit\nHigh Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) contributes to this problem because when consumed, it does not stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin. In animal models, it even induces insulin resistance, leading to diabetes (1).\n\n\"the long-term consumption of diets high in fat and fructose is likely\n  to lead to increased energy intake, weight gain, and obesity\" (1).\nAdditionally, when ingested by itself, fructose is poorly absorbed\n  from the gastrointestinal tract, and it is almost entirely cleared by\n  the liver since it's absorbed through a different system than glucose.\n  This puts more work on the liver. (2)\n\nFurthermore, HFCS \n\n\"did not suppress circulating ghrelin, a major appetite-stimulating\n  hormone\" - (2)\n\nSo even though you're taking in a massive amount of energy and overworking your liver, you don't feel full, which causes you to keep eating and drinking.\nFor runners and other endurance athletes, this is ideal. They can store up massive amounts of energy without the need to stuff themselves until their stomachs are nearly exploding. For people who burn a massive amount of energy on a regular basis, HFCS comes as a good source for replenishing and preparing that energy for usage, but for everyone else who doesn't burn high levels of calories, this indicates a high influx of potential energy without anywhere to go. \nThe Counter\nThis short-term study notes,\n\n\"There were no differences in energy or macronutrient intake on day 2.\n  The only appetite variable that differed between sweeteners was desire\n  to eat\" (4)\n\nAnother study notes that most of the testing has been done on rats, whereas in humans, \n\nfor people with insulin resistance, diets\n  with 50 grams or more per day (high consumption) may result in\n  elevated triglycerides, but there is no effect with normal levels of\n  fructose consumption. (5)\n\nThe Caution\n\nFructose is poorly absorbed from the digestive tract when it is\n  consumed alone, but absorption improves when fructose is consumed in\n  combination with glucose and amino acids. In addition, the principal\n  sweetener in soft drinks in the US, HFCS, is not pure fructose but a\n  mixture of fructose (55%) and glucose (45%). HFCS is predominately\n  present as HFCS-55 (55% fructose, 41% glucose, and 4% glucose\n  polymers) or HFCS-42 (42% fructose, 53% glucose and 5% glucose\n  polymers) (5).\n\nStudies on humans hasn't been substantial enough to develop hard evidence. In fact, one of the studies indicates that fructose increased appetites while another claimed it inhibited appetite! \nIf there's one thing that seems highly possible right now, it's that high fructose corn syrup gives energy, whether you need it or not. Since most people don't, that contributes to possible obesity (3).\nSources: \n(1) Fructose, weight gain, and the insulin resistance syndrome\n(2) How bad is Fructose?\n(3) A sweet problem: Princeton researchers find that high-fructose corn syrup prompts considerably more weight gain\n(4) Effects of high-fructose corn syrup and sucrose consumption on circulating glucose, insulin, leptin, and ghrelin and on appetite in normal-weight women.\n(5) Health implications of fructose consumption: A review of recent data\n", "computers - Do using trackballs put more stress on the hand, wrist and arm than a traditional mouse?": "\nI am currently using a logitech ambidextrous trackball and I am starting to develop pain for clicking with the thumb.

There does not seem to be a perfect solution.\n", "Do professional massages have any health benefits or do they merely feel good?": "\nThere are a couple of studies that show massage will help with delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) after exercise, but that it doesn't really impact range of motion (ROM) or peak maximal force.\nThis study used a small cohort of 5 males, 5 females, doing arm exercises designed to produce DOMS. One arm got massaged, the other didn't. They self reported less DOMS in the massaged muscle, but it showed no impact on ROM or peak force.\nThis study followed a similar path, examining hamstring contractions with a slightly larger group of 18. Each leg was exercised, and only one was massaged with similar results to the first study I cited.\nSo yes, massage can reduce some of the after effects of intense exercise sessions, it hasn't been proven to actually improve performance.\n", "Facial hair hygiene recommendations": "\nThere are a few other active ingredients you could try for dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis), if that's what's causing your problem.

Howecer, if you do shave the beard and the condition resolves itself, it may be time to rethink the beard. :(\nIf none of those work, it's probably best to see a doctor about it.

There are actually a number of resources out there that answer this question. Here is a very dry (but unbiased) answer from the Canadian Paediatric Society written for paediatricians who are helping parents with this issue. \nHere are some quick question to ask yourself when appraising the website you're looking at:\n1) Most importantly, whose website is it? The most reliable are generally university or health agency websites. Next would be not-for-profit professional organizations (for example the American Academy of Cancer Researchers or the American Medical Association). Be wary of for-profit organizations and websites run by one individual or a small group of individuals.\n2) Is the information referenced and peer reviewed? An unreferenced statement is useless. Even if it's referenced, the reference should ideally point to the peer reviewed literature, not to a secondary source (such as a news site).\n3) Is the website itself peer reviewed? This isn't mandatory but it helps you have trust in the website.\nIf you have the background you can go to the references and evaluate the literature itself - is the population described relevant to you? Was the intervention what you were looking for? This is advanced and probably unnecessary if you follow the other rules (especially number 1).\nThe bottom line is that reputable organizations are likely to have accurate information. The NIH, CDC, or Mayo Clinic will always be more reliable than a single person's website (no matter who they are). Look for .gov or .edu at the end of the URL - these are reasonable indicators that the information has at least been vetted by more than one person.\n", "obstetrics - How much Vitamin B12 do you need?": "\nThe estimated daily requirement needed to maintain body stores of B12 varies, an estimate being from 2\u00b5g to 5\u00b5g, more if stores have been depleted in any way.

The recommended daily allowance assumes a 50% absorption rate of ingested B12.\nThis is a good question to discuss the limits of medical science. How is the requirement for B12 determined?\nLongitudinal studies are those that follow people over many years (even decades.) Humans are not subjected to longitudinal studies involving, say, B12 because:\n\nit would be unethical to withhold from some subjects a vitamin necessary for health and well-being while providing it to others just to get an exact number (for the sake of scientific curiosity)\nthere are ethical issues in involvement of the young (parental consent should not extend to potential harm)\nif participants are paid volunteers, the study introduces a bias in recruitment (more poor people?)

They would either be forced to eat meat or drop out of the study) \nlongitudinal studies suffer from cumulative attrition - people die of unrelated causes, move to another area, decide to drop out for other reasons, etc.\n(many more problems)\n\nTherefore different study models must be used, which give us less accurate information, such as retrospective studies, animal studies, studies of treatment of pernicious anemia (a result of B12 deficiency), pregnant and lactating vegans, people who have undergone certain bypass procedures, etc. By studying those patients, it can be determined how much B12 is necessary to the first signs of B12 deficiency away (usually apparent in blood).\nB12 is a particularly difficult vitamin to pin down because of its\ncomplexity, the fact that it is synthesized by intestinal flora, and the various steps involved in its absorption which might be influenced by age and other factors.\nAgain, the estimated daily requirement of B12 varies from ~ 2\u00b5g to 5\u00b5g.\nSince there are no known adverse effects of excess B12 intake, it's not unreasonable to take more than the minimum if warranted. However, a recommendation of 500 - 1000 \u00b5g/day seems quite unnecessary.\nTietz Fundamentals of Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics (Carl A. Burtis, David E.

However, that doesn't mean that you will have gained one permanent pound. The body will break down the food, distribute the end result to various places for either use or storage, and get rid of whatever is not digestible.\nWeight fluctuates during the day, so the best gauge of your weight is to weigh yourself at the same time every day, under the same conditions. Track that number, and that gives you your true weight.\nAlso, weight gain/loss is a relationship between how many calories you need to sustain your day to day activities, and how many you eat. If you consistently eat more calories than you need for a day, then you will gain weight. If you consistently eat less, then you will lose weight. The rate at which you do so varies on how big the deficit/surplus is, how efficient your metabolism, type of calories, many factors such as these.\nFor your main question, 3500 calories per pound of food is very calorie dense. For example, 1 lb of peanut butter is going to be ~ 2600 calories. The higher the fat content, the closer you get to that mark. If you ate a straight pound of fat, for example, you would get just over 4000 calories. (Using the typically accepted 9 calories per gram of fat, which is also not 100% accurate). So yes, it is possible to get more than 3500 calories in a pound of food.\n", "nutrition - Does 3500 calories really equal a pound?": "\nThe original 3500 calorie theory comes from a correspondence published in 1959, by a Dr. Max Wishnofsky, where he equates it to pounds lost in observed obese patients.\nIt's further perpetuated by badly applied mathematics. White adipose tissue has the responsibility for energy storage in the body. This tissue is composed of anywhere from 60% to 85% lipid (fat). If you take the commonly accepted 9 calories of energy per gram of fat (Which is also not quite accurate), you get the following formula:\n9 (calories/gram) * 454 grams (grams in a pound) * .85 = 3465 calories.\nSo, the original estimation was that there were 3500 calories in a pound of human fat, so to lose a pound you had to burn 3500 calories. Since this \"makes sense\", it was widely repeated and used, and became entrenched. It is not accurate, and implying that to lose a pound of fat you have to burn exactly 3500 calories is erroneous.\nEdit: While researching something else, I came across this article, titled \"Farewell to the 3500 calorie Rule\", on Today's Dietitian website. One paragraph from the article:\n\nIt's been estimated that the 3,500-calorie rule is cited in more than 35,000 educational weight-loss sites.1 In September, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a patient handout titled Healthy Weight Loss, in which the first sentence states, \"A total of 3,500 calories equals 1 pound of body fat. This means if you decrease (or increase) your intake by 500 calories daily, you will lose (or gain) 1 pound per week.\"2 Undoubtedly, the 3,500-calorie dogma still is being taught even though it's been shown that it simply doesn't work this way. So where did the 3,500-calorie weight-loss wisdom come from? It originated from researcher Max Wishnofsky, MD, in 1958, who calculated that 1 lb of fat stores approximately 3,500 kcal of energy.3 It was appealingly simple, and it stuck.\n\n", "digestion - Can a person eliminate lactose intolerance through extended exposure?": "\nVery generally speaking I would say it depends on the cause of the intolerance - if it is a primary intolerance (i. e. genetic problem with lactase persistence deficiency, the enzyme for digesting lactose) no additional exposure will cause a change in genetics. Another genetic form of lactose intolerance prevents forming of lactase enzymes.\nSecondary intolerance is acquired, i. e. not genetic in origin. Acquiring it usually is accompanied by some sort of intestinal inflammation and is thought to be reversible.\nSome more details on this can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance#Causes\n", "allergen - How does the body develop an allergy during a lifetime?": "\nFrom the MayoClinic, it isn't clear why adult allergies develop:\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/food-allergy/expert-answers/food-allergy/faq-20058483\nHowever, there is evidence that food sensitivities develop when someone has a compromised gut. If the gut is compromised, undigested food particles \"leak\" into the blood stream and the body creates antibodies against this undigested food.  These sensitivities can disappear if the gut is repaired.\nhttp://www.holistichelp.net/blog/why-do-food-sensitivities-develop-and-spread/\n", "allergy - How do antihistamines work?": "\nA very brief review of an allergic response is in order so that the answer makes sense. Think of a linked chain of events here.\nAn \"allergen\" is something a person is allergic to, e.g., cat dander or pollen. When someone is exposed to an allergen, they either become allergic or not.\nIn a susceptible individual, something in the allergen (called an antigen, usually a protein of some kind) causes the person's immune system to produce an antibody (or Immunoglubin, in this case Immunoglobin E, or IgE) to the antigen, which then circulates throughout the entire system. The individual is now considered \"sensitized\". The IgE's bind to receptor sites on mast cell surfaces.\nWhen a sensitized individual is re-exposed to the antigen, the antigen binds to the IgE's changing the cell surface, triggering a response.\nMast cells, found in connective tissues throughout the body - but especially in mucus membranes and skin - make and store a molecule called histamine. When the antigen binds to the IgE's on the mast cell, the cell is \"signalled\" to release (among other things) histamine, a molecule which causes local capillaries to swell and leak fluid: the typical runny/stuffy nose, red/itchy/watering eyes, etc.\nSo that's a basic allergic response involving histamine.\n\nIs the antihistamine doing something regarding his immune's system reaction or is it doing something about the symptoms? How does it work?\n\nThe antihistamine essentially blocks the effect of histamine on the capillaries. It doesn't decrease his immunity to the antigen (it doesn't stop IgE from being produced); it just treats the symptoms (stuffy nose, watery eyes, etc.)\n\nWill his immune system learn how to behave whilst taking antihistamines? Would the process of learning be better or worse for taking them?\n\nThe antihistamine will have [little or]* no effect - either positive or negative - on his immune system. It is used only to make the allergic symptoms more tolerable.\n\n*The immune system is so incredibly complex, many things are still being worked out. I would not categorically rule out some kind of modulation, but for all intents and purposes, this is not what antihistamines are used for.\nImage from The Asthma Center\nHistamine and H1-antihistamines: Celebrating a century of progress\nIgE and mast cells in allergic disease\nJaneway, Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease. 5th edition\nHistamine and H1-antihistamines: Celebrating a century of progress\n", "prevention - What would happen if a person used Flea medicine on themselves?": "\nMany of the active ingredients in flea and tick powders are harmful to humans, or suspected of being carcinogenic, or have effects on the nervous system.\nThe Humane Society has a page on OTC flea and tick products, one of the sections details a couple of these effects:\n\nBesides pyrethroid-based products, ingredients to be wary of are organophosphate insecticides (OPs) and carbamates, both of which are found in various flea and tick products.  The only OP currently found in flea and tick products in the U.S. is tetrachlorvinphos.  This chemical is classified by the EPA as being \"likely to be carcinogenic to humans.\"  There are questions about the effects of long-term, cumulative exposures as well as combined exposures from the use of other products containing OPs and carbamates.  Permethrin is another chemical that the EPA has classified as \"likely to be carcinogenic to humans\" if ingested orally.\nIf the ingredient list includes carbaryl or propoxur, the product contains a carbamate.  According to the NRDC, the potential dangers posed by thee products are greatest for children and pets.  Propoxur is considered to be a \"probable human carcinogen\" by the EPA.  As of September 2010, Carbaryl will no longer be permitted for use in new pet products.  However, existing stock of flea/tick products containing carbaryl can still be sold.  The HSUS recommends that pet products containing carbaryl should be disposed of and not used on pets.\n\nAdditionally, one of the current varieties of powder (K9 Advantix II) has the following warning on it's website for the product:\n\nHazards to Humans: Warning. Causes substantial but temporary eye injury. Do not get in eyes or on clothing. Harmful if swallowed. Harmful if absorbed through skin. Avoid contact with skin. Wash thoroughly with soap and water after handling and before eating, drinking, chewing gum, using tobacco or using the toilet. Remove and wash contaminated clothing before reuse.\n\nSo there are a host of possible side effects, from possible nerve damage up through it being a possible carcinogen. I would not advise using them on yourself.\n", "Is this study stating red algae reduces cold virus by 92% believable?": "\nLooking at this from the perspective of an infectious disease epidemiologist, the kind of person who often reads (and occasionally runs) studies of this type, I'm skeptical. A number of reasons why:\n\nThe only results are a synopsis. More details and data are apparently available, but there is no manuscript, and their \"Transparency Policy\" has a lot of caveats in it.\nIt's not a peer reviewed study.\nTheir treatment protocol is oddly variable - 4 mandatory days plus a possible additional six days based on...?\nAgain, since they're not providing tables, this gets a little frustrating to try to consider, but their treatment arm is fairly heavily skewed toward women - they claim it's similar in the control arm, but they won't show you how similar.\nThey fail at their primary endpoint, being the mean number of symptoms reported between the treatment and control. The mean number of symptoms are about half-a-symptom less between the treatment and control arms, but the result isn't statistically significant, they do some statistical adjustment I'm a little skeptical of - because they don't describe it - and they end up using somewhat...loose...language like \"was a strong trend in favour of Bisolviral\u00ae.\"\nThis is all based on patient self-report of symptoms, and interestingly, there's absolutely not an effect for self-reported assessment of efficacy between the treatment and control arms. Further, looking at viral load assays, there's also no biological evidence that anything is happening.\n\nI can't find the specific language about the 92% claim you cite in your question, but my assessment of the overall evidence that this compound works would be \"Faint and preliminary, at best\".\n", "ergonomics - Exercise Ball Vs. Desk Chair": "\nThere are actually studies about sitting in a regular chair vs. an exercise ball. Here and here for example. Neither seems to show net benefits. The limitations of both studies are small sample size and short time period of observation.\nAnecdotally, I know at least two people who both have done it and they seem happy with it (but this is recent, so I can't speak for long term use).\nA few considerations:\nHeight - With an exercise ball, you will not be able to vary its height. So if it's fairly low relative to your desk, you might be forced to straighten your back. If it's too high you might end up curving your spine.\nArm rests - Just from experience, I find that in chairs without arm rests, my shoulders are less slouchy, and my back is a bit straighter. I don't know to what extent this makes a difference for you or others, but keep it in mind.\nSoft vs. hard seat - I wonder how this influences blood flow to your legs, other parts of the body, and if it also affects posture.\n", "What do bags under the eyes mean, and what causes them?": "\nTo the best of our knowledge, it just happens to some people and it's harmless. \n\nWith aging, the tissues around your eyes, including some of the muscles supporting your eyelids, weaken. Normal fat that helps support the eyes can then move into the lower eyelids, causing the lids to appear puffy. Fluid also may accumulate in the space below your eyes, adding to the swelling.\n\nUnless there are additional symptoms, like itching or redness of the eye, there is no cause for concern. Some things can make it worse, like hot weather, and some things can make it look worse on some people, like people with very light skin. \nThe medical expression is \"mild periorbital swelling\", by the way. Searching for it in medical databases will mostly lead to getting information on the rare cases where it was a symptom of a serious illness, though. \nSources:\nMayo Clinic\n", "sexuality - What are the pros and cons of a glycerin based personal lubricant?": "\nDisclaimer: Some of the sources in this post should likely be considered \"Not Safe for Work\".\nGlycerine-based lubricants, which are likely the most common form of water-based lubricants on the market (consider, for example, Astroglide or K-Y) have a number of positive properties to them (when compared to silicon or oil-based lubricants):\n\nThey are safe for use with latex-based condoms. Oil-based lubricants can have negative impacts on both slippage and breakage of condoms, which is of course a bit of a problem, as presumably that condom is meant for either pregnancy prevention or disease prevention, both of which rely on an intact and in-place condom.\nSimilarly, they are safe for use with toys of various sorts. Some silicone-based lubricants can interact with silicon-based toys.\nBecause they are water based, they are relatively easy to clean.\n\nThere are also a number of drawbacks, compared to alternatives:\n\nAs they are water based, they can become tacky over time, and when used in water, may wash off, resulting in an essentially unlubricated surface (water has this same effect on vaginal secretions).\nThere is some suggestion that these products are associated with an increased risk of yeast infections when used vaginally, but at least one study did not find such an effect.\nThere has been some noted damage to cellular tissue from the use of some lubricants, as they may be hyperosmotic compared to the tissue they're coming into contact with. This has been shown in some animal models and human studies, and may not be as much of a problem in some silicon-based lubricants.\n\n", "How long after quitting smoking to expel tar from lungs?": "\nIt is a misconception that you will start to cough up tar after smoking cessation. I can imagine why you would think that - after all, cigarettes contain tar and that has to have gone into your lungs, so it has to come out, right?\nWhat happens is that you breathe in fine particles with smoking, part of which your body gets rid of in the period after you had that cigarette. Another part settles in your lungs, but it's not going to get out. I'm guessing you're visualizing it as a collection of tar/dust in your lungs which you're going to cough out eventually if you keep coughing up enough. It simply isn't. You get mucus because of irritation/inflammation of the lungs due to smoking.\nWhat you are going to find is that your lung function gets better with time after smoking cessation. The amount of  mucus you cough up will likely also get less. This review gives some interesting background information about what smoking cessation does to your lungs and body.\n", "immune system - Can being cold or wet be a significant influence in getting the common cold?": "\nThis is a pretty old old-wives tale, taking many forms: don't go out into the cold while it's raining, or without a hat, with wet hair, without a warm coat or scarf, without boots, etc., \"or you'll catch your death of cold.\"\nThe old wive's tale was immortalized by Jane Austin in her book, Pride and Prejudice, when the heroine's sister Jane falls ill after getting a soaking in the rain.\nThis has been studied extensively. A New York Times article describes one such uncomfortable-sounding study:\n\nIn the 1950's, Chicago researchers repeated the experiment on a larger scale with several hundred volunteers sitting in their socks and underwear in a 60-degree room before being inoculated with infectious mucus. Others, in coats, hats and gloves, spent two hours in a large freezer. The conclusion: all 253 chilled volunteers caught cold at exactly the same rate as 175 members of a warm control group. \n\nIn other words, being cold had no effect on catching a cold.\nA 1968 experiment studied the effect of (among other methods of chilling) a cold water bath at several stages during and after inoculation with rhinovirus (one of the many viruses responsible for the common cold). No effect.\nYet the studies continue, because anything shown to decrease the incidence of the common cold would be beneficial to the sufferers, as in the US alone, 75 to 100 million physician visits are due to the common cold, and millions of days are lost from school and work.\nBut what has never been proven is that getting chilled in any way causes one to come down with a cold.\n'You'll Catch Your Death!'

E.g., in obstipated patients, other types of gut bacteria were found than in the control group, which still can't tell what is cause and what is effect. Stool transplantation is also an emerging therapy for various diseases (see also here and here), so while there is no better explanation for your question, I think the difference in composition of gut flora may be a good candidate to explain individual variation.\n", "dentistry - How does removal of calculus/tartar above the gum line affect deposits below gum line?": "\nI will answer to each element of your quesiton separatly:\nCalculus (Tarter) is calcified bio-film and plaque that is stuck on the surfaces of your teeth. Inside are bacterias, dead or alive, along with their byproducts (and their toxins) that irritate the gums, which may eventually cause an immune response in the gums that will lead to a recession.\nTherefore, scaling (removing) the \"half\" that is above the gums will do little or nothing to improve your situation, especially if there is anything left behind, bellow the gums.\nThe same can be said of any mouthrinces and other products you might try. They will hardly have any effect on the surfaces of the teeth above the gum line, due to the relatively short amount of time most people keep mouthrince in their mouth, the slow diffusion of the active ingredients across the calculus. It will not even reach below the gums wont remove/dissolve sub-gingival plaque or calculus. \nOn the other hand, if you chose to attempt to perform scaling deeper with picks, you risk damaging your gums, especially since the \"picks\" will be pointed towards your gums, and you will eventually slide them too far and therefore damage even more the soft tissues that surround and support your tooth, potentially accelerating the recession, or worsening the inflamation.\nDentists and hygienists use scalers and curettes, which cause minimal damage to the gums if used properly. Do not attempt to use them at home, on yourself, if you don't know what you are doing or lack good dexterity and technique. There are numerous videos on YouTube about how to use them.\nNeedless to say, if you have access to a hygienist, a dentist or periodontist (dentist that specializes in the treatment of gums) you will be in good hands.\n", "cardiology - Is it normal to feel your heart beat in your chest?": "\n\nIs it normal for a person to at times feel their heart beat in their chest without actually placing their hand on their chest, while at other times not be able to...? \n\nYes, this is normal.\nNormally, people do not feel their heart beating in their chest at rest. It is one of those things similar to breathing - it's happening, but we're not often aware of it (which is good as it might be very distracting otherwise.)\nHowever, an alteration in the steady background of the beating heart is often perceived. Sometimes the alteration is due to increased rate or force of contractions. If so, the sensation of feeling your heart beating (normally under the circumstances) is called physiological palpitations (i.e. normal.) If they are a result of an \"abnormal\" rate or rhythm, the phenomenon is known as \"palpitations\".\n\nIn normal resting conditions, the activity of the heart is generally not perceived by the individual. However, during or immediately after intense physical activity or emotional stress, it may be quite normal to become aware of one's own heartbeat for brief periods; these sensations are regarded as physiological palpitations, in that they represent the normal or expected response to a certain challenge or activity leading to an increase in the frequency and strength of the contraction of the heart. Outside of such situations, instead, palpitations are perceived as abnormal.2 \n\nThe sensory mechanisms responsible for palpitation are unknown.1 \nWhat we do know, though, is that if the heart beats faster or more forcefully, we do feel this, both in our chest, and in our necks, as exemplified in the expression, \"my heart rose into my throat.\" We have baroreceptors in major blood vessels in our neck; when more blood is pushed into our arteries by a forceful beat, there is an awareness of increased pressure.\n\nPalpitations are a symptom defined as awareness of the heartbeat and are described by patients as a disagreeable sensation of pulsation or movement in the chest and/or adjacent areas.2 \n\nA more forceful contraction means more blood is pumped in that heart cycle. This can happen if suddenly stressed (e.g. you're speeding and you see a police car pull into your lane behind you); the adrenaline increases both the rate and the force of your heartbeat.  \nLikewise, when you have a premature ventricular contraction, or PVC. The first beat is early; this allows the next cycle to have a longer \"filling time\", and the resultant more forceful contraction will be felt. Medically speaking:\n\nIn cases of isolated extrasystoles, the augmented post-extrasystolic beat may be felt in place of, or in addition to, the premature beat.\n\nIf you have an irregular heartbeat - the weaker ones will not be felt, but the more forceful ones will. This often is perceived as a fluttering in the chest.\nFinally, some people are just more sensitive to their heart beat. This also occurs in hypervigilant states.\n1 Palpitations\n2 Management of patients with palpitations: a position paper from the European Heart Rhythm Association \n", "clinical study - Are these studies about red algae reducing cold virus by 92% believable?": "\nOne might wonder why they gave an ambiguous and questionably relevant figure like \"reduces virus by 92%\" rather than saying \"people recovered more quickly\" or something like that. The answer is that in reference 1, which used real-world measures of cold severity and duration, the drug was a total failure. You can see this by looking on the results tab at the \"95% confidence interval.\" This is intended to represent a range of plausible values for the true effect of the drug, extrapolating from the sample of people that was studied (it gives a range of values because you can never know the exact value -- due to random chance, the people who were included in a study won't perfectly represent the entire population of people who might use the drug). By scientific convention, if the 95% confidence interval includes zero, the evidence isn't strong enough to say that the drug has an effect. \nThe study looked at several outcomes, including patients' ratings of their symptoms, their impression of whether the drug worked, and the duration of their cold. For the first four outcomes, the confidence interval includes zero. For #5, duration of the cold, they don't report that kind of confidence interval, but they report a p-value which tells you the same thing (if p>.05, then by convention the evidence is not strong enough). For #6 they used a test where the critical value for the confidence interval is 1 and not 0. \nIn other words, the clinical trial of this particular drug gives us little reason to believe that it works. That doesn't mean that it doesn't work, but they certainly haven't made a convincing case.\n", "What are the natural ways to increase the blood pressure?": "\nIf you're saying that you have a low blood pressure and you're seeking to reestablish a phisiological value I would answer you that low blood pressure it's not a disease unless it's really too low, but this is something you should clarify with your doctor.

Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)\nHow Is Hypotension Treated?\n", "cardiology - What do blood pressure readings indicate?": "\nI would like to add a brief answer in common language. The heart is a pump which pushes blood into the arteries in pulsatile manner (pushes out blood with each heart beat). As the blood is pushed in the arteries, the pressure rises to a peak called systolic pressure, which is usually around 120 mm Hg. As the heart's main chamber (left ventricle) relaxes, the pressure tends to fall. But fall in pressure is arrested by closure of a valve called aortic valve. Further fall in pressure occurs by flow of blood to peripheral tissues.  The lowest limit to which the pressure falls in main arteries is called diastolic pressure and it is usually around 80 mm Hg. \nMorever, when the blood pressure is checked with a mercury instrument, the cuff around arm is inflated to about 200 mm Hg (to occlude the flow in artery of the arm) and then slowly pressure is reduced while listening to the sounds over artery in front of the elbow joint. Knocking sounds start coming at systolic pressure (usually around 120 mm Hg). These sounds disappear as the cuff pressure is lowered below diastolic blood pressure (usually around 80 mm Hg). Hence, the BP reading is said to be 120/80.\nThe following figure from the Blood pressure Wikipedia page should make this clearer. The notch on the downnstroke indicates point of closure of the aortic valve.  \n\n\nEdit in response to comment below: The mechanism of these sounds is not entirely clear and has been subject of study since long (see this 1929 article: http://www.ahjonline.com/article/S0002-8703(29)90277-5/abstract . Many theories have been proposed e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2774311 . It is likely to originate from the artery wall due to vibrations created by turbulent flow that occurs when blood flow is partially obstructed (ref: https://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/physio/vlab/cardio/auscul.htm). There is no sound when the flow is totally obstructed i.e. cuff pressure greater than systolic pressure. Also, there is no sound when cuff pressure is lower than diastolic since the flow then is laminar and not turbulent. The nature of sounds (called Korotkoff sounds) also varies as pressure is lowered from systolic to diastolic and 5 phases have been identified: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korotkoff_sounds#The_five_Korotkoff_sounds\nReferences:\nCardiac Cycle\nHuman Physiology/The cardiovascular system\n", "Why are only arms used for measuring the blood pressure?": "\nBlood pressure is often checked in lower limbs also. BP needs to be checked in all limbs if one is suspecting obstruction in the arteries. Takayasu's arteritis and atherosclerosis are 2 conditions that can result in unequal blood pressure in different limbs due to obstruction of arteries. \nIn ankle-brachial index test, blood pressure is checked in the arm and at ankle to detect peripheral arterial disease (PAD: http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ankle-brachial-index/basics/definition/prc-20014625 )\nAlso, if coarctation of aorta (congenital narrowing of great artery in thorax) is supected, pressure in lower limbs will be lower than that in upper limbs.\nAortic regurgitation (incompetence of aortic valve) leads to higher pressure in lower limb than in upper limb due to pressure wave reflection. Here also it is recommended that pressure is recorded in both upper and lower limb. The degree of change in lower limb correlates with severity of regurgitation (Hill's sign).\nInitially, blood pressure should be recorded in both upper limbs. If BP difference in 2 arms is more than 15 mm Hg (systolic), tests (e.g. Doppler ultrasound) should be done to rule out obstruction. For following up on treatment of high blood pressure in such cases, higher blood pressure should be taken and controlled with medication. \nBlood pressure can also be estimated using finger probes, but their accuracy and reliability is not well established. This will also be subject to diseases of arteries in the arm, forearm and hand. \nFor checking blood pressure, one needs an area where the artery can be compressed and one needs to listen to the artery distal to this area as the pressure is released. Brachial artery lies in front part of elbow and can be heard over easily. On the other hand, the artery in knee lies posteriorly (behind the knee). \nSince arteries to upper limbs come out of aorta much earlier than arteries to lower limbs, the pressure in upper limbs would be much less subject to diseases of aorta or compression on it by masses in thorax or abdomen. This would be main reason to prefer arms over legs, in addition to simple convenience factor. \n", "hematology - Does a person's healthy hemoglobin level vary from country to country?": "\nTo be precise, one needs to know what \"normal\" means.\nNormal is actually a function of two measurements (for example, hemoglobin level and number of people sampled with said hemoglobin level). This generates a bell-shaped curve. \nThe graph of the normal distribution gives us both the mean and standard deviations from the mean. If the standard deviation is large, the curve is shorter and wider. If the standard deviation is small, the curve is taller and narrower. \nFor example, if one measured 500 American males at 30 years of age who were 5'10 inches tall, your curve would look something like this:\n\nwhere zero (the mean) might be 177 pounds. Including one standard deviation above and below the mean would represent ~68% of the population. Some will be thin, some will be heavy; they will fall outside this 68%.\nIf the same measurements were taken in Africa, for instance, where there is a difference in diet and body habitus, then the mean might be 134 pounds. \nSo, yes, it is possible to have different \"normals\" for different countries. However, that does not mean the same thing as \"healthy\" or \"optimum\".\nBy and large, human beings are human beings, and what is regarded as healthy for an average person in Europe should be the same for an average person in India. \nThere are exceptions, for example, sherpas in Nepal have a lower number of red blood cells compared to lowlanders who must accommodate themselves to lower oxygen in the highlands by making more red blood cells. This is a result of selection for a gene that regulates red blood cell production in the low oxygen of the highlands, with other compensatory mechanisms.\n", "What has hot shower to do with low blood pressure?": "\nWhen the body is exposed to hot temperatures, the normal response of the body is  dilation of the peripheral blood vessels so that the heat energy in the blood can be released into the external environment, increasing the rate at which the body cools down.\nThis dilatation also leads to decreased peripheral vascular resistance (blood pooling in the extremities, for instance), and thus a decrease in blood pressure.  Thus if one already suffers from low blood pressure, exposure to hot environments may temporarily exacerbate the problem.\nhttp://www.colorado.edu/eeb/courses/1230jbasey/abstracts%202007/17.htm\n", "How can I achieve long term activation of the lower back to improve my posture?": "\nFirst of all, there is a weak correlation between posture and pain.\nSecondly, working on long term activation may hurt (as in pain) your back. \nIf you find that a certain posture is good for you try to sets of time in which you are in that posture. \nRemmember: your best posture is your next posture. \n", "First aid for a rabies dog bite": "\n\nWound cleansing is especially important when bitten, as it has been shown to remarlably reduce the risk of infections from animal bites in general, and in some animal studies, the likelihood of rabies infection.\nThis treatment should be immediate: irrigate with water or diluted water povidone-iodine solution.\nYou should consult a doctor as soon as possible. Animal bites are, by themselves, potentially very serious puncture wounds, and have the potential for a number of other infections beyond simply rabies.\nPost-exposure vaccination - For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, post-exposure anti-rabies vaccination should always include administration of both passive antibody and vaccine.\nIn the United States, post-exposure prophylaxis consists of a regimen of one dose of immune globulin and four doses of rabies vaccine over a 14-day period. Rabies immune globulin and the first dose of rabies vaccine should be given by your health care provider as soon as possible after exposure. Additional doses or rabies vaccine should be given on days 3, 7, and 14 after the first vaccination. \n\n\nSources: \nCDC - Rabies: Medical Care\nCDC - Rabies: When should I seek medical attention\n", "What are the symptoms of rabies?": "\nAs with many viral diseases, the symptoms begin very similar to those for influenza, including weakness and discomfort, general malaise, fever and headache.\nThe acute period for rabies generally lasts from 2 to 10 days, and may involve itching or prickling at the site of the bite (notwithstanding the symptoms of having been bitten) and then progress to a number of serious neurological symptoms, including anxiety, confusion, agitation, delirium, hallucinations and insomnia.\nIt should be noted that once these clinical signs appear, the survival rate for the disease approaches 0.\n", "prevention - Is rabies contagious?": "\nYes, rabies is most definitely contagious.\nThe most common route of infection is from the bite of an infected animal, which introduces virus-laden saliva to the victim. It's also possible, though much less likely, to be exposed to infective saliva in the eyes, nose and mouth.\nThe CDC claims that a person-to-person transmission of the virus via bite is theoretically possible, but has not been documented:\n\n...bite and non-bite exposures inflicted by infected humans could theoretically transmit rabies, but no such cases have been documented. \n\nThere has however been person-to-person transmission of the virus through organ transplants, also documented here.\nIn terms of avoiding spreading the disease, the routes of transmission suggest several clear methods:\n\nAvoiding contact with wild animals, or domestic animals in rabies endemic areas showing signs of infection, such as hydrophobia or aggressive behavior.\nVaccinating animal populations to interrupt transmission of the virus within wildlife.\nPostexposure prophylaxis for people who have come in contact with a potentially infectious animal.\nScreening of organ donors for rabies.\n\n", "Chances of getting diabetes type 1?": "\nBeing diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (DM1) at the age of 54 is very rare. It's usually diagnosed in children or teenagers and used to even be called 'juvenile diabetes' because of that. The reason it's usually diagnosed this early is because it comes from the body's inability to produce insulin in the pancreas after the immune system has destroyed these cells. But it's not totally unheard of to be diagnosed late. (I'm just including this because the answer for type 2 diabetes would be different)\nInheritance\nDiabetes isn't inherited in any kind of simple pattern. You can't say \"if a parent has it, the child will have it with a 50% probability\" - or even that a child of two people with DM1 will have DM1 themselves.\nThe Joslin Diabetes Center has a few numbers:\n\n\nIf an immediate relative (parent, brother, sister, son or daughter) has type 1 diabetes, one's risk of developing type 1 diabetes is 10 to 20 times the risk of the general population\n\nThe risk for a child of a parent with type 1 diabetes is lower if it is the mother \u2014 rather than the father \u2014 who has diabetes\n\n\n\nSince you don't know whether your mother had it, your risk is even harder to judge.\nPrevention\nThere are risk factors other than genetics for DM1, but unfortunately generally, type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. There are a few trials about this, the one I could find about injecting children with insulin was unsuccessful.\nThe good news is that if you are worried about having diabetes, testing isn't very complicated and can be done regularly with no adverse effects.\n", "steroids - What are the long term health risks from repeated cortisone injections?": "\nI'll start off by highlighting a couple of more general studies:\n\nCole & Schumacher (2005): A general study of corticosteroids, this found that some corticosteroids may be free of side effects (specifically, intraarticular corticosteroids) for a series of short-term injections for a short amount of time (one injection every three months for two years). However, other corticosteroids can cause tissue atrophy, if used for long periods of time - even for periods as short as two years. That said, the authors believe that more general research is needed to draw definitive conclusions. A full pdf of the study is available here.\nRaynauld et al. (2003): This is a study on general intraarticular steroids, as applied to osteoarthritis, which also found that there were no effects from the injections. Over two years, minimal side effects were noted. This used the same intervals as in Cole & Schumacher: One injection every three months for about two years.\n\nThese studies did not specifically address the cortisone shots you're concerned with; instead, they dealt with the more broader class of drugs called corticosteroids. I find the results of these studies interesting, because there are a lot of websites out there that say the exact opposite: That a range of side effects are possible if used long-term, and may very well occur. I highlighted these studies in part to show that more research may well be needed, and that different drugs may work better for different people.\nThe CDC has a list of potential side effects from the use of corticosteroids. The potential short-term side effects are too many to list, but I'll cover the long-term ones:\n\nGrowth problems in children\nBrittle bones\nMuscle weakness (see the tissue atrophy mentioned in Cole & Schumacher)\nDiabetes\nEye issues\n\nHowever - and this is an enormous \"however\" - this appears to be focused mainly on doses taken orally, and perhaps daily. In other words, side effects might change based on the method of intake, although this might be only a minor difference. Additionally, these are the effects of using corticosteroids on a much more frequent basis than you would be having them - and even then, these effects are only possibilities.\nThese studies are the closest approximations I can combine to address your specific case. It seems that three-month intervals are the longest period of time that has been studied in any depth. In other words, your regimen seems to be a rare one - and a safer one.\nEvery cortisone shot has the potential for side effects. But the combined effect of these multiple shots would most likely be have been diluted substantially. Studies with intervals of three months brought no side effects (and the risks given by the CDC appear to be due to repeated, short-term doses), and so it seems highly unlikely that your case will be any severer.\n", "dentistry - How do I know if I'm flossing correctly?": "\nDental flossing, essentially is done to maintain periodontal health, in hard to reach areas. Areas which are not used to any \"friction\" so, they will react in a rather singular manner in comparison to our exposed gums, per say. Thus, providing you presently have good oral health i.e. you don't have gingivitis which causes bleeding of the gums amidst brushing. \nInitially, flossing will cause inflammation and minor bleeding however, if the bleeding is rather severe it could indicate a periodontal disease and require medical intervention. Gums, if they are \"virgins\" to interdental flossing scene, will be tender, and this is common amongst nearly all whom who haven't flossed. So, despite your concern, they will become more firm once the plaque has been plausibly removed. As your gums become less tender, they will hence become less sensitive and no longer bleed as you floss. \nAlbeit, if the bleeding still prevails after a period of a week, it would be advised to either, refresh your knowledge on how to floss, or pay a visit to your dentist. The latter could conclude that, you are incorrectly flossing e.g. too much pressure and rigor. \nIt's difficult to judge when you'll become apparent of the benefits since, the greatest improvements will initially happen beyond your eye's magnification. This study may cure your curiosity, though.  \n", "dentistry - How often should I use mouthwash?": "\nI think the comment made by Carpetsmoker is important in this context.\nSome may find surprising (at least I did) that actually fluoride toothpaste is not clearly superior to fluoride containing mouth rinses according to a Cochrane Review published in 2009. Unfortunately all reviews are about  children or adolescent patients.\nMark Gabriel wonders the intermittent use of mouth rinses. When one is planning of intermittent use it is only natural that mouth rinse is used alongside with regular brushing. Then were faced with the important aspect pointed out by Carpetsmoker. Of course one could use brushing and mouth rinse alternatively since they are equally effective preventing caries. I think one should use either one and not to alternate since usually the more complex routines one developed, more likely they fail.\nAs so, I think we should look at whether mouth rinses provide any additional benefit to brushing. Three most common active ingredients in mouth rinses are some form of alcohol, chlorhexidine and fluoride (Wikipedia).\nThe longer-term effects of any treatment should always be evaluated, especially in this case since the use is projected to last possible of life-time. Chlorhexidine containing mouth rinses may cause staining and affect oral flora. The are no specific guidelines how long to use chlorhexidine containing mouth rinses  but one sources discourages using it more than 3-4 weeks (1,3). \nThere are some health concerns also regarding the alcohol containing mouth rinses. Currently it is controversial whether alcohol containing mouth rinses predispose to cancer (1,2,3). In general the possible adverse effects of long-term use are quite poorly established. \nThere is a 2004 Cochrane review investigating the effects of combining mouth rinse to regular brushing (Free review).\n\nThe main outcome was caries increment measured by the change in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces (D(M)FS).\nFive authors investigated brushing+mouth rinse versus brushing. There is some benefit from the combination treatment but it is very minimal. The same conclusion was drawn in two reviews by American Dental Association: \"Based on his findings, the author said that mouthrinses made with CHX, essential oils, or CPC could help reduce plaque and gingivitis in people who brushed and flossed. He also said that using these rinses along with brushing and flossing reduced plaque and gingivitis more than brushing and flossing alone.\" (4).\nAfter a long commentary I still did not answer the question in the topic. But, to conclude, there may be some benefit combining mouth rinse and brushing. Intermittent use may be better if mouth rinse contains alcohol or chlorhexidine. I am fairly certain that current literature does not include explicit answer to the OP\u00b4s question.\n", "medications - How do anti-gas remedies work?": "\nI cannot speak of all possible gas medicines. But there is a class of them which is indeed low risk and over the counter. These are silicones, and they work in a purely mechanical way, not getting absorbed by the body. \nThese silicones are the same stuff which you get in hair conditioner. They are quite inert chemically, and all they do is to change the surface tension of the liquid it is dissolved in - it becomes slippery, and if gas is pumped into it, it cannot form a bubble. As a result, it does not foam. \nThe bacteria in your intestine presumably continue to produce gas, but it quickly passes to its now-slippery contents, instead of being trapped and expanding them like the head of a poured beer. It does not exert painful, rumbling pressure anymore, and exits the intestine in small, less noticeable portions instead of creating mini-explosions. \nFor a reference, you can see this patent describing the mechanism of action of simethicone tablets: http://www.google.com/patents/US5612054. \n", "dentistry - Root canal before trying to get pregnant": "\nThe anesthetics used for the root canal are not very long lasting. An example of the longer-acting local anesthetics is Bupivacaine. The average half-life of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride in adults is 2.7 hours (that is, within 2.7 hours, half of the total dose absorbed is metabolized. In people with liver  or renal failure, it may be longer, as it is metabolized by the liver.\nWhile various factors may increase or decrease the half-life of bupivacaine, it is exceedingly unlikely that there will be any bupivicaine left in her system a week from having a root canal, let alone a month.\nOf course, the exact drug(s) used by her dentist may differ.\nBupivacaine\n", "dit - Protin and Spirulina - Mdical Scincs Stack Exchang": "\nRecommendations for daily protein intake vary widely. Expressed as a proportion of the person's body mass, a general requirement is considered to be 0.8 g per day and kg of body mass, that would be 68 g for you. If you are physically active, this might be more. One study on strength athletes concluded on protein requirements of 1.76 g.kg-1.day-1 for strength athletes, against 0.89 g.kg-1.day-1 for sedentary subjects. On the other hand (according to this study for instance) endurance sport does not raise protein requirements significantly, so 1 g.kg-1.day-1 would be enough for endurance athletes. Also, since endurance sport raises general energy requirements, the protein requirements are actually easier to meet (in terms of percentage of proteins in energy intake).\n", "weight - Why my hands are thin and stomach has a lot of fat": "\nPeople tend to gain weight around the abdomen and hips because we generally have many more millions out fat cells in those areas and very few in the hands. It is possible to gain weight in your hands, but it is not possible to target weight gain in only your hands. Weight gain and weight loss happens systemically; that is, that your entire body gains and loses weight at the same time in proportion to the amount of fat cells in that part of your body. \nAs for the disproportionate amount of fat cells in your abdominal region compared to your hands, I'm afraid you are just built that way.\n", "Why is the percentage of daily value for sugar omitted on US Nutrition Facts labels?": "\nAccording to the FDA website, no daily reference value has been established for sugars because no recommendations have been made for the total amount of sugar to eat in a day. \nKeep in mind that the sugar values listed do not distinguish between naturally occurring and added sugars because it is not a chemically meaningful distinction. So unlike nutritional information about vitamins, proteins, fats, etc, there really is no level of \"recommended sugar\" that would make a good blanket statement for everyone. \nClaims that high consumption of added sugars harmful to your health is an extremely complicated subject. It's not that the sugar itself is inherently harmful due to any of its chemical properties, it's just that added sugar tends to be in products that have extremely high fat and high calorie content and are easy to consume in large quantities.\nSo saying to avoid foods high in added sugars is good general advice, but labeling products to indicate that you should consume {x} amount of sugar per day was not a piece of nutritional guidance the FDA was prepared to make in that labeling.\n", "dermatology - What is the way to get rid of the redness that appears on the skin immediately after threading the upper lips?": "\nI've actually had to look up this procedure first. From what I've read in this article the procedure itself seems sanitary.\nStill our skin surface contains bacteria. When the hair is removed, the bacteria can enter through the pilo-sebaceuous duct.\n\nImage source: http://www.aknicare.co.uk/science.php\nThis is why it would be good to disinfect the skin prior to the procedure. The choice of antiseptic will depend on your skin sensitivity. 70% ethanol is a very effective antiseptic, but if you have sensitive skin (and the area above the mouth is sensitive in its own right) then ethanol can cause irritation.\nAnother, somewhat milder antiseptic is boric acid, but if it is absorbed and has systemic effects it can be toxic. This is why its use in cosmetic products has been restricted in the UK. (Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference, 34th edition) This is why (if you chose to use it) it should be used on intact skin only. (An aside: The use in children under 3 years of age is now forbidden. This is because children have more permeable skin, and absorption is more likely than in adults.)\nYou can always ask your pharmacist or dermatologist to recommend you an antiseptic that would be good for you to use on this sensitive area.\nAfter the procedure you can use a bit of talc powder to lessen the irritation.\nFrom Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference:\n\nPurified talc is used in massage and as a dusting powder to allay irritation and prevent chafing. It is usually mixed with starch, to increase absorption of moisture, and zinc oxide. Talc used in dusting powders or as talc poudrage should be sterilised.\nInhalation of talc can cause respiratory irritation; prolonged exposure may produce pneumoconiosis.\n\nBecause the area is right under your nose, you should just be careful not to inhale talc when you apply it, and you can apply a thin layer (there is no need for a thick layer). The microbiological quality of talc powder is very important, so make sure to purchase a reliable brand.\n", "recreational drugs - How much alcohol intake is required to trigger withdrawal?": "\nI don't think that you will find a definitive answer on this, unfortunately. There are too many factors on an individual basis to make it a blanket kind of projection. The closest that I found for any kind of writeup that addresses it is this published article.\nThe pertinent part of that is this section here:\n\nHow Much Alcohol Must Be Ingested (and over what period) for a Person to Develop Alcohol Dependence and to Be at Risk for Alcohol Withdrawal?\nThere is no absolute relationship between pattern of alcohol use and the risks of physiologic dependence and withdrawal, which most likely reflects the significant number of variables, in addition to duration and quantity of alcohol use, that can contribute to dependence and withdrawal risk for a given individual. Some of these additional variables include age, medical comorbidities (such as hepatic dysfunction), concomitant medication use, and seizure threshold.\nIt has been easier to quantify the risk of benzodiazepine withdrawal, based on degree of benzodiazepine use (even though benzodiazepines act at the same receptor as does alcohol and are cross-reactive with it). For example, daily use of 20 mg of diazepam for 3 weeks or longer is believed to be sufficient to induce physiologic dependence.3 However, the shorter half-life of alcohol (1\u20132 hours) has made similar predictions elusive in the case of alcohol abuse. In general, any suspicion of daily alcohol use over several weeks or more, regardless of quantity, should raise concern over possible alcohol withdrawal.\n\nSo, while you can make some possible predictions, you may just have to look at the drinking history pattern and project from that, and make preparations for withdrawal symptoms to occur in cases of extended consumption, even if it the first time the patient has consumed in that manner.\nAs far as the preparations, there is this article which addresses the clinical features, assessment and management of AWS (Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome).\n", "nutrition - Can vegan or vegetarian diets have a positive effect on people with diabetes?": "\nThere are several investigations assessing this issue. In several clinical trials (1, 2) Dr. Barnard has prooved that a low-fat vegan diet can improve serum values of HbA1c and requirements for medication of patients affected by type 2 diabetes. The same studies found significant improvements in plasma lipids (LDL and total cholesterols), that show decrease of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, often a complication of diabetes and metabolic disorders.\nAdditionally, clinical trials show that vegan and vegetarian diets promote weight loss (3, 4, 5) and improved insulin sensitivity(4, 5) being these two important risk factors for type 2 diabetes (6).\nThe reasons of the effectiveness must be found in the fact -among others- that vegetarians and vegans eat less quantities of total fats, saturated fats and highers amounts of fiber and show lower BMI (7).\n", "nutrition - What are the natural and healthy ways to increase blood sugar?": "\nThere seems to be some misunderstanding here, so this is going to be a long answer. \nOur body is very, very good at regulating several physical and chemical parameters inside itself 1. he most well known is the temperature: it does not matter if the air temperature is -50 Celsius or +50 Celsius, it will do its best to keep you between 36.5 and 37 Celsius, and will mostly succeed at that, with amazing precision, unless you get exposed for a long time to temperatures which are either too hot or too cold for its capabilities to adapt.  \nThe system for regulating blood sugar is similarly complicated. The body is actively trying to keep the blood sugar at a level which it \"believes\" is best for it, and unless its regulation mechanism is badly broken, it's succeeding at that, at least in the long term. Short term upward spikes and downward spikes do happen in the healthy human, if you are either eating or using up sugar at a rate too quick for the body to compensate. \nThere is a theory that eating too much glucose and other simple sugars can break this regulation system. The reason: they cause upward spikes when they are eaten, because they can be transformed into blood sugar very quickly, quicker than the body can stabilize the level of blood sugar. The body then goes into \"alarm! too high blood sugar!\" mode, and mobilizes whatever it can to reduce the blood sugar before it causes problems. That overreaction gets the spike down soon, but the high hormone levels stay, such that you now get a downward spike in blood sugar. \nThe supporters of the \"this is unhealthy\" side of the debate (note that the matter is not yet settled in the scientific community, although I'm under the impression that it has been gaining ground lately) say that first, this creates hunger pangs (because when your blood sugar falls, one of the body's mechanisms to get it back up is to create the feeling of hunger, so you supply it with more food) and leads to overeating, and second, frequently straining the blood sugar regulation system will make it less effective over time, because it's overworked, and also because the body gets less sensitive to its signals. This leads to metabolic syndrome and later, diabetes type 2, such that the body can no longer keep the blood sugar at the level it wants it to be. \nThe gist of it is: The reason why table sugar is considered unhealthy is that eating it raises blood sugar. Consequently, any other food which raises the blood sugar is just as healthy/unhealthy as table sugar. \nNow you can say that your friend seems to need her blood sugar raised, so for her, eating a food which raises it is not unhealthy. This is indeed logical, but in that case, then sugar is not unhealthy for her either. If she wants to try to raise her blood sugar with food, then pure glucose is indeed the best she can do, followed closely by table sugar. \n\nThat being said, if I were her, I would not try messing with my blood sugar levels through food. Her sugar regulating system is either working well, or malfunctioning. If it is working well, then there is nothing she should be doing about it, despite it not fitting some norm. If it is malfunctioning, then she must have some serious underlying condition, and she should seek diagnosis and treatment for it instead of eating sugar (which is unlikely to help for timeframes over several minutes to an hour anyway). If she mistrusts her general physician's competence in that matter, she should visit an endocrinologist. If she has no symptoms from the low blood sugar and trusts him that there is no cause to worry, she should keep everything as it is, instead of trying to override her hormones by gorging on glucose, or any other food which raises the blood sugar level. \n There are two cases that I know of where she can have too low blood sugar measured besides this value being the right one for her or her having a hormonal disturbance/diabetes. First, if she exercises too much, or after too long a time without eating (or drinking sweetened drinks), she can cause a downward spike in an otherwise healthy body. It will go away soon by itself. Second, if she is on a ketogenic diet (only fat and proteins, no carbohydrates at all), her blood sugar will plummet permanently. The solution there is to go back to normal food - unless there is medical indication for the ketogenic diet, such as epilepsy, in which case a health professional should decide whether the side effects are worth continuing it. \n", "Is there a best time of the day to measure blood pressure?": "\nBlood pressure of a person varies throughout the day. This is attributed to numerous factors including stimuli from your sorroundings. As an innate tendency of the body. blood pressure is lower at night when you sleep, and is higher when you wake up in the morning. It continuously increases(roughly) as the day progresses. \nSo there is no one best time to measure your blood pressure. If what you are looking to do is to monitor your blood pressure, then it is important that you measure it at the same time everyday - at whatever time of the day it is. If what you are trying to get is an accurate measurement, then you are better of measuring it at two different times of the day(in the morning and in the evening) and taking an average, or measure it at two different times and report the readings along with the time of the day the measurement was taken. If you are on any medication to control your blood pressure, then you should measure your blood pressure once in the morning before taking any medications and once in the evening (assuming that you take medication in the morning). However, your doctor may specifically ask you to measure your blood pressure at a particular time of the day. That is because he is interested in that particular value for some reason. \nReferences : \n\nShort- and Long-Term Blood Pressure Variability\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension)\n\n", "nutrition - Is avocado leaf tea potentially harmful to humans?": "\nThat wikipedia page seems to blame the toxicity of some avacado parts to their content of persin. According to the page on persin:\n\nPersin is a fungicidal toxin present in the avocado. It is generally\n  harmless to humans, but when consumed by domestic animals in large\n  quantities it is dangerous.\n\nEven in the case of animals, wikipedia suggests that it is the Guatemalan variety which is responsible for the reports of poisoning, not the Mexican variety. This is corroborated by an article which explains that the concern over the toxicity of avacado leaves originated with a 1984 study at the University of California at Davis. This study found that the consumption of very large amounts of avacado leaves was toxic to goats. However, an author of the atudy (Dr. Arthur Craigmill) clarified that the leaves in question were those of the Guatemalan avacado (Persea american), and that the toxic effects were not observed when goats were fed Mexican avacado leaves (Persea dryminfolia).\n", "cancer - What does \"prognostic significance\" mean exactly?": "\nAlthough it would be helpful if we knew what sort of pathology report this was, I surmise that it is likely describing analysis of a biopsy or surgically removed tissue specimen from a breast cancer.\nIn breast cancer, it has long been known that some but not all tumors express hormone receptors, particularly estrogen and progesterone. Although the mechanism is complicated, the basic idea is that estrogen can bind to the cells in the tumor and make it grow faster. For this reason, people with tumors expressing the estrogen receptor are often treated with hormonal therapy that blocks that hormonal stimulation. In pre-menopausal women, this is usually tamoxifen or a related drug, which blocks the receptors directly. In post-menopausal women, a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole, etc.) that block estrogen production are used. The important piece to note is that only tumors that express estrogen receptors respond to this type of hormonal treatment.\nPartly because of the availability of these hormonal treatments, and perhaps partly due to the biology of the tumors themselves, breast cancer that expresses estrogen receptors tends to have a better prognosis than estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. Prognosis can refer to a variety of outcomes; in cancer studies it\u2019s usually either survival or cancer-free survival. Patients with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer tend to fare better than those with estrogen-receptor negative tumors. Another way of stating that is: the presence of the estrogen-receptor has a favorable prognostic significance.\nThe pathology report (if I\u2019ve got the context correct!) is saying that most (80%) of the cells in the specimen expressed the estrogen receptor. It then comments that this is known to be a favorable finding.\n", "nutrition - What is rock salt?

Gourmet salts contain less sodium than table salt so are\n  better for your health Gourmet salts contain approximately 100% sodium\n  chloride, just like your average table salt, meaning they will have\n  exactly the same effect on your blood pressure and health.\nMyth 2. Gourmet salts contain minerals essential for good health\n  Gourmet salts are not a good source of essential minerals, instead you\n  can get all the vitamins and minerals you need from a balanced diet\n  with plenty of fruit and vegetables.\nMyth 3. Gourmet salts taste better or stronger so you can use less\n  There is no evidence that people use less of any type of salt. If you\n  prefer the flavour of a particular type of salt, and really want to\n  use it, use less to help cut down on your salt intake. Some gourmet\n  salts also have a larger crystal size, these might not taste as salty\n  as finer grains so the danger is you could end up using even more!\n\n", "Natural testosterone booster intakes?": "\nOther than the post and the website you mentioned, here are a few more natural testosterone boosters, some of them being substances, and others being lifestyle changes or things-to-do:\n1) In this study, pomegranates were found to increase salivary testosterone levels by an average of 24% (though this was averaged over both men and women, in just men, the increase was ~22%).\n2) In this study, the Ashwagandha group, in conjunction with resistance training, was able to increase their testosterone by 96.2 ng/dl, compared to the placebo group, that was only able to increase their testosterone levels by 18 ng/dl.\n3) In this study, significant correlations were observed between dietary intake and testosterone levels. My interpretation from the correlations in this study was that, in general, higher protein intake and higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA's) result in lower testosterone levels, while more carbohydrates, higher monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA's) and saturated fatty acids (SFA's) result in higher testosterone levels.\n4) Coming to the more controversial one, in this study, whiffing the pheromone copulin, which is secreted by ovulating females, increased salivary testosterone levels by an average of about 30%, as seen in the graph). Copulins are available on amazon; however, I have been unable to find the exact concentration of copulins used in this study and the time of exposure of the subjects to them, so proceed with your own risk.\n5) The safer alternative to the above option, which depending on your circumstances, may or may not be available to you, is sexual intercourse. In this study, participants in a visit to the sex club experienced a 72% increase in testosterone levels. Even the observers experienced an 11% increase as well.\n6) In this study, a 56 hours fast was observed to increase testosterone levels by 180% in normal non-obese men but not by any percentage in obese men, sadly.\n7) In this study, men who chopped trees for one hour experienced a 48.6% rise in testosterone levels. I quote from the study: \"A comparison of these results to the relative change in testosterone during a competitive soccer tournament in the same population reveals larger relative changes in testosterone following resource production (tree chopping), compared to competition (soccer).\"\n8) In this study, ingestion of 3000 mg of Royal Jelly caused an increase in testosterone levels (log testosterone levels in the RJ group was +0.12 \u00b1 0.04 log ng/mL vs. -0.02 \u00b1 0.05 log ng/mL in the placebo group).\n", "nutrition - Are all sugars detrimental to health when consumed in the quantity of common processed foods?": "\nNo sugar is harmful in moderation. Eating too much sugar can be bad. There are several different types of sugar, though.\nFructose is metabolized differently to sugar and glucose, which some research suggests can be harmful in massive doses**, but when digested as part of your diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, it does not appear to cause problems (Fructose natural occurs in fruit, which is how it gets its name).\n", "What's the best body position for measuring the blood pressure?": "\nWhile trying to measure the blood pressure, the physician is most likely interested in measuring the pressure inside the left ventricle of the heart. So it is necessary that the Sphygmomanometer and the cuff should remain at the level of the heart. If it is above the level of heart, the reading is likely to be low, and if it is below the heart, the reading is likely to be high. Also, the blood pressure varies with the posture of the body in which the measurement is taken. So the blood pressure value that exists in most guidelines (for example JNC 8) is measured in the sitting position. Hence the value we are intenting to measure is the one with the patient is sitting position, back supported, legs uncrossed, and upper arm bared. The diastolic pressure is high in sitting position, and systolic pressure is high in supine position. Not supporting the back will increase diastolic pressure, while sitting cross legged increases systolic pressure. This is due to the inherent mechanisms in the human body to maintain perfusions to certain organs. The detailed biomechanics is beyond the scope of the present discussion though.\nReference : New AHA Recommendations for Blood Pressure Measurement\n", "micronutrients - Taking Supplements": "\nUnless you're doing something stupid like eating polar bear liver, hypervitaminosis A is the result of long-term overconsumption: taking one supplement in the morning and one in the evening is no more or less dangerous than taking both at once.\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, the level of vitamin A overconsumption that presents a long-term risk to a healthy adult depends on the form that the vitamin is consumed in.  For pre-formed vitamin A (retinoids), the upper level is about three times the RDA, while for vitamin-A precursors (carotenoids), there is no known toxic effect for overconsumption, though it may raise the lung cancer risk of smoking or working with asbestos.\n", "inhalation - Are there studies of detriments to using deodorants?": "\nI can't speak for Old Spice, but Lynx/Axe is basically just a solution of perfume in ethanol. The ethanol kills the skin bacteria that generate the malodour (though the population quickly recovers!) and the perfume just makes you smell nice.\nPure/concentrated ethanol will destroy cell membranes, which is how it kills skin bacteria, so it's more dangerous than its widespread use in drinks would suggest (though fortunately diluting ethanol with water greatly reduces the damage to cell membranes). The solvent in Axe is about 95% ethanol and this is concentrated enough to cause damage. There isn't very much ethanol in a typical few seconds of spray, but I suppose if you pointed the can up your nose and inhaled as you sprayed you might cause some real damage. I suspect the intense pain it causes would mean most people will do this only once!\nBut I would guess the most dangerous ingredient in the deodorant is the perfume. Perfumes are an unholy mixture of terpenes, alcohols, ketones and lots of other stuff, and many of these chemicals are irritating to skin. Handling flasks of pure perfume is done in a fume cupboard with gloves and protective eye wear. Getting any large amount of perfume onto a mucous membrane like the eyes, throat or lungs would cause irritation and pain. But again, the amount of perfume in a few seconds of spray is small and you'd have to work at it to do yourself any serious harm.\nI suspect the warnings not to breathe the spray are largely just being cautious and/or a way of being protected from being sued. Though in principle the contents of the spray can cause harm this would take exceptional circumstances, and even then the result is likely to be local irritation rather than any serious damage.\nLater:\nTo my considerable surprise I have found a safety data sheet for Axe deodorant online (note that this is a 55KB PDF). The sheet gives the formulation though it omits the perfume concentration. I would guess this is because the perfume concentration is below the level where it has to be disclosed. The section on toxicology states:\nSECTION XI.

Diseases they had no immunity to might also have played a role. \nThe synthesis of vitamin D is well understood and sources describing it can be found in many places so I'm not going to quote the entire process, but a good explanation can be found here under the heading \"PHOTOSYNTHESIS OF VITAMIN D\". In short, it's a passive process that occurs in the skin and is not regulated by the brain, eyes, or other organs. What determines the amount of vitamin D synthesized by the body? Solely the amount of UVB photons penetrating the skin and the person's age:\n\nAnything that either influences the number of solar UVB photons that penetrate the skin or alters the amount of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin influences the cutaneous production of vitamin D3. The amount of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the epidermis is relatively constant until later in life, when it begins to decline (17, 18). Ibid., \"FACTORS THAT ALTER THE CUTANEOUS PRODUCTION OF VITAMIN D3\"\n\nThere are no other factors mentioned in synthesis, and as you can see from the diagram here there is no involvement of the eyes or brain in vitamin D physiology at any point. Could there be an indirect involvement of the brain since it also controls the parathyroid glands? Yes, there could, but that wouldn't change the results of how we measure vitamin D levels.\nTherefore, an assertion that the eyes are involved in vitamin D deficiencies is purely speculative and the burden of providing evidence for it would be on the person making the assertion. I can find no evidence to support the notion. It's also a little odd considering that a huge number of people living in developed countries have been wearing sunglasses for many decades without ill effect. Why would we have not seen this effect long ago? Is it possible these indigenous peoples have unique genetic differences that altered their basic mammalian vitamin D physiology and somehow caused their eyes to be involved? Well, anything's possible, but that would be an astonishing finding and it also is purely speculative.\n", "dermatology - Do we produce Vitamin D in the shade?": "\nThe exact value depends on a lot of things - skin tone, the time of day, latitude,  how deep the shade is,... \nThe study Vitamin D effective ultraviolet wavelengths due to scattering in shade found that the UVB radiation at 280\u2013320 nanometers that is needed for vitamin D production dropped to levels at around 50% in a tree shade and under an umbrella. It was much less on a covered veranda - around 11% - and completely absent in a car with closed windows.\nLatitudinal Variations over Australia of the Solar UV-Radiation Exposures for Vitamin D3 in Shade Compared to Full Sun came to similar conclusions (emphasis mine):\n\nUsing shade for UVD3 exposures can reduce total UV-radiation exposure by 37% to 58% compared to full sun UVD3 exposures. This research indicates that an improved approach to optimize UV-radiation exposures for the production of vitamin D3 is to use diffuse UV radiation under shade in and around the middle of the day.\n\nSince exposure to these wavelengths is what drives vitamin D production, an approximate answer to your question is probably \"around 35 to 55%\". \n", "cognitive science - Can we erase problematic memories to aid recovery from depression?": "\nYes, I understand you. I have been fighting a depression myself for the past months, although it must have gone on longer than that, undiagnosed. I know how it feels, and understand how you just want it gone away. \nThe direct answer to your question is: Selective memory loss is impossible. There is no way to forget that past year. But there is a way to get over the depression without forgetting. \nThe insidious thing about depression is that it makes everything seem like an insurmountable problem, and makes you feel incapable of solving it. So of course, you want the problems gone away. But the way forward is not to change the events which happened, or erase your memory of them. It is to learn that they are not really as bad as they feel, even when your depressed mind is convinced that they are terrible. \nI know it might seem impossible to you to do so - after all, you are feeling in your bones that they are bad things. But clinical practice, and my own experience, shows that it is very possible. \"Seeing the world with different eyes\" is a skill which can be learned, just like you can learn to knit socks or play the piano. And there are many things you can do to learn it - reading books, talking to a specialist (therapist), observing and imitating those who have it, talking with others who are going through the same process, practicing your new skill, and having support from non-affected friends and family members who cheer your success without putting you into a pressure trap. \nOne of the tricky things about depression is that it saps our motivation to do anything, even the things which will heal us. It is very logical: why do something that is hopeless? The important thing here is to recognize that this hopelessness is not real, it is an illusion created by the illness. It's hard to get over it, because it feels absolutely real, but it is possible. If your ability to motivate yourself is so far down you cannot start with something as hard as cognitive therapy, you could start a medication course (st john's worth for milder cases, if you don't take any other medications, or go straight for synthetic antidepressants), which will give you the initial \"spark\" which will give you the energy to pack your problems at the root. \nYou will need a long time until you start feeling normal again, but believe me, it does work, even it is a hard, two-steps-forward-one-backward road. And even when the goal is still far away, the gradual progress is better than staying in place. \nThe result of it will be that you won't have forgotten what happened to you that last year. But the memories will just be memories, which will not make you feel like an anxious, hopeless failure, the way they do now. Right now, you experience them like a barrier blocking your way forwards in life, and want them gone. When you learn to manage the depression, they will be more like a chalk line on your way - you can step over it without it holding you back in any way. \n\nMany of the resources you need have to be found locally, but I can suggest a few books. I have read tons of them in my own healing process, but these are the ones I found most helpful. \n\n\"The mindful way through depression\" by Mark Williams. It is a straight depression self-help book, and the program outlined there is worth it. But even if you can't bring yourself to go through the program, just reading it will bring you valuable insights. \n\"Performing under pressure\" by Hendrie Weisinger and J. P. Pawliw-Fry. When you are depressed, your problems seem much more overwhelming, while the energy you have to deal with them goes down. Learning strategies to make the best out of your limited energy is very helpful, and can bring you into an important positive feedback loop - the more problems you solve, the less hopeless you feel. \n\"The gifts of imperfection\" by Brene Brown. Depression makes us feel flawed, like we have failed at being proper humans. There are schools of thought which support such conclusions, and this book exposes the errors of these ways of thinking. \n\"On being certain\" by Robert Burton. We grow up believing in, well, our beliefs. But a successful cognitive change requires us to recognize that some of our beliefs are wrong, no matter how right they feel. This book is probably not for everybody, and it does not address the problem of depression directly. But once you realize that there are cognitive illusions, just like there are optical illusions, it becomes much easier to understand how a cognitive behavioral therapy or a mindfulness training works, and to not dismiss it as mumbo jumbo from the start. \n\n\nGood luck with your journey. And don't forget: you don't have to be special, or a super hero, to get over your own depression. All you need is the knowledge how to do it (I listed the sources above) and the tenacity to not give up when it feels hopeless. \n", "dentistry - How to stop or even reverse cavities?": "\nI can speak from personal experience, and from experience working as a physical chemist peripherally associated with a group researching dental care.\nMy personal experience is that I have a few lesions that my various dentists over the last couple of decades have decided not to fill because they are not serious and not getting any worse. So a dentist will not necessarily reach for their drill at every opportunity.\nMy research experience is that at least in vitro enamel can remineralise, but you are talking about incremental improvements and nothing approaching total repair of a cavity. Any major cavity will not repair itself.\nIt is impossible for you to assess the damage to your teeth because you have neither the skills nor the equipment required. Your dentist has both, and you should respect their judgement. Your dentist should probably not have been impatient with your questions, but bear in mind that by questioning him you are implying he does not know what he is talking about and even the most saintly of dentists will get fed up with this eventually.\n", "dentistry - Do adult braces have a medical need beyond cosmetics?": "\nThere are certain types of malocclusion that are have been shown to adversely affect quality of oral health and quality of life, but these are far, far fewer than the number of people sporting braces, adult or adolescent. The need for braces in the average teen, therefore, is no greater than the average adult. If you think of braces for teens as a necessity, it is no less a necessity for adults, that is, appearance is probably the only significant result for both average teens and adults.\nHowever, increased longevity has led to the need to keep healthy teeth for longer periods. Teeth continue to shift throughout life. Missing teeth (today's older adults are more likely to have had dental extractions than younger adults) allow teeth to shift, resulting in malocclusion. Malocclusion in turn can result in frequent inadvertent oral mucosal injuries. This can be corrected with braces.\nMissing teeth also mean less occlusive surfaces (chewing surface area). Believe it or not, this poses a choking hazard, as well as decreases a person's ability to enjoy certain foods. Braces or other orthodontic devices may be needed to shift teeth into proper position for bridges to restore occlusive surfaces. Since people are living longer, it makes sense to invest in procedures that will help you to continue to eat well.\nRecent reviews of dental literature, however, are showing that the oral health benefits of orthodontic intervention in adults are more limited. Malocclusion seems not to have a role in susceptibility to dental caries (as was previously believed), periodontal disease, and temporomandibular joint disorder. Therefor the oral health benefits of orthodontic intervention are more limited than previously believed.\nFinally, there is some evidence that adult orthodontics can result in harm in the form of root shortening, which can lead to loose teeth.\nDeterminants of masticatory performance in dentate adults\nDental crowding as a caries risk factor: A systematic review\nCausal relation between malocclusion and caries \n", "vision - How does myopia actually work?": "\nThe image you gave is not clear because it does not show the fact that the divergence pattern of light from a close object is different from the divergence pattern of light from a distant object. \n\nLight rays from a close object (first image) diverge, and therefore they are in focus for the myopic eye.\nLight rays from a distant object (second image) is approximately parallel, and therefore they are not in focus for the myopic eye. The lens corrects for this inability to focus and allows the distant object to become in focus.\nAlso note that the myopic person is still capable of focusing on close objects despite the lens because the lenses are still capable of dynamic adjustment, but less so than a person with perfect eyesight. You can test this by focusing on a near object, then putting on your glasses. The object should be initially out of focus, and then become in focus as the eye lenses adjust to the distance. \nMyopia/presbyopia is fundamentally an issue of the focal range of the eye becoming limited to a specific range. If the ability of the eye lenses to dynamically adjust is further weakened, it may require progressive lenses or bifocals to correct the issue. \n", "brushing teeth - Are there any proven benefits of electric toothbrushes over manual toothbrushing?": "\nThere is some very good evidence that replacing a manual toothbrush with an electric toothbrush can help in reducing plaque and the risk of gingivitis. \nThe Cochrane Oral Health Group published a review1 that summarized over 50 studies from 1964-2011. A majority of the studies tested the effects of a rotating oscillating electric toothbrush against a manual toothbrush. Overall, they found a 21% reduction in plaque and an 11% reduction in gingivitis. \nThere are some things that weren't found by the studies that were reviewed, mainly what the long-term dental benefits of electric toothbrushes. Also, side effects were rarely reported, so there was no sufficient evidence of whether electric toothbrushes can be harmful to your teeth. \nA study done in 20082 tested oscillating powered toothbrushes against manual toothbrushes over a 9 month period. It started with a 3 week period of oral care. Then some people brushed twice daily with either an oscillating powered toothbrush, a manual toothbrush, and a manual toothbrush and flood together. The powered toothbrush was able to keep the levels of plaque lower than the other two groups and also help prevent gingival bleeding. Another 2010 study3 also found very similar results in which the oscillating toothbrush help reduce plaque and prevent gum bleeding. From these studies and many others, we can see that oscillating toothbrushes are better for your teeth than manual toothbrushes.\nThere is another type of electric toothbrush, sonic toothbrushes. They work by vibrating the brush head at sonic speeds. Though there are more studies done on oscillating toothbrushes, there have been a few done on the effectiveness of sonic toothbrushes. This 2015 study4 found that sonic toothbrushes were significantly better at reducing plaque than manual toothbrushes. An earlier study published in 20145 also found that sonic toothbrushes were more effective at plaque removal. They also found that for a short time (1 week), the sonic toothbrushes were better at reducing the risk of gingival inflammation. After 3 weeks though, the amount of papillary bleeding (bleeding in some parts of the mouth) were the same between those who used sonic toothbrushes and manual toothbrushes. Overall though, it seems that sonic toothbrushes are also better for your oral health than manual toothbrushes.\nSo we can see that both main types of electric toothbrushes are better than manual toothbrushes. But which is better, sonic toothbrushes or oscillating toothbrushes? In fact, a handful of studies has been done on this topic.\nA 2013 study6 tested the two types of powered toothbrushes. Both the sonic and the oscillating toothbrushes were able to significantly reduce plaque and risk of gingivitis, but the results showed the oscillating toothbrush performed better than the sonic toothbrush. Three 2014 studies7, 8, 9 agree with the conclusion that oscillating toothbrushes are better at reducing plaque and gingival bleeding than sonic toothbrushes. All of those studies were performed very similarly and had some of the same researchers between them. From these results, we can see that oscillating toothbrushes are superior to sonic toothbrushes.\nFor both electric toothbrushes, we can see that risk of gingivitis and the amount of plaque on the teeth are reduced. You did ask more thing which I will answer more directly.\n\nAre there really any long-term benefits associated with electric toothbrushes?\n\nWell, from the trials I've mentioned, we can see that this is most likely the case. The longest trial I directly mentioned2 was 9 months long and it showed that 9 months of consistently using an electric toothbrush did help reduce plaque and gingival bleeding. Manual toothbrush can keep your teeth clean, but it takes more work than an electric toothbrush.\nWhy doesn't everyone use an electric toothbrush if they are proven to be better?\nWell, there are a few things that come into play10. Even though electric toothbrushes are more effective at cleaning teeth and they don't take as much work as manual toothbrush, some people aren't willing to pay so much for a toothbrush. Some of the cheapest electric toothbrushes cost only $5, but the higher quality ones can go for over $100. You can get a five pack of manual toothbrushes for under $5. Another con of electric toothbrushes is that they are a hassle. They are bigger, and they require batteries or they have to be charged. Some people just don't want to deal with that. Lastly, electric toothbrushes can be easily broken. If you drop it, that might be it and you just lost $10. Now, electric toothbrushes are becoming more popular, but some of these cons are still holding people back.\n\n[1]  Powered/electric toothbrushes compared to manual toothbrushes for maintaining oral health\n[2]  PComparison of the use of different modes of mechanical oral hygiene in prevention of plaque and gingivitis\n[3]  Manual orthodontic vs. oscillating-rotating electric toothbrush in orthodontic patients: a randomised clinical trial\n[4]  Is a new sonic toothbrush more effective in plaque removal than a manual toothbrush?\n[5]  Toothbrush efficacy for plaque removal\n[6]  A 12-week clinical comparison of an oscillating-rotating power brush versus a marketed sonic brush with self-adjusting technology in reducing plaque and gingivitis\n[7]  A randomized clinical trial evaluating gingivitis and plaque reduction of an oscillating-rotating power brush with a new brush head with angled bristles versus a marketed sonic brush with self-adjusting technology\n[8]  A randomized 12-week clinical comparison of an oscillating-rotating toothbrush to a new sonic brush in the reduction of gingivitis and plaque\n[9]  A six-week clinical evaluation of the plaque and gingivitis efficacy of an oscillating-rotating power toothbrush with a novel brush head utilizing angled CrissCross bristles versus a sonic toothbrush\n[10]  Manual Toothbrush VS Electric Toothbrush: Pros and Cons\n", "diet - Question about contents of small bowel": "\nI think its still called Chyme:\n\nAfter hours of mechanical and chemical digestion, food has been\n  reduced into chyme.

What's the date today?\"): transient and generally resolves in a matter of 30-60 minutes after the procedure.\n\nECT is often associated with:\n\nloss of short-term memory during the period of time that you are having ECT treatments (e.g. \"Did I have lunch already?

Events of 2-6 weeks before treatment are the more sensitive. Some patients have \"spotty\" memory loss for events as far back as 6 months before beginning ECT. (\"I can remember Christmas with my family, but I can't remember what gifts I got.\" \"I remember going to New York, but I don't remember where I stayed.\" This memory impairment is potentially (not certainly) permanent. Rarely, patients have reported a more severe memory loss of events which date back further than the 6 months preceding ECT treatments.\n\nYou can't count on ECT for any memory loss, since the norm is to remember everything within a few months at most. Also, as mentioned in comments, there is no way to know which memories will be affected. You might remember every painful detail of the past year, and forget some of the more pleasant ones.\nElectroconvulsive therapy\n", "sleep - Sleeping position with Hepatitis A": "\nI might hazard a guess that \"don't put pressure on your liver\" means don't take medications that might tax the liver, or drink alcohol, etc. I don't think they meant \"don't squeeze the liver.\"\nHowever, if they did mean that, it would be my recommendation that she sleep in the left lateral decubitus position.\n\nSince the liver is on the right side, lying on her left side with the head of the bed slightly elevated will exert the least amount of pressure on the liver.

If there is an injury, the area around it gets inflamed, and these will lead to spasm of the muscles.

There are still a lot of studies being conducted and many of the answers aren't in. \nA bit of background. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV - the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis) is a member of the herpesvirus family, very \"successful\" viruses in that most of the world's population are infected (90% of the world's population has been infected with EBV), and the viruses are known to remain in the host's body throughout their lifetimes (that is, the host doesn't usually die from the disease, instead living to pass it on to others). With Herpes Simplex, reactivation is in the form of cold sores. With varicella-zoster virus - the cause of chickenpox - reactivation takes the form of \"shingles\". So, to expect EBV of periodic reactivation isn't very far fetched.\nIn the US, ~50% of the population seroconverts (becomes infected as manifested by antibodies to the virus) before 5 years of age. This population has not been extensively studied for asymptomatic viral shedding. In the rest of the population, most cases of EBV infection are still subclinical, but some adolescents and young adults - about 25% of those newly infected - get the illness known as infectious mononucleosis (IM). This has been the group most studied group in terms of who is shedding virus and who isn't.\nOnce infected, humans carry the virus for life in a small number of white blood cells called \"memory B lymphocytes\". Immediately following infection, the cells shedding the most virus are pharyngeal epithelial cells (though this has been challenged), so virus is present in the saliva, but has also been found in other bodily fluids.\n\nOne study in France followed 30 patients for 6 months: 20 after diagnosis of IM, and 10 healthy EBV carriers (determined by the presence of IgG antibodies against EBV and the absence of IgM) as controls. Blood and  saliva samples were collected at day 0 [D0]), D3, D7, D15, D30, D60, D90, and D180 on all subjects.\nInfectivity of saliva was determined by lymphocyte transformation in cell cultures of fresh cord-blood lymphocytes.\nAll newly infected patients had sustained viral shedding in the saliva, and all still had infectious saliva at day 180, 16 patients maintaining a high EBV load during the 6 months of follow-up, and 4 showing a low level of virus, though viral load was significantly lower at D180 than at D90 in all patients. Of the controls (healthy people who had positive antibodies), 8 subjects had 2\u20134 episodes of detectable EBV in their saliva, with the remaining 2 having no EBV in their saliva during the follow-up period. \nIn the patient blood samples, EBV-infected B cells decreased significantly from day 0 to day 180, with 18 showing a viral rebound between D30 and D90. Among these 18, 4 patients had tonsillitis and lymphadenopathy (!) which indicates a recurrence. Only one of the control subjects showed no detectable  EBV in their Memory B Cells during the entire follow-up period. This shows that patients with IM remain highly infectious during convalescence.\nA Japanese study analyzed the prevalence of EBV in saliva and throat washings from healthy people. EBV DNA was detected in 43 of 48 throat washings from healthy adults aged 21 to 57 years of age, and in 35 of 93 salivas from healthy children 0 to 6 years old. Umbilical cord lymphocytes were transformed by some throat washings from EBV seropositive donors, indicating infectivity of the virus. Furthermore, EBV DNA was detected in throat washings from 2 healthy adults whose EBV antibody was not detected. \nIn a study of 22 healthy EBV-seropositive blood donors over a period of 15 months, serology suggested reactivation (significant changes in viral load plus a serological response) in eight donors. Another five individuals also exhibited significant changes in viral load but no serologic response. Of the 13 volunteers with significant increases in viral load, 6 had a period of viremia accompanying the rise in viral load, that is, they had a viral infection clinically. \nWhat triggers reactivation in healthy subjects is not known precisely. The presumption is that it occurs when latently infected B cells respond to unrelated infections, because B-cell receptor stimulation triggers reactivation in B-cell lines. \nSo, whatever you have read, there is probably proof for it, as well as much else that wasn't read! It appears that healthy adults and children shed virus intermittently for an unknown number of years.\nImage from On the dynamics of acute EBV infection and the pathogenesis of infectious mononucleosis, Hadinoto et al, Blood. 2008 Feb 1; 111(3): 1420\u20131427.\nInfectious Mononucleosis\nProgress and Problems in Understanding and Managing Primary Epstein-Barr Virus Infections\nLong-Term Shedding of Infectious Epstein-Barr Virus after Infectious\nMononucleosis\nDetection of Epstein-Barr virus in salivas and throat washings in healthy adults and children\nMolecular Parameters for Precise Diagnosis of Asymptomatic Epstein-Barr Virus Reactivation in Healthy Carriers\nOn the dynamics of acute EBV infection and the pathogenesis of infectious mononucleosis\n", "nutrition - What evidence is there for and against Alternate Day Fasting?": "\nThere is one systematic review on this topic. This study was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, which is the most respected journal in their discipline. As so, I consider this study perhaps the most important publication on this topic. Main conclusion was that the literature is scarce with regard to intermittent fasting. Small studies have been published, and these studies have shown positive outcomes with intermittent fasting. It is evident that these findings must be replicated in a study population reaching 1000+ participants.\nSome sources claims that currently they are conducting the largest study in intermittent fasting in Sweden, lead by professor Kerstin Brismar. Apparently the preliminary results are encouraging. No published studies are yet available. Following pages (in Swedish) have some more information: svt.se & Karolinska Institutet. Prof Brismar is a well-known researcher in metabolism and has a great credibility in her field. I am looking forward to their results.\nThere are hardly any harms with intermittent fasting, I think. But I think it has a great pit fall. One must have strong spirit and psyche, since the human nature has a tendency to give \"rewards\". In this case it means that after two fasting days one should not eat more than is normal (+no candy etc.), since this would ruin the meaning of the diet.  \n", "pain - Prevent foot cramp from standing at workspace": "\nI think that shoes with good bridge support may be the answer here.\nI've been working wearing slippers (one of the many dangers of working at home!).\nMy guess is that whatever tendon runs the length of the sole was getting put under constant stress.\nI've now taken a fortnight away from standing, and I'm using my tennis trainers upon return.\nI think a better solution would be if I could find some mat made out of some kind of spongy material that allows the entire foot to sink into it, maybe at a slight angle so the heels are at a higher level than the toes, as I would guess the heel will sink further.\nHowever, I won't accept this (or any other) answer until I am certain my feet are back to a healthy state.\nEDIT: June 2016, A HogHeaven anti-fatigue mat has done the job perfectly.\n", "Does having more muscles influence blood pressure measurement?": "\nThere is evidence that a muscular arm will produce a higher systolic reading if the wrong sized cuff is applied.\nThere are two measurements in a blood pressure reading, the systolic and the diastolic. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the first number in a reading (Such as the 120 in 120/60), and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is the second number.\nThe method for taking an arm blood pressure is to wrap the cuff around the upper arm, place the stethoscope over the brachial artery, and inflate the cuff until you cannot hear any sounds. Slowly bleed the air out of the cuff, and note the number when the first sound appears, and when the sound disappears to get your reading.\nThe study I refer to above was performed at a Mexican bodybuilding competition. When a medium cuff was used, the SBP was significantly higher than with the larger cuff. Blood pressure overall was slightly lower with the correct sized cuff as well.\nSo while being muscular is not really a factor, clinicians should be aware of using the correct sized cuff to avoid artificially inflated blood pressure readings.\n", "pediatrics - Is it okay to make a child drink alcohol when they have a cold?": "\nThe right amount is none. Not at all. Don't do it. Don't even consider it.\nThere have been multiple studies on alcohol and brain development, quite a few of them on teens, as they are one of the higher risk groups. All of these show significant impacts on brain and social development. There are fewer on the young child (non infant) as they are not considered a risk group. More studies in that area look at the effect of the adults consumption around them.\nHowever, studies such as this one on postnatal rats show that even a single day of alcohol exposure is enough to affect brain weight and development in the postnatal period. This study also suggests that once the brain is formed, and going through differentiation (The process by which cells become specialized for their various functions) alcohol has a greater impact than when it is forming in utero.\nIn short, children should not be given alcohol for any reason. There are now warnings about such medications as cough syrups to not use them for any children under 4, as well as warnings about alcohol in formulas for older kids. I encourage you to read the labels, and choose non alcohol formulas if you do choose to administer cough syrup.\n", "side effects - Do the broken mercury thermometer causes any health problem or poisoning?": "\nThe mercury found in a thermometer is elemental mercury. It is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. However, the greatest problem with it is that, apart from ingestion, there can be another route of exposure without noticing. Elemental mercury easily evaporates on room temperature, and these vapours can be inhaled. In this form Hg is liposoluble and is readily absorbed and passes the blood-brain barrier easily. Since main toxic effects of any form of mercury are neuro-toxic ones, this is a major concern. \nThere is more information about toxicity of various forms of mercury in this Medscape article.\nAn EPA Toxicity and Exposure Assessment for Children's Health Report on elemental mercury states that:\n\nElevated levels of elemental mercury or mercury vapor in indoor air can occur as a result of accidental spills and can be lethal to children. Spills have occurred in home and school environments. Attempted clean-up using a vacuum cleaner disperses elemental mercury into the air, and is likely \n  to increase exposure.\n\nSo, yes: exposure to elemental mercury such as the one from a broken thermometer can cause poisoning. It can affect the nervous system, lungs, kidneys... \"Recovery is usually without sequela\" (without permanent consequences), but there have been cases with fatal outcomes. In pregnant women exposure has been associated with an increased rate of stillbirths. \n", "sex - How long will it take to show the signs of pregnancy after intercourse": "\nAssuming pregnancy takes place, the only reliable sign that a woman is pregnant is cessation of her menstrual period. If she's late, urine tests are a reliable way to confirm pregnancy, especially if the woman has irregular periods.\nUp to 50% of women will not experience nausea (the range, depending on the study, is 15-50%); while most will, when they do varies from early in the pregnancy (as early as 2 weeks after the first missed period, often peaking by the 9th week) to late (sometimes even into the early part of the second trimester). \nUrinary frequency is experienced in only about half of women in the first trimester (range 25-60%); Fatigue is subjective and depends on self-reporting; many women do not report fatigue in the first trimester, whereas nearly 100% do in the third trimester.\nEpidemiology of Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy: Prevalence, Severity, Determinants, and the Importance of Race/Ethnicity\nPrevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms during pregnancy in Taiwan\nDewhurst's Textbook of Obstetrics and Gynaecology\n", "eye - What are the different eyesight measures and how are they related to each other?": "\nFirst of all, one has to distinguish between visual acuity (VA), which is a measure for the maximal possible resolution your eye-brain-system can achieve, and the refractive error, which measures the deviation of the optical system of your eye from emmetropy (=perfectly balanced optics, sharp focus on retina without any glasses) in diopters of spheres and cylinders and thus determines what corrective glasses you need to wear in front of your eye in order to achieve your maximum possible visual acuity. \nVisual acuity can be measured without corrective glasses, i.e. the \"native\" VA of your eye, or with your best corrective glasses, which then gives you the value of your \"Best-corrected visual acuity\" (BCVA), and only this value is useful for comparison purposes, e.g. for driver's licenses (because errors that can be corrected by glasses also are to be corrected by law, as this is rather easy to do for everybody), and also for scientific evaluation of eye performance.\nThis also explains a common misconception: When somebody is very near- or farsighted (myope or hyperope), he has to wear glasses with a high (absolute) value of diopters, e.g. -7 dpt. But if he reaches 20/20 vision with his glasses on (again, BCVA), then to an eye doctor, this will matter the most; for the glasses are neglegible in comparison to \"real\" eye diseases which can impair your eye function and lower the BCVA your eye can reach. Many people incorrectly compare their eye functions by comparing the amount of diopters in their glasses, yet this doesn't really say anything about the maximum resolution their eyes have when wearing their best glasses. Refractive errors can be corrected by glasses, contact lenses and laser surgery, but the maximum visual acuity an eye-brain-system is able to achieve can not be altered in any (simple) way.\nNow, when visual acuity is measured, a full visual acuity, i.e. \"normal\", or 100%, or any way you'd like to name it, has once simply deliberately been determined by a minimum angle of resolution of 1 arc minute, and the charts that are used for testing it have letters that correspond with this resolution. 1 arc minute of resolution corresponds to being able to separate two points with 2,91 cm between them at a distance of 100 m. Now note that this does not necessarily correspond with what most people are able to see; as said previously, the definition of 100% visual acuity was deliberate.\nThe capability to distinguish points with 1 arc minute of space between them has been defined as 20/20 (or 6/6) vision in Snellen charts, 1.0 vision in decimal charts (conversion table), and later 0.0 logMAR, which is the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution and which has become the gold standard in measuring and comparing visual acuity (see p.13 for conversion chart), but is predominantly used for scientific purposes and less in clinical environments. \nThis is basic knowledge in optics, optometry and ophthalmology. Wikipedia describes the correlations between the terms pretty well.\n", "exercise - Push-ups at the office, more often or more at once?": "\nGo to one-handed desk pushups. Spread your legs a little more and leave the supporting hand off-centre: you will get a more intense workout, building strength in the arms and adding some additional core muscles.\nIf you can do 25 with two hands you can probably do 5 with one - if needed, start against the wall and go lower as you build additional strength.\n", "nutrition - Is eating a meal with 2000 Calories at once any different from eating 4 times at 500 Calories?": "\nThere have been quite a few studies on the influence of meal frequency, but usually they focus on weight loss.\nI could find one pilot study comparing people receiving either one or three meals a day, for a total of 8 weeks, while receiving the same amount of calories in total. All study subjects maintained their body weight. The study concluded:\n\nThere were no significant effects of meal frequency on heart rate, body temperature, or most of the blood variables measured. However, when consuming 1 meal/d, subjects had a significant increase in hunger; a significant modification of body composition, including reductions in fat mass; significant increases in blood pressure and in total, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol concentrations; and a significant decrease in concentrations of cortisol\n\nA controlled trial of reduced meal frequency without caloric restriction in healthy, normal-weight, middle-aged adults\nNote, however, that over a quarter of study subjects withdrew during the study. The authors report that it was for unrelated reasons, but such a high drop out rate is still a cause for concern. A concern you voice in your question is hunger, and when eating only one meal a day, that was something the study subjects reported significantly more than when eating three meals a day. \nAs I said, most studies focus on weight loss,and most have few study subjects. A recent meta-analysis (analyzing the existent literature on the topic) found \n\nThree randomized controlled clinical trials of fasting in humans were identified, and the results were published in 5 articles, all of which evaluated the effects of fasting on surrogate outcomes. Improvements in weight and other risk-related outcomes were found in the 3 trials. Two observational clinical outcomes studies in humans were found in which fasting was associated with a lower prevalence of CAD or diabetes diagnosis. No randomized controlled trials of fasting for clinical outcomes were identified\n\nBut ultimatively concluded:\n\nWhereas the few randomized controlled trials and observational clinical outcomes studies support the existence of a health benefit from fasting, substantial further research in humans is needed before the use of fasting as a health intervention can be recommended.\n\nHealth effects of intermittent fasting: hormesis or harm? A systematic review\nIntermittent fasting isn't exactly like what you are describing, but it comes close, and there's more studies on it than eating just one meal a day, which I suppose many people find unsustainable. \nAs an example for what I mean when I say studies are usually small, one that I saw cited a lot is: Intermittent fasting does not affect whole-body glucose, lipid, or protein metabolism. That study bases its conclusion, that Intermittent Fasting doesn't affect insulin sensitivity and various other factors on a study in just 8 healthy, lean males. \nOverall, I don't think there's a recommendation based on evidence that can be given - no frequency of meals that we can point to and say \"this is the optimal frequency for being healthy\". Or, at the very least, there isn't one yet (personally, I doubt there ever will be). No meal frequency seems to be associated with dramatic negative effects on health, and some may be associated with small beneficial changes. As it is, any meal frequency that person finds sustainable and satisfying is probably good. \n", "nutrition - What are the health risks of consuming 6-8 liters (1.5-2 gallons) of water daily?": "\nSummary \nThe primary risk of excessive water intake is hyponatremia (low sodium level in the blood). While a healthy person who drinks 6-8 liters of water daily is unlikely to suffer significant hyponatremia, people who drink this much often have psychiatric illness that is accompanied by poorly understood hormonal changes that may indeed cause hyponatremia and its attendant symptoms.\nPsychogenic polydipsia \nMany patients with a variety of psychiatric disorders drink more water than normal. This is termed psychogenic polydipsia. The cause is unknown.1 \nHyponatremia: mechanism \nSodium levels correlate closely with serum osmolality, since sodium is the primary cation contributing to osmotic pressure. The body maintains serum osmolality within a narrow range via regulation of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, a.k.a. arginine vasopressin), a hormone that is secreted by the posterior pituitary gland (a.k.a. neurohypophysis) at the base of the brain in response to a rise in serum osmolality. The hormone circulates in the blood and acts in the kidneys to increase free water resorption, thereby lowering serum osmolality. In the case of excess free water, ADH secretion will be maximally suppressed. \nIn a healthy person, ADH suppression results in urine diluted to a concentration of about 60 mmol/kg,4 which (assuming a normal glomerular filtration rate) corresponds to a fluid intake of about 28 L per day. Only above that level with serum osmolality be significantly compromised.\nSIADH \nUnfortunately, many people can not suppress ADH maximally. As a result, urine may be \u2018inappropriately\u2019 compromised in the face of falling serum osmolality. This is called, creatively, Syndrome of Inappropriate Diuretic Hormone (SIADH). For reasons that are incompletely understood, many psychiatric patients with psychogenic polydipsia (see below) have SIADH.3 Some of the reasons that are understood: \n\nMedications including antidepressants (primarily SSRIs) and antipsychotics are well-established causes of SIADH.  \nSchizophrenia itself appears to be associated with SIADH. \nChronic hyponatremia may lead to a \u2018reset osmostat\u2019 whereby the pituitary's threshold for ADH secretion is changed. \n\nHyponatremia: consequences\nThe constellation of symptoms associated with hyponatremia is termed hyponatremic encephalopathy.3 It includes: headache, blurred vision, weakness, muscle tremor and cramps, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, restlessness, confusion. This can progress, in severe cases, to seizures, coma, and death. It would be exceedingly rare for a person with purely psychogenic polydipsia to progress to this point (in part because one is likely to develop depressed consciousness and stop drinking such that the kidney can fix the problem prior to dying). \nOne important point is that the level of hyponatremia required to cause these symptoms is largely dependent on the rapidity of change. Acute hyponatremia can cause symptoms at a level of 128-130 mEQ/L (normal 135-145 mEq/L). On the other hand, patients with chronic SIADH may walk around with sodium 120-125 mEq/L without symptoms. \n\n\nReferences\n\n\n1. M Biswas and J S Davies.

The first thing a woman should do is see a physician to determine which kind of dysmenorrhea she has. \nPrimary dysmenorrhea is painful menstruation with a normal pelvic examination (no causes can be determined). It is is by far the most common gynecologic problem in menstruating women, can be worse in younger women than older ones, and is worse in smokers. Usually women refer to this kind of pain as \"menstrual cramps\", and they tend to occur just before and in the early part of menstruation. The cause is increased production of endometrial prostaglandins, natural hormones which cause uterine contractions. If the pain is severe enough, or in any way atypical, an pelvic ultrasound will be done to rule out pelvic pathology.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS) are the usual treatment because they are anti-prostaglandins; NSAIDS include ibuprofen, naproxin, aspirin, etc. If NSAIDS alone do not decrease pain sufficiently, patients are often placed on oral contraceptive pills, which will make periods lighter and less painful, or continuous-use OCP's that result in suppression of menses altogether. If these are inadequate in the absence of pelvic pathology, stronger medications can be prescribed, or one can try accupuncture. Topical heat is often comforting.\nSecondary dysmenorrhea is pain in the presence of gynecologic findings, usually endometriosis or adenomyosis (growth of endometrial tissue outside of the endometrial cavity, either outside of the uterus or in uterine muscle walls), adhesions, fibroid (benign) tumors, infection, or other problems. It tends to be more severe pain, later during the period, starts years after the onset of menses, can be associated with heavy menstrual flow or irregular cycles, or other. It's important to have a physician involved in the care of secondary dysmenorrhea. \n\nAspirin and NSAIDS  - A very nice overview of NSAIDs\nPrimary Dysmenorrhea\nAspirin and NSAIDS  - A very nice overview of NSAIDs\nTrials of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) units, laparoscopic presacral neuronectomy, acupuncture, omega-3 fatty acids, transdermal nitroglycerin, thiamine and magnesium all demonstrated some relief of dysmenorrhea symptoms. \n", "urology - Primary bladder neck obstruction treatment or cure": "\nUnfortunately, there is not much that can be done other than what you have mentioned. \nThe present guidelines for the management would include watchful waiting, medical (alpha blockers) or surgical (trans urethral bladder neck incision or resection). However, the present literature lack significant amount of randomized controlled trials that would provide reliable evidence regarding the efficacy of these treatment options. Existing reports provide contradicting results as well. Even though there are success stories of complete cure by the trans urethral bladder neck resection, this still remains to be a topic where further exploration needs to be done regarding the natural history of the disease, and possible treatment modalities. \nReferences : Primary Bladder Neck Obstruction in Men and Women\n", "Why does your head get enough blood and your feet don't when lifted above your body?": "\nThis is a very good question. The answer: because your head was meant to be above your body!\nYour body has very specific mechanisms for maintaining a constant blood flow in the cerebral circulation despite shifts in blood pressure, either due to changing blood pressure in the rest of the circulation or due to a different 'local' pressure because of position . This is termed autoregulation.\nThe blood pressure that the brain 'sees' is called 'cerebral perfusion pressure' (CPP). Technically CPP is the difference between intra-arterial pressure and the pressure in the veins, but venous pressure is very low (2-5 mm Hg), so we can estimate it as the arterial blood pressure (here, a weighted average of systolic and diastolic pressures). In a normal person accustomed to normal blood pressures, the body can maintain a constant blood flow of ~50 mL per 100 g of brain tissue per minute with a CPP range of ~60 to 160 mmHg. That\u2019s a big range!\nThe mechanisms of autoregulation are incompletely understood. Most likely reductions in CPP stimulate the release of substances that cause vasodilation (candidates include H+, K+, O2, adenosine), thereby increasing flow. On the other side, high pressures stimulate constriction of the myocites in cerebral vessels, reducing flow. \nThe end result is that your brain \u2018sees\u2019 a relatively constant pressure regardless of what position you\u2019re in or other factors that may change blood pressure. That having been said, if blood pressure fluctuates outside the range for which auto regulation can accommodate, position does indeed matter for blood pressure. If a patient is markedly hypotensive, for instance, it is traditional to tilt the bed so that their head is below their body.1 At the extremes, this manipulation can indeed affect blood flow to the brain.  \n\n\n1. This is termed the Trendelenberg position, although recent evidence indicates that this is not a good idea for hypotensive shock due to more complex cardiovascular considerations.\n \n\nAll of this material is summarized nicely in this publicly available textbook: Cipolla MJ. The Cerebral Circulation. San Rafael (CA): Morgan & Claypool Life Sciences; 2009. Chapter 5, Control of Cerebral Blood Flow.\n \n", "nutrition - Does it become harder to lose weight as you age?": "\nIn general, it is the basal metabolic rate (BMR) of the organism which in a person who doesn't exercise more than average, consumes most of the calories of the daily intake. It is dependent of age, sex, population and fat-free mass, i.e. the mass of muscles in your body, which consume a lot of energy just for maintenance. Studies show that it can vary individually between 1000 and 2500 kcal/day within just one population. Many factors and energy consumers contribute to the basal metabolic rate, but approximately 70% of it is used for maintenance of the body's main organs, and the rest is used for physical activity (in an average human) and for thermogenesis and digesting your food.\nIt is not known why exactly the BMR decreases with age. While it can be partly attributed to lifestyle changes after early adulthood with decrease in exercise and physical activity, studies show that it is not the only contributing factor. Part of it may be attributed to \"an alteration in tissue energy\". But when you compare age 40 with age 20, another part is that human adolescence and body growth are active until approximately age 17.5 in women and age 19 in men, which also heavily contributes to BMR.\nSo, the decrease in BMR with age is multifactorial, and thus may also be influenced in many ways, the most popular one being the increase of physical activity and thus fat-free mass, which is a big contributor to it as we learned here and here.\n", "nicotine - Natural ways to quit smoking": "\nNatural Ways to quit Smoking\n\nCandy and Gum.

Is it normal?": "\nWell unfortunately, without a lot more detail on the changes you've made to your diet and how you go about your exercise, it is impossible to exactly pin-point where the problem is, but here are some facts and pointers to help you out.\nThere are three main factors here:\n\nHormone levels\nDiet changes\nHow you exercise\n\nHormone Levels\nNormally, training alone doesn't cause significant increases in testosterone for there to be an effect on skin / acne, but if you are taking any supplements for this (like testosterone boosters), or happen to be going through puberty, then you may want to look into this with a doctor / dermatologist. \nDiet Changes\nThere are a lot of foods that you may have implemented in your new diet that can be causing acne. Dairy, for example, has had plenty of studies going back and forth as to the effects it has on acne, with a nice amount claiming certain amounts of dairy can cause it. \nFor more information on dietary causes, please read this article full of information and advice. It will help you spot any new foods you may have introduced into your diet.\nHow you Exercise\nJust like the dairy studies, plenty of people have gone back and forth with studies and evidence on sweating clogging up your pores. \nThe main principle behind this is that as you sweat, the sweat brings dirt and oils from the surface of your skin into your pores for them to get clogged. \nThis article gives more information on how sweat affects acne.\nAnd from personal experience, sweating caused me to develop some acne when I started training, so if this is the cause of your acne, you need to look at a few things:\n\nHow soon after your exercise do you shower? Leaving the sweat on your face for a prolonged amount of time isn't recommended, and you should wash your face as soon as you finish. On the counter-side of this, do not wash your face too often, as dry skin can also give you skin issues / acne. \nWhile exercising, make sure you are using a clean towel free of dirt to dry your face. Do not reuse towels before washing them between workouts. The dirt and oil left on a towel can be detrimental in preventing acne developing when you sweat. \nWhen showering, try using an exfoliating face wash that will assist you in properly deep cleaning your pores after a workout. Any product you use should be tested first, and used sparingly. \n\nFor more info on face washing, please check out this page for good tips on how to, and also for further tips on products.\nSo in Conclusion: \nYour acne can be caused by a plethora of changes you can be making to your body through hormones, diet, and exercise. But pinpointing the issue from the tips above and reading the cited material will help you make the changes needed to prevent it and finding the cause. \n", "benefits - Sex as a generic medical treatment modality?": "\nUnquestionably, sexual activity has several benefits for the body and mind. \nPeople who have a satisfactory sexual life tend to be happier, friendlier, calmer and sleep better. People who are happier, friendlier, calmer and sleep better, tend to need fewer medical appointments. Then again, sex is a touchy subject.  Unless you are a psychyatrist, most medical professionals would find it very difficult to find out if an individual patient has a regular and normal sexual life, and even more difficult if they are as pleasurable as they should be.  Trying to find out may induce some patients to lie. Worse than that, some may say the doctor is too nosy and never return.  \nEven if an occasionally uninhibited and outspoken patient says that they have no sexual activity and think they would be much happier if they did, to advise \"go and have sex to improve your general health or to help treat these disorders\" can be risky.  If the patient makes wrong choices and unexpected problems are created, malpractice actions may follow. \nAll a doctor can do is mention that pleasurable sexual activity is good for one's health. So are a good night's sleep and healthy meals, everybody knows that. I'm sure those who enjoy sex, and know where to get a good partner, will have it whenever they want.  For those who cannot find a partner or who do not enjoy sex at all, it's no use telling them to go and have it for the sake of their health. They simply won't.\nps - Even if a medical professional were sure some sort of sexual therapy would be of great benefit to an individual patient, any sort of prescription would have to be approved by the FDA or an official Secretary of Health.\n", "dermatology - Is UV light necessary for vitamin D generation?": "\nShort answer: No.\nLonger answer: UVB rays are essential for Vitamin D synthesis. According to some studies, 1 hour of sunshine is needed even in sunny climates - but only in average, still depending on latitude, skin color and other factors - to prevent Vitamin D deficiency. Still, even the average sun exposure in mid-latitude regions summers might not fulfill your body's needs for UV radation to supply itself with Vitamin D, but opinions on this differ (as can be seen in comparison with the first link of this paragraph). \nBut when comparing it to 1 hour of full sun exposure in mild climates, it is safe to conclude that the UVB levels behind glass windows, as measured in the first overall link above, are so low that it is highly improbable to reach sufficient Vitamin D levels behind them.\n", "lifestyle - Effects of commuting on health": "\nWhen studied from a physiological point of view, commuting is generally divided into two categories: active and non-active. The former involves modes of transportation such as walking and bicycling, where the commuter is actively getting exercise. The latter involves modes of transportation such as cars, buses, and trains, where the commuter is getting virtually no exercise.\nMany studies compare modes of transportation that fall into different categories; I chose to put them into one or the other based on which mode was focused on more. Other studies focused solely on one type of commuting. If you want to skip the specifics, you can go all the way to the bottom.\nStudies on active commuting\n\nHammer & Chida (2008): Commuting involving walking and bicycling corresponded to a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular diseases by approximately 11%. The effect was, for unknown reasons, more pronounced among women than among men.\nRojas-Rueda et al. (2011): Bicyclists using a bicycle-sharing program avoided ~12.28 deaths in Barcelona over the course of one year. Some of this came from a reduction in road accidents, while other parts of it came from a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, which reduces air quality in urban areas for commuters.\nDavison et al. (2008): Children who walk and bicycle to school have, on average, better health than children who take buses or cars to school. Active transport burned 33.2-44.2 kcal per day, assuming a mean travel time for these children at about twenty minutes. Boys were more strongly effected by girls (drastically, in some cases).\nLinks between different types of commuting and body mass index (BMI) were tenuous at best. However, cardiovascular health was clearly raised among active commuters.\nOja et al. (1991): Individuals who walk and bicycle for commuting have better cardiorespiratory health. However, cyclists had better health than walkers.\nPucher et al. (2010): Health effects of commuting were studied at the city, county and state levels. Active commuting lead to a greatly lowered risk of obesity and diabetes, while improving overall cardiovascular health.\nde Hartog et al. (2011): This study took into account the potential for traffic accidents when studying commuting cyclists. It was found that the health gains far outweighed the losses from air pollution and accidents.\n\nStudies on non-active commuting\n\nNieuwenhuijsen et al. (2007): Particulate matter is abundant many metro systems (London's in particular was studied). While this may not pose a large health threat, it nonetheless may have ill effects.\nZuurbier et al. (2010): Levels of exposure to air pollution varied with route, vehicle type, and fuel. Commuters on diesel buses were exposed to higher levels of particles than commuters on electric buses. This is in part because \"self-pollution\" from buses contributes a substantial fraction of all inhaled particles. However, cyclists, too, were exposed to high levels of air pollution.\nChan et al. (2002): Transportation modes of subways, air-conditioned buses, non-air-condition buses, and taxis were studied. Commuters in non-air-conditioned buses were exposed to more particles, while commuters in subways were exposed to substantially fewer. Driving time did not seem to effect exposure.\n\nStudies on general commuting\n\nHansson et al. (2011): The study cites previous studies that have shown commuting to raise stress levels under certain conditions (e.g. long travel times and crowded places). Examples are Evans & Wener (2006) and Evans & Wener (2007). Other, more complicated, effects have been observed, including loss of sleep and an increase in sick leave.\nThe study itself followed the population of the county of Scania, in southern Sweden. Commuters had been sent surveys that covered a variety of issues, including stress and mental health. Some correlations were found between demographics and modes of transport (which was to be expected), which most likely influenced the results. The authors found that, in general, commuters had worse sleep and lower energy. Mental health did not appear to be related. \nHowever, given that the results were self-reported, only 56% of people responded to the survey, and there were patterns between various demographics and modes of transportation, the results are not conclusive, even given the vast number of individuals studied. Other effects may have had significant impacts.\nRoberts et al. (2011): Commuting can have negative psychological effects in women, while those same effects are not visible in men.\nZuurbier et al. (2011): Commuters using active and passive transport may be exposed to higher levels of particulate matter from air pollution. This may cause low-level respiratory effects.\nKnibbs et al. (2011): Different modes of transportation for commuters lead to different levels of exposure to particles in the air. From least exposure to most exposure, the results were: bicycle, bus, automobile, rail, walking, and ferry. This shows a significantly higher exposure among walkers than among cyclists, meaning that active transport is not necessarily better than passive transport in this respect.\n\n\nSummary\nCardiovascular health from exercise and exposure to air pollution are the two main effects of commuting, although commuting may have minor effects on stress and mental health. Cyclists and walkers had much better cardiovascular health than non-active commuters in cars, buses, trains, and subways. This may lead to lower risks of obesity and diabetes.\nExposure to air pollution varied. Commuters using the subways were exposed to different levels of different air particles than aboveground commuters. Commuters in some buses were exposed to high levels of air pollution; however, walkers and cyclists were exposed to high(er) levels in some cases. This exposure can lead to respiratory problems, although this has not yet been studied in great detail.\n", "dermatology - Why are retinoids applied only after washing the face?": "\nBoth retinoids and benzoyl peroxide must be absorbed by the skin to do their work. If you have make-up on or oily skin etc. this can be a barrier to absorption so must be cleaned off. The cleaner your skin, the more is absorbed and therefore the more effective it is.\nTretinoin is a synthetic form of a retinoid used to treat acne however the mechanism of action is identical to all other retinoids so the information is applicable in general. Guidelines and further information for the use of 'tretinoin' which is a type of retinoid can be found below.\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2778128/\nBenzoyl peroxide is an anti-microbial also used to treat acne, in fact it has been used in combination with retinoids as evidence shows they are more effective together.

Insulin resistance is highly predictive of diabetes. In the Bruneck study, less than 10% of the insulin resistant subjects had no other metabolic disorder. But still, the exact relationship between insulin resistance and obesity is unclear, as they could\n\nhave a common cause, or \none of them causes the other, or \nbe coupled in a positive feedback cycle, or\nall of the above. But we know that they are highly correlated in untreated patients. \n\n\nThis is the prevalence of insulin resistance in adolescents from NHANES, with white circles denoting normal weight adolescents, black squares denoting overweight adolescents and black circles denoting obese adolescents. \nFor example, one of the theories for the progression to diabetes is that the capacity of the body's usual fat depots is overtaxed, leading to having too much fat where it does not belong (e.g. intraabdominal fat deposits), resulting in lipotoxicity and finally diabetes. This would be a potential argument for obesity leading to insulin resistance. A common cause could be searched e.g. in reduced incretin secretion or increased JNK activity. But given the difficulty of finding a clear mechanism, and the complexity of the pathways involved, the connection is probably multifactorial.  \nWeight loss is one of the goals in diabetes management. Exercise and dieting delay the progression of prediabetic stages to diabetes. They reduce both obesity and insulin resistance. So, to answer your question directly, if you had insulin resistance, and you managed to lose weight, it is very likely that your insulin sensitivity has increased. \nThe above assumes that the patient is not taking any metabolic treatment. If he is taking diabetes medications, their effect on insulin sensitivity and weight will be independent. Some medication classes like GLP 1 agonists will reduce both obesity and insulin related effects, as will bariatric surgery. Metformin will improve insulin sensitivity without affecting weight much, while the glitazones reduce insulin resistance but lead to weight gain. \n", "medications - Do we have a general system of class of drugs that a layman can understand?": "\nThere is no need for any person to learn any drug taxonomy, unless this person is creating or extensively using clinical or pharmacological documentation. I don't doubt that somewhere, a single unified taxonomy of drugs exists, prescribed by some standardization body - and I also don't doubt that it's a major pain to use and as hated by physicians as ICD-10. \nFor all medical purposes outside of documentation, people use categorization the same way they do it for all other concepts in their life. They put a label on any group they (and hopefully their communication partner) readily recognize. And what they recognize depends on their level of expertise in the field. \nThis is why you, the patient, will naturally say \"drugs for migraine\" while talking to a friend of physician. A physician will use categories such as \"serotonin receptor agonists\". Neither of you two studied a taxonomy tree of drugs before using a correct category name. You knew \"there are migraines\" and derived a proper category name from it. The physician learned about the role of serotonin in the brain, and one chapter of his textbook explained how serotonin is connected to migraine, and another explained how there are drugs which mimic the effects of serotonin by activating the same receptors which are usually activated by serotonin, so they can stop a migraine. \nNote that the two categories are not the same, even though they have some overlap. Some serotonin receptor agonists are a type of migraine drugs. But there are migraine drugs which are not serotonin receptor agonists, and there are serotonin receptor agonists which do something other than heal migraine, because they activate a slightly different set of serotonin receptors. But there is no simple way to translate the category \"serotonin receptor agonists\" to layman's terms. It's not even a matter of it resulting from too detailed criteria, and saying that it's good for a layman to learn the more general category above it - because the more general category of \"receptor agonist\" is not easier to understand. Experts' taxonomies are not simply more detailed versions of a layman's taxonomy of the same area, they are orthogonal to laymen taxonomies, because they are based on completely different principles. \nIf what you want is a categorization system reflecting your current knowledge, then you already have it. Talking about \"drugs for fever\" or \"drugs for migraine\" is not wrong in any way. Just say whatever you mean when you need it. There could be a category which you need to talk about but cannot come up with a succinct name for it, such as \"drugs for fever which are safe for toddlers and are taken through the mouth\" - but it is unlikely that it already makes a node in somebody else's standardized taxonomy, you have to describe it. And while your doctor might be inclined to use the description \"pediatric oral antipyretic\" instead, this does not make your label less valid. \nIf you want to be able to work with a more intricate taxonomy, you'll need more medical knowledge. And that's great - everybody can use knowledge about such an important subject. But in this case, the knowledge comes first. Using the correct taxonomy will come naturally, as a byproduct of your increased knowledge. The other way round does not work. \nOf course, it can happen that you come across information which refers to a category you don't understand, for example in the list of interactions of a drug you are taking. But if you want to understand this information, the way is not through some special taxonomy (which cannot be mapped to concepts you already know anyway). If you really need to know what makes a class of drug a \"class\" and not a random collection of drugs, and a source you find does not explain it in terms you understand, you need another source which will try to explain the criteria behind the existing expert's category. I'm sure the users of this site will be happy to help you in this, too. \n", "nutrition - Olive oil versus sunflower oil": "\nActually, sunflower oil is very high in omega 6 and poor in omega 3 which isn't a good thing considering that the body needs a good balance between omega 6 and omega 3 to be healthy, and most modern food is way too high in omega 6.\nIn my opinion there aren't good oils and bad oils, it's all a matter of balance. I personally use olive oil for hot dishes, and colza oil for salads and stuff... most of the time. But you still can try and pick most of the oils if you feel curious (I think that palm oil is the only vegetable oil which isn't good for health even if used just a little).\nSources\n\nHow to Optimize Your Omega-6 to Omega-3 Ratio\nThe Shocking Truth About Sunflower Oil\n\n", "cancer - Is hydrogen peroxide therapy (drinking it) safe?": "\nIngestion of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), especially very high strength H2O2, can be very dangerous and can cause some serious health risks and possibly even death. \nA United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announcement made in 20061 says that drinking high strength H2O2, specifically H2O2 of 35%, is extremely dangerous and can cause several serious side effects. \"Ingesting hydrogen peroxide can cause gastrointestinal irritation or ulceration.\" It can also cause other health risks, some of which can be life threatening. \nAnother article from 20072 talks about a specific incident in which a 39 year old man accidentally drank 250mL of 35% H2O2. Though the man did not experience the worst possible side effects, he did have to go to the hospital and he did experience damage in his stomach. This is a good example of a real life situation in which H2O2 was consumed, and it did not turn out well. Another real world example3 turned out much sadder. A 2 year old girl swallowed two sips of 35% H2O2 and died. This happened because of a cytotoxic (cell-killing) injury in the tissues and formation of oxygen gas (oxygen toxicity) caused by the H2O2.\nIngestion of 35% H2O2 is undeniably dangerous, but what about lower concentrations of H2O2, such as 3%? A study from the 1990's4 studied 670 cases of mostly children being exposed, usually orally, to 3% H2O2. \"Exposure to hydrogen peroxide 3% is usually benign, however, severe gastric injury may occur following small ingestions in children.\" Overall, they found that a majority of the children were not affected by the low concentration H2O2, but there were special cases in which bad outcomes did occur. \nOverall, we can see that safeness of drinking H2O2 varies depending on what the concentration is. High concentrations, 35%, are extremely dangerous and should never be consumed, but low concentrations, 3%, present low risks. Now, the question is do the benefits of 3% H2O2 outweigh the risks. \nI have been unable to find any reliable sources showing that health benefits of drinking H2O2 of any concentration. Usually, it is used as a topical solution for minor cuts and wounds, not as something to be taken orally. Though the ingestion of 3% H2O2 hasn't been shown to be consistently dangerous, there have been cases of damage in the stomach and other parts of the body.5 H2O2 poisoning can be very dangerous, even with low concentrations of it, so I would not recommend drinkin H2O2, ever.

In average, it depends on age, sex and total (consumed) fluid volume. Several factors contribute to this rhythm:\n\nThe rhythm of glomerular filtration rate of the kidneys. They decrease filtration of urine at night.\nMany of the hormones which influence renal urine production - and also the parasympathetic/sympathetic nervous system, which controls bladder function - follow observable day and night rhythms. \nThe former study also states that there is a possibility for regulatory clock genes, which might directly influence urine production or the urge to urinate.  They could be located in the bladder itself or the neurons controlling its function, or in the kidneys. \n\nThe role of this rhythm is still unclear. In mice, the circadianic rhythm of urine excretion was lost 2 days into exposure to total darkness.\nSo, altogether, there is evidence of multifactorial contributions to an observable circadianic rhythm of urine excretion of unknown purpose. But it is clear that at night, your kidneys filtrate and thus produce less, and the tonus of the bladder muscles is also decreased, in summary leading to your bladder preserving more urine for the morning, possibly \"to give you some rest\" at night. And it is also clear that if you're a man, it is not going to get better with age, and this is very likely due to the increase of their prostate volume.\n", "When was brain cancer first discovered?": "\nAccording to this source and this, brain cancer was first discovered in 1873 and brain tumor before that.

As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said, \u201cThis one came out first.\u201d But when he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, \u201cSo this is how you have broken out!\u201d And he was named Perez.  Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out. And he was named Zerah.\" - Genesis 38: 27-30\n\nIt is implied that before birth, they knew the mother had twins. \n\nAny good midwife can determine when a woman is carrying twins. The uterus will be bigger, and there will be excess everything: excess heads, excess rumps, excess backbones (these are things that can actually be felt and located on manual examination). Late in the pregnancy, if both twins are head down (the usual and most common presentation), there will be two rumps up top.\n\nThe first thing to come out of the womb was one baby's arm... The arm goes back into the womb.\n\nIn my medical experience delivering babies (I've delivered a significant number), this is fairly unlikely if the story is told without including pauses. For one thing, the waters would have had to have broken - at least one sac if they were dichorionic diamniotic twins, which is most common for non-identical twins (which they were). This usually occurs very close to the time of birth, when the pelvis would be already occupied by a head. There's not a lot of room for hands and arms to be swinging freely in there. \n\n\nThe first thing to come out of the womb was one baby's arm (upon which the first thing the midwife does is tie a crimson thread to it).\n\nHowever, compound presentations may occur in a \"roomy\" pelvis, and are more likely to occur when the pelvis is not fully occupied by the fetus because of low birth weight, multiple gestation, polyhydramnios, or a large pelvis. They occur in singleton pregnancies about once in ~1500 births, and usually, the \"misplaced\" part is a hand or arm. In general, if left unattended, the hand will retract or the arm will extend further as labor progresses.\n\n...unborn children have all their reflexes in utero, [therefore] unborn babies are fully capable, within the limitations of the space available, of reacting as they would as newborns. The simplest approach, therefore, may be to apply a benign noxious stimulus, such as a gentle pinch to a fingertip of the advancing hand. By applying a benign noxious stimulus (between contractions, of course), the hand may withdraw and never appear in the undesired position again.\n\nIn Genesis, note that the hand alone came out, and since it usually retracts, this is possible. The tying of thread around the infant's arm might be enough noxious stimuli to cause it to retract.\nAs I said, with twins there's less room, however\n\nRupture of membranes when the presenting part is still high also increases the risk of compound presentation, cord prolapse, or both... In multiple gestations, a possible scenario involves the head of the first twin and an extremity of the second twin within the birth canal.\n\nWhich would be the exact scenario described in Genesis.\nDichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy\nImage from About Multiple Birth Pregnancy\nCompound Presentations\nManagement of the fetus with compound presentation \n", "dermatology - Is drawing with a pen on my wrist regularly unhealthy?": "\n\nIt is usually only a problem in Ink poisoning:\n\n\nWriting ink poisoning occurs when someone swallows ink found in\nwriting instruments (pens).\n\nAnd\n\nAllergies to skin: Irritation to skin, burning or itching.

An average person has about 50 dl of blood circulating in their veins, or about 5 grams of glucose total. If all 24 grams of sugar entered the blood stream instantly, that would cause the blood sugar level to rise by around 480 mg/dL, which would be well above the level defined as acute hyperglycemia and high enough to put a person into the emergency room or even cause death.\n", "lasting effects duration - Does BMR adjust and decrease in response to calorie restriction diets?": "\nYes it can.  As a general statement, I'm not sure how much it can go down before it's a problem, which is what I think you are asking as your second question.  Starving to death might be seen as this taking the BMR close to zero (though I don't think you would get to zero before death).\nI think a good reference for this is Peter Emery's review article \"Metabolic changes in malnutrition.\"  There may be more appropriate references when concerning elective reductions in caloric intake, but I suspect the results are similar on a smaller scale.\nThere are a few sections of the review that are worth quoting and discussing here:\nFirst the general trend and cause:\n\nThe basal metabolic rate actually increases during the first few days\n  of starvation, under the influence of catecholamines that are secreted\n  in response to decreasing blood glucose concentrations. This\n  probably reflects the high rate of gluconeogenesis that occurs at this\n  time. As fasting progresses, however, metabolic rate decreases as free\n  T3 and catecholamine levels decrease and the rate of gluconeogenesis\n  decreases.\n\nIn essence, when you first start to fast (the references [1,2] that the review sites are from 1-4 days in this section) the body looks to other sources of energy (gluconeogenesis).  That is not sustainable over time, and then the BMR begins to drop.  How it begins to drop is largely through the lost of lean tissue, with a focus on muscle mass, which is probably a good evolutionary choice over more important systems such as the brain:\n\nThe response to a less severe degree of food restriction can also be\n  seen as a series of adaptive processes with the same priorities, that\n  is to maintain the supply of glucose to the brain and to minimise the\n  loss of lean tissue. Basal metabolic rate decreases to minimise the\n  negative energy balance. This is achieved partly by loss of\n  metabolically active tissue, but there is also some evidence that the\n  efficiency of energy metabolism increases leading to a decrease in\n  energy expenditure per unit cell mass.\n\nAgain, the referenced review article is also worth a read, especially as it deals with otherwise healthy individuals and people \"dieting\" in the common sense of the word (but in no means the medical).  Again body composition and physical activity take a leading role here, but changes in efficiency are certainly noted if not understood.  A conclusion reached on efficiency calculation (ibid) is also worth quoting:\n\nIt would thus appear that the generally used indicator of metabolic\n  efficiency in humans, that is a reduced oxygen consumption per unit\n  fat free mass, is fraught with problems since it does not account for\n  variations in contributions from sub-compartments of the fat free mass\n  which include those with high metabolism at rest such as brain and\n  viscera and those with low metabolism at rest such as muscle mass.\n\nWhen in your life span you start on your low caloric diet can effect the outcome of the diet.  A commonly understood example is a shorter stature/smaller skeletal frame will develop under limited nutritional intake.  It's probably worth noting that on an evolutionary scale, having too many calories is an exceedingly new problem.  In other words, even if we wouldn't see it as preferential in the developed world today, it is probably an adaptive response to lose lean body mass or not develop additional skeletal structure (with goals of efficiency).  \nI will end returning Dr. Emery's coverage of the same topic:\n\nThe main response in chronically malnourished populations is slow\n  growth rate, delayed maturity, and small adult stature. Small stature\n  can be seen as a successful adaptation to low-energy intake because\n  overall basal metabolic rate will be low. However, when metabolic rate\n  is adjusted for fat-free mass there is no significant difference\n  between those who are most malnourished and those who are well\n  nourished. The reason for this is that the main deficit in lean\n  tissue mass is in muscle, which has a relatively low metabolic rate,\n  while the size of the visceral organs, which are much more\n  metabolically active, is much less affected. Hence these changes in\n  body composition may cancel out any increase in the efficiency of\n  cellular metabolism.\n\n", "terminology - Can someone explain these cancer names?": "\nThe causal sequence indicated here doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me. Having signed many death certificates, I can sympathize with the doctor who signed off on it. Generally, these have to be typed up in a form (in my experience, on a typewriter....). Someone other than the doctor usually does that, which means there is some verbal communication between the doctor and an administrative person about what should go in the blanks and... it doesn\u2019t always come out exactly perfectly. \nColon carcinoma is generally used to indicate a primary tumor of the epithelial cells of the colon. That is, the cells lining the inside of the colon underwent a mutation of some sort that caused a cancerous growth. \nAbdominal carcinomatosis is what happens when cancer cells fall off (basically) the tumor and \u201cseed\u201d the peritoneal space, which is the area outside the gut but inside the abdomen.

The natural lower limit to metabolism is death: if a person restricts calories too much, their metabolism drops lower and lower, until they develop various complications and then die. The natural upper limit to metabolism is, in my view, heat: a person's metabolism is only going to increase naturally to a certain point, based on their BMI, body composition, genetics, lifestyle, etc., and after that point the metabolism will not increase any more otherwise excessive heat would be generated (also leading to death.) A example of dysfunctional metabolism where people just burn more and more energy is the misuse of the now-unavailable drug mimicking \"uncoupling protein\" (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/death-of-medical-student-sarah-houston-after-taking-banned-slimming-drug-dinitrophenol-highlights-8584597.html). BUT this is an example where a drug was taken that dysregulated metabolism. Normally the body will not allow the metabolism to increase like that. What happens instead in the natural world is obesity. If you increase calories too much, past the point of metabolic increase, then extra calories are stored as fat and you become obese.\n", "nutrition - Do artificial sweeteners cause insulin spikes?": "\nThere is a good article on that in Nature, where in a study it was found that non-caloric artificial sweeteners (NAS) in fact do lead to a rise of serum insuline levels, possibly via a induced change of the gut flora, proven by the fact that the effect could be reproduced after fecal transplantation in mice. (Full article here)\nAnd this is about the status of scientific knowledge about it. There is a good review on the NAS topic in childrens' diets.\nAlso, Aspartame exposure during pregnancy has been found to reduce insulin sensitivity in male mice, thereby showing a gender difference and other side effects.\nSo, to answer the question: By today's knowledge it's yes, they may cause insulin spikes, but rather indirectly. But nonetheless, they produce measurable adverse effects on your glucose homeostasis, the pathways of which are still not quite clear but may - amongst others - have to do with your gut flora, your insulin receptor sensitivity or behaviourial mechanisms of the brain reacting to sweet taste.\n", "Are consumable goods from stores safety tested?": "\nNo, products that comply with FDA guidelines are not tested before being offered to the public for sale.\nIt is impossible - literally* - to test every batch of ice cream, spinach, frozen hamburger, etc. that is shipped out to supermarkets for sale. The FDA relies on the good intentions of the manufacturer to follow its guidelines and results of evaluations. If they do not, they are held responsible for damages inflicted on the public, as well as punitive damages and fines.\nIn the example of ice cream, the FDA has guidelines for the facilities that produce the product based on years of studies and experience. They include cleaning recommendations, temperatures at certain stages, the amount of time the product must spend at certain temperatures, etc. The facilities are inspected routinely, and when a product ends up contaminated, the FDA does a new inspection and reviews the previous inspections for evidence that previous recommendations were ignored, or might have prevented what occurred. In other words, it's a continuous process that relies on the manufacturer to keep in compliance with FDA guidelines. Facilities that don't comply face recalls, fines, and ultimately closure.\nThe Blue Bell Ice Cream Listeria outbreak is a good case study in the process. The process can be examined here and by following the links within. \n*The costs would be prohibitive to test for every possible pathogen and contaminant.\n", "infection - Stray cat scratch - tetanus?": "\nNo one can predict the future, nor can we diagnose over the internet, so I won't address that aspect of your question. However, I can tell you why the doctor wanted the following shots.\nTetanus immunization: Any time a person gets a \"dirty\" wound* (animal bites and cat scratches are considered dirty - think of what a cat does with it's paws), tetanus immunization should be considered if the last immunization was more than 5 years ago (10 years if it's a clean wound.)\nTetanus Immune Globulin: for dirty wounds in people with an unknown history of prior immunization, or if 2 or fewer doses in the past.  Often in the past, elderly individuals were unimmunized against tetanus because of the availability and scheduling of the immunization. The TIG is recommended because the tetanus toxoid - the \"tetanus vaccine\" - takes a while (and several doses) to induce immunity. The TIG provides immediate but temporary immunity by directly providing antitoxin. \nRabies/Rabies Immune Globulin - for any bite from an animal of unknown status. Nonbite exposures rarely cause rabies, however that does not mean never. Such exposures should be evaluated for possible postexposure prophylaxis administration. If someone lives in an area where a significant numbers of rabid animals are known to exist, the recommendations will be different than in an area where rabies is rarely detected.\nHowever, if the cat can be caught and quarantined (if the animal can be found and held for observation), a physician may delay this treatment.\nIt's a bit late now, but soap and water should be your first line of treatment for dirty wounds; if rabies is a possibility, apply Betadine/providone iodine after using soap and water.\nSigns of wound infection include: puffiness, warmth, pain, redness extending outward from the wound, discharge of pus, a foul smell, streaks going up from the wound towards the body, fever, chills or muscle aches.\nYou can always go back to the doctor if you are worried. It's never \"too late\". You should also read about the signs and symptoms of tetanus, which is the results of an infection where the toxin spreads through the body. You cannot tell by looking at a wound if it's \"tetanus\". You can only tell if it's tetanus prone.\nIf you live in the US, you can often discuss the need for rabies prophylaxis not only with a doctor, but by calling your local or state Department of Health.\nAgain, it's never too late to see a doctor, and you should do so if you have any concerns (which you clearly do.)\nAlso, the doctor should address whether other tetanus shots should be given and when.\n*Such as, but not limited to, wounds contaminated with dirt, feces, soil, and saliva; puncture wounds; avulsions; and wounds resulting from missiles, crushing, burns, and frostbite.\nPersons with wounds that are neither clean nor minor, and who have had fewer than 3 prior doses of tetanus toxoid or have an unknown history of prior doses should receive TIG as well as Td or Tdap. This is because early doses of toxoid may not induce immunity, but only prime the immune \nsystem. The TIG provides temporary immunity by directly providing antitoxin. This ensures that protective levels of antitoxin are achieved even if an immune response has not yet occurred. - CDC, (Pink Book) Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, 13th Edition\nNonbite exposures from terrestrial animals rarely cause rabies. However, occasional reports of rabies transmission by nonbite exposures suggest that such exposures should be evaluated for possible postexposure prophylaxis administration. - CDC\n\n", "medications - Can oral contraceptives prevent ovarian cysts from forming?": "\n\n[I]s it logical/healthy to take in oral contraceptives on a regular basis even if one is not engaged in intercourse?\n\nThere are several reasons to take oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) that have nothing to do with contraception. In that way, they can be considered medications to treat medical conditions, not contraceptives.\nIn the case of women who bleed heavily during their periods, or those have their periods too frequently or irregularly, OCP's can reduce the amount of bleeding preventing anemia and can \"regulate\" cycles. \nWhen a woman has excessive pain with menstruation, OCPs can decrease the pain significantly. If women suffer from debilitating premenstrual dysphoric disorder symptoms (aka PMS), OCP help considerably.\nOCPs have been used to treat acne, hirsutism (excessive body hair, especially facial), and significant menstrual-related migraines.\nIn women with premature menopause, OCP's can decrease the risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer.\nInterestingly, OCPs are not considered a good treatment of functional ovarian cysts, though intuitively one would think they were. \n\nMost patients are unaware of these health benefits and therapeutic uses of oral contraceptives, and they tend to overestimate their risk. Counseling and education are necessary to help women make well-informed health-care decisions ...\n\nAs with any medication, discussion about the risks of OCP use should take place with the prescribing physician, and in the case of the benefits outweighing the risks, the choice to treat the condition with OCPs is quite logical. \nNoncontraceptive benefits and therapeutic uses of the oral contraceptive pill.\nACOG Guidelines on Noncontraceptive Uses of Hormonal Contraceptives\nHormonal treatment of functional ovarian cysts: a randomized, prospective study.\nConsensus on infertility treatment related to polycystic ovary syndrome\nEffect of Long-Term Treatment with Metformin Added to Hypocaloric Diet on Body Composition, Fat Distribution, and Androgen and Insulin Levels in Abdominally Obese Women with and without the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome\n", "ergonomics - How can I sit ergonomically on the floor when using a low table?": "\nThere are a few tricks which can make the cross-legged position comfortable:\n\nSitting more \"crossy\" - if you are not flexible enough to align your heels one in front of another, cross your ankles or even cross your shins.\nElevate the hips above your knees (by using a cushion, blanket or yoga-block)\nSupport your knees (again using cushions or something similar).\n\nThese \"tricks\" come from yoga practitioners:\n\nIf you choose to sit cross-legged, it is important to have your knees level with or below your hips. If you are having difficulty maintaining an erect spine while sitting cross-legged, begin by sitting on the edge of a cushion, bolster, or rolled blanket. For additional support, place rolled blankets or bolsters under your knees. (You may find that with the knees supported, the inner groins relax and that when you take the supports away, your knees drop further easily.)\n\nYou can see this demonstration video\nApart from this, when you feel physical strain, a good idea is to make a break and stand up for a few minutes. This doesn't apply just to sitting on the floor, by the way, because sitting for a long time (regardless of the position) is connected with health risks and some experts recommend a break from sitting every 30 minutes. \n\nI don't have references for this part: the pain you are feeling might be caused by low flexibility (especially in the hips), but also week abdominal and paravertebral muscles (both of which are important for a good, straight-back posture). Working on these issues over time might help, but, as with any exercise program, you need to be aware of your general health and whether you have any specific health issues, so that you can exercise safely.\n", "What factors affect exercise induced nausea?": "\nThe simple answer is \"metabolic lactic acidosis\". \n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the duration of exercise and intensity (aerobic vs anaerobic) and prior food or drink consumption are the main factors contributing to this effect.\n\nActually, the Wiki articles doesn't quite say that (?).\nPrior food/drink would determine the glucose and glycogen - the stored form of glucose - available. Also, hydration is important.\nThe very, very, very small study (12 volunteers) linked by Wikipedia concludes that \n\nnausea [was] greater during exercise at fasting state and immediately after eating [a hamburger patty] than those without exercise (p<0.05 during low-intensity exercise, and p<0.01 during high-intensity exercise). Immediately after eating, scores for nausea were greater during high-intensity exercise than during low-intensity exercise (p<0.05). During high-intensity exercise, scores for nausea were greater immediately after eating than without eating (p<0.05).\n\nNormally, muscles using glucose as an energy source produce a 3-carbon molecule called pyruvic acid (or pyruvate). In the presence of oxygen, the pyruvate is further metabolized into CO2, which is carried by the blood and exhaled from the lungs. \nExercising beyond a certain point causes muscles to burn glucose under anaerobic (no oxygen) conditions (the blood cannot deliver oxygen to the muscles quickly enough.) The result is that pyruvate is converted into lactate (lactic acid) instead of CO2 which is released from the muscle cells into the bloodstream, where it accumulates over time. Since lactate is a relatively strong acid, it results in a decreased pH (an increase in free hydrogen ions, or H+) of the blood. This is called lactic acidosis.\nNormally, H+ in the blood is efficiently handled by a buffer, bicarbonate.\n\nThe direction of the equation in the case of acidosis is driven to the left by the concentration of hydrogen ions. Normally, the CO2 that is formed is simply exhaled by increasing the respiratory rate. This decreases the H* concentration and is called compensatory respiratory alkalosis.\nThere is respiratory compensation whereby the body increases breathing to expel H+ in the form of CO2. \nIn the presence of excess H+, the body tries to compensate metabolically by increasing HCO3-, which takes time. With continued exercise, the body cannot 'make' enough HCO3- to handle all the H+, and the blood's pH falls.\nThis is the situation which results in nausea and vomiting if serious enough.\nIntroduction to Acid-Base Disorders <- click through \n", "nutrition - Would it be better to have fruits on an empty stomach rather after a full meal?": "\nThis rumor is common enough that there is even a Snopes article about it.\nIn essence no, this doesn't help, and is in fact closer to the opposite of the truth.  When eating a meal many more digestive enzymes and processes are started up then when only eating a small amount or say a pill.  This is one of the reason you should always take your multivitamin with or immediately after a meal.  The key factor here is known as gastric emptying, or how quickly the food is going through you.  When it happens quickly, only the nutrients that are easy to absorb (like fats) are obtained.  Eating more food at once (to a point) slows gastric emptying allowing for more complete digestion.\nThere are two key aspects when looking at the digestion of fruit.  The first, and perhaps obvious, benefit is the absorption of nutrients.  All of the calories, vitamins, etc that one can get out of fruit falls into this category.  The second benefit is that of fiber which can help clear the gut of waste, bowel motility, maintenance of gut flora, and other uses that call for both soluble and non-soluble fibers which fruits are rich in.  A very good review on their benefit can be found here.\nBut what about when they are mixed together with other things?  When compared to milk and oatmeal, blue berries were found to have a synergistic effect with oatmeal, but milk was found to be inhibitory to both.  If you are willing to take an example with pigs, fruits and vegetables protected against some of the more harmful effects of a high fat and protein diet when eaten at the same time (though this could be because of simple decreases in the fat intake).\n", "time of day - Is drinking water during or after a meal better?": "\n\nRemember not to drink too soon before or after a meal as the water will dilute the digestive juices\n\nWhile that claim might sound reasonable at first, I doubt this has any effect you need to consider for your health.  There's several reasons for this:\n\nThe stomach normally contains about 20 to 100 milliliters of stomach acid at a pH of around 2 to 3. To change pH by one point, you need to dilute it 1:10. If the stomach contains 50 milliliters at a pH of 2, for example, half a litre is needed to get it up to a pH of 3.\nThe effect definitely isn't negligible, but it's less than you might think because stomach acid is a very strong acid. An acid with a pH of 3 or even 4 is still a strong acid, and unlikely to cause problems - the medical condition of achlorhydria is only diagnosed when the stomach acid pH is greater than 5 in men or 6.8 in women.\n\nThe stomach is capable of regulating pH if needed -  for example, in a study on preoperative patients, one group was allowed to drink water and one wasn't. The mean water intake was 400 milliliters for the group that was allowed to. The stomach acid in the two groups didn't differ significantly in either volume (which was just 20 milliliters) or acidity.\n\n\n\nDrink water an hour after the meal to allow the body to absorb the nutrients.\n\n\nFood stays in the stomach for 2 to 4 hours, so the recommendation to wait one hour is weird. What's more, food itself contains water and thus does lower the acidity of the stomach - that's normal. Since it can be regulated (see above) it's very doubtful that a bit of water on top is going to screw things up\n\nWhat do these sources think will happen with these nutrients? After the hours in the stomach, there's an additional 3 hours in the small intestine and 30 to 40 hours in the colon for the food. The colon and the stomach do have different roles in digestion, but in general, the digestive tract is pretty good at extracting nutrients from food\n\n\nAs a doctor writes for the Mayo Clinic (yes, I know that link is in your question):\n\nThere's no concern that water will dilute the digestive juices or interfere with digestion.\n\nDrink water when you want to drink water. Also, don't trust sites that tell you to drink water to \"activate your internal organs\" in the morning  ;-)\n", "sleep - Sleeping on stomach - why are people naturally drawn to it if it's bad?": "\nSleeping in a prone position is not bad. However there are some complications of it that can be negative. A simple example is drooling. A more important problem with sleeping in a prone position is poor posture. Most people don't have a bed like a chiropractic table that allows them to breathe with their face straight down while maintaining a neutral spine. Due to this lack of beds designed for the prone sleeper they have to turn their head to the side. This extreme rotation held for 8 hours can cause neck pain. Most people who sleep that way also use a pillow under their head and/or upper body causing excessive and prolonged lumbar extension. This can lead to low back pain. J Amer Chiropr Assoc 2011 May-June;48(4):17-18\nThe textbooks and the research I've seen always say the best sleep position maintains a neutral spine. That means on your back with a pillow supporting your neck and one supporting your knees. Alternatively you can sleep on your side with a pillow supporting your neck, head, and the top arm as well as a pillow between the knees. This will keep the spine in a neutral position. I always tell my patients that the best way to sleep is the one that gives you a good, full nights sleep. You can probably improve your sleep with a few modifications, but if you are a side sleeper, you'll have a difficult time trying to force yourself to your back because, you're not conscious at the time. The Mayo Clinic has some excellent images that can help with modifications. \nPeople tend to sleep in positions that are comfortable for them. If all day long they sit or work in a flexed posture then their body may crave the extension of their low back that comes from prone positions. In fact they may sleep prone because of back pain caused by excessive flexion. We've all seen this phenomenon before as we squirm in our chair or our legs ache to stretch when on a long flight or car ride. Motion and proper posture affects every aspect of our life. More research can be found here  (No Affiliation).\n", "nutrition - Do vitamins affect sense of taste?": "\nSo it's important to separate cravings/specific hungers from taste.  \nOne's body should, to some degree be able to adjust it's specific hungers to meet it's dietary needs.  This one area where our larger brains come with a catch 22.  While being smarter and aware allows us to feed ourselves better, we also can ignore or improperly process the bodies attempt to control our appetites.\nMoving on to taste buds (here is a better review than wiki).  The average taste bud lasts 8-12 days (ibid), so if you're noticing an effect before then, it's probably not related.  Also, there development and distribution is associated with genetic and epigenetic factors, not environment and diet.\nInstead I think that you are noticing that your taste receptors, like most sensory systems, become less responsive after saturation and repeated stimulation.\nIf we look at part F of the following figure:\n\nYou will notice how the response of the taste bud to a salty solution decreased significantly after each application (the time between each stimulus was 10 min).  Thus something that started as tasty and salty 30 min ago won't by the time you've finished gorging yourself on oranges.\nA way to test this at home, with the extreme caveat that I do not recommend super dosing vitamin C, would be to try this with a fixed dose (appropate for age and weight) of vitamin C dissolved in water over the same interval you were eating the oranges.  I think you will notice little to no change in the taste of the vitamin C unless you are doing it in a very short amount of time.\n", "Are there variations in blood cholesterol by age?": "\nLevels generally increase until the ages of 50-60, then fall.\nIn children, levels of LDL and HDL generally either rise or fall monotonically (i.e. continuously) over childhood; see Dai et al. (2009). LDL-C was found to decrease in both genders, while HDL-C was found to increase in girls and fluctuate in boys.\nThe NIH says of adults\n\nBlood cholesterol begins to rise around age 20 and continues to go up until about age 60 or 65. Before age 50, men\u2019s total cholesterol levels tend to be higher than those of women of the same age\u2014after age 50, the opposite happens.\n  That\u2019s because with menopause, women\u2019s LDL levels often rise.\n\nAfter about the age of 50, both men and women generally experience a fall in blood cholesterol levels (see Ferrara et al. (1997)).\nAdditionally, levels in all age groups may fluctuate according to the seasons (see Ockene et al. (2004) and cited studies therein). However, the reason for this is unknown.\n", "What physical endurance exercise can I fit into a 5-minute routine without any equipment?": "\nWhat not to do\nFirst off, if you're doing situps on the floor, stop it immediately. Floor situps are harmful for your back, and provide little to no effect in terms of abdominal muscle growth.\nWhile pushups are more beneficial, I have to start by saying that 5 minutes isn't enough time to do any work from which to enjoy physical benefits. It might serve as a wake-me-up, but nothing more.\nWhat to do\nMy advice would be to do the plank instead, if you are looking to engage your core musculature. It will tighten your abs, back, chest, glutes, shoulders, and a whole bunch of other muscles if done right.\nIf you want a full-body workout, you're going to have to do more than just a few exercises. Here is a list of some good ones. You obviously don't have to do all 50, but try to do one or two from each section whenever you do get down. There is enough here to provide a good bit of variety, and anyone will tell you that variation is one of the key aspects of a good workout regimen.\nAs far as I can tell, the list only contains one sit-up (all the way at the bottom), but it's a variation that's not entirely disagreeable. I could write an article on why floor sit-ups are bad for you (maybe in another thread), but right now, this seems like a good place to start.\n", "nutrition - What is the relation between the sensation of being full and the ability to fall asleep?": "\n\n...I don't think this is the same as the effect you get on thanksgiving.\n\nActually, it probably is, and soon some people will be able to get that same sleep-inducing effect in the form of a pill.\nYour sleepiness after a meal is caused by the presence or absence decrease of peptides in your brain called orexins (aka hypocretins).\nIn 1998, two groups of researchers simultaneously discovered 2 small neuropeptide hormones that regulate, among other things, wakefulness and feeding behavior. \nOne group discovered them while searching for molecules that could bind to \"orphan\" receptors, that is, a brain receptor with an unknown \"binding\" molecule (called a ligand). They found that the prohormone prepro-orexin was found in a very small area of the hypothalamus which had been implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior and energy homeostasis; this suggested the possibility that the neuropeptides might be involved in the regulation of food intake. When administered into free-feeding rats' brains, one of these peptides (orexin A/hypocretin 1) stimulated food consumption in a dose-dependent manner (with attention to light and dark periods, i.e. the circadian rhythm), with a lower dose increasing rat feeding about 2-fold, and the higher dose inducing a 3+-fold increase in feeding compared to rats injected with a solution without the peptide (the other stimulated feeding to a lesser degree). The effect persisted for 4 hours. Furthermore, fasting rats produced more than twice as much orexins as rats feeding freely. For this reason, the molecules were names \"orexins\", after the Greek word orexis, which means \"appetite\". They speculated that the orexin-secreting neurons might somehow be modulated by glucose.\nAt the same time, another group of researchers using a completely different approach found that the same group of hypothalamic neurons were stimulated by a peptide hormone similar in composition to the gut hormone secretin. They identified the same prohormone and its two peptides, naming them hypocretins for \"hypothalamus\" and \"secretin\". They found that at least one of the peptides had a neuroexcitatory activity in specific areas of the brain (they mapped effects in the hypothalamic neurons, the posterior hypothalamus, the septal nuclei in the basal forebrain, the preoptic area, the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, the central gray, the locus coeruleus, the colliculi, the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract) suggesting that the peptides acted within the central nervous system as homeostatic regulators with a role in nutritional homeostasis.\nScientists have not decided on whether to call them orexins or hypocretins yet, so both are used. They are found in all vertebrates.\n\nMammalian orexin A sequences thus far identified (human, rat, mouse, pig, dog, sheep, and cow) are all identical, whereas the sequences of orexin B show some differences among species. From Orexin/Hypocretin: A Neuropeptide at the Interface of Sleep, Energy Homeostasis, and Reward System, Natsuko Tsujino and Takeshi Sakurai \nIn 1999, a group of scientists found that narcolepsy (a sleep disorder characterized by extreme daytime sleepiness) was caused by a lack of a hypocretin/orexin receptor 2 gene in certain dogs, therefore establishing that they play a very important part in the regulation of wakefulness.*\nSince then, an enormous body of work has shown that orexins/hypocretins (O/H from here on in) are involved in the regulation of a wide range of behaviors, including wakefulness and vigilance (needed to find food), systems that regulate emotion and reward (including drug-seeking behavior when stressed and eating for pleasure - \"consumption beyond homeostatic needs\" - leading to obesity), and more.**\nWhat does eating have to do with sleepiness?\nSeveral studies report that the firing rates of O/H neurons are influenced by serum glucose, triglycerides and amino acids. \nIn English, and in your case: You are awake (O/H is being secreted by O/H neurons in your hypothalamus). You eat. Your serum glucose rises. The elevated glucose causes depolarization of inhibitory neurons that hyperpolarize O/H neurons decreasing the amount of O/H. released. Result: wakefulness decreases. (You can barely make it to your bed, in your case!)\nWhat about Thanksgiving in a pill?\nThe US Food and Drug Administration recently approved suvorexant (Belsomra) for the treatment of chronic insomnia. The (prescription only) drug is an orexin receptor antagonist and is the first approved drug of this type. It blocks the effect of orexin in wakefulness (isn't science grand?) Unlike benzodiazepines and other hypnotics, rather than promoting sleep, suvorexant inactivates wakefulness, and rebound insomnia and withdrawal effects were not observed when suvorexant was discontinued after 3 months or 12 months of nightly use. It does have risks and side effects, but so far its safety profile looks pretty good.\nComparing these two papers - the first and second references - is a wonderful example of the completely different methods used by scientists to investigate unknowns and up with the same basic conclusion.\nOrexins and orexin receptors: a family of hypothalamic neuropeptides and G protein-coupled receptors that regulate feeding behavior, Cell 92 (4): 573\u201385\nThe hypocretins: Hypothalamus-specific peptides with neuroexcitatory activity Proc.

For example, if your gastroenteritis was caused by a norovirus (formerly called Norwalk virus, the most common cause of food poisoning), a blood test for IgM (Immunoglobulin M) to the virus, indicating a recent illness, might be positive.\nHowever, diagnosing after the fact in a short term and self-limiting illness like norovirus infection is harder than diagnosis during the illness (which requires just a small stool sample), unless the pathogen is known with certainty, and even then, there may not be a residual response to test.\nClearly, you will be paying for a large number of tests with only a chance that one of them will come up positive.\nIn terms of getting a doctor's note, it's best if you a) have a prior relationship with the physician, b) call him while you're sick (not after) or c) see a health care provider, go to the school health clinic, a walk-in clinic, or something similar.\nWriting a note after the fact is a tricky area ethically. Many doctors who know and trust their patients will do it without hesitation. But I can understand others simply refusing the request for a post-illness work-up (which might be negative regardless) on the basis of cost and questionable need.\nOr to use a medical metaphor, an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.\nAntibody Test To Detect Genogroup II Norwalk-Like Virus Infection\nAssessment of a rapid immunochromatographic test for the diagnosis of norovirus gastroenteritis.\n", "chemical - Help identifying possible workplace contaminants": "\nFraming the symptoms as mold-like biases thinking through the scenario.

It's fine for people who have relatively small hernias that are asymptomatic. However, it's not a cure. The separation of the abdominal wall muscle is permanent (it's caused by either an inherent weakness at birth, and/or repetitive stress).\nFor inguinal hernias, watchful waiting (deferring surgery until it's necessary due to pain or other symptoms) is a perfectly acceptable way to \"treat\" hernias. Though there is considerable crossover to surgery, in one study, men have been watched for more than 11 years without any mortality and only 2 emergency repairs in a group of 254 men with inguinal hernias. The limitations are on lifting, activities, diet, constipation and other factors; many of the hernias become more painful with time.\nMore than you ever wanted to know about hernia repairs\nLong-term results of a randomized controlled trial of a nonoperative strategy (watchful waiting) for men with minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias.\nA clinician's guide to patient selection for watchful waiting management of inguinal hernia\nManagement of asymptomatic inguinal hernia: a systematic review of the evidence.\n", "musculoskeletal system - How to walk with a Broken collarbone and Leg?": "\nBones should be maximally immobilized. It is very painful and dangerous to move otherwise. \nIt is possible to walk, using only one crutch (I know this by practice). \nProbably it is possible to use it on the side opposite to broken collar bone.\nMost probably, if we have complex fracture, it will be recommended to use carriage, especially on initial stages of recovery.\n", "effectiveness - Is breathing into a paper bag an effective treatment for panic attacks?": "\nI did not find any studies which would investigate that matter. Moreover, in 2008 Nillni and co-workers (1) stated:\n\nSurprisingly, although the expressed goal of breathing training is to correct hyperventilation, pCO2 has never been used as an outcome measure\n\nIn a recent study (2) it was concluded: \n\nClinical improvement must have depended on elements common to both\n  breathing therapies rather than on the effect of the therapies\n  themselves on CO(2) levels.\n\nAs so I would conclude that even in theoretical level there is very limited evidence for that intervention to be effective.\nBut I would your use very different perspective. I bet that if you choose ten people out of the street and ask them \"What would you do if your friend had a panic attack?\" more than half would respond that they would give him/her a paper bag. The use of paper bag as an emergency intervention is a very common factoid. With this matter there exists a major placebo effect with that treatment. Use of paper bag as an emergency measure for person with a panic attack is very cost-effective without any potential side effects so it is an ideal \"intervention\". So I think we should not crave for solid evidence. Due to the factoid matter majority of people think it is an effective treatment and with comes a great placebo effect which should be definitely used due to the cost-effectiveness and safety. \n", "How many smaller muscles compose the interosseus muscle in the human hand?": "\nThe number of interosseous muscles is not constant, because of the evolutional process continuing in modern generations. \nSome individuals have 4 interosseous muscles, other have three, however there are still debates about the subject:\n\n+\n\n", "sleep - Is it possible to maintain my health during irregular sleeping patterns?": "\nYou are correct to be worried about the effect of sleep on your physical health, especially because you seem to have bad luck (or bad genes) when it comes to serious infectious disease.  \nAnyway, back to the issue of sleep as it relates to infectious disease:\n Sleep deprivation attenuates antibody responses to vaccine,\n whereas good sleep imparts long-lasting immunoenhancing effects.\n Furthermore, sleep is a profound regulator of cellular immunity\n and formation of immunological memory critical for adaptive\n responses to immune challenges.\n -- from: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3695049/\n\nSo it's safe to presume that your lack of sleep is impairing your health.

That said, if you wish to avoid the discomfort, existing videos might get the point across.\n", "symptoms - Mitigating / Stopping hiccups": "\nI summarized the mechanism of hiccups in a question on biology.SE a few months ago. That may be useful background information for the answer to this question about what interventions work.\nRegarding the available data, as usual a Cochrane Review provides the best meta-analysis, and as usual they conclude that there is insufficient evidence for anything. However, in practicality there are decent observational data available.\nBecause hiccups stem from a reflex arc involving the vagal nerve, physical maneuvers that stimulate the vagus often abort hiccups.\nThese may include:   \n\nBreath holding\nValsalva maneuver (exhaling against a closed glottis)\nStimulating the nasopharynx or glottis (e.g. gargling cold water; upside down is often (reasonably) recommended to route water up into the nasopharynx where is is more likely to cause vagal stimulation)\n\nIf none of these is successful, medications are occasionally used. The oldest and most well-established treatment is chlorpromazine (a.k.a. Thorazine), a first-generation antipsychotic. Although it is approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment of hiccups, even that has only been studied in small case series, mostly in patients with hiccups due to cancer. Other medications that are sometimes used off-label include metoclopramide (a.k.a. Reglan) and baclofen. Although the studies of these medications are small, they do appear to be effective.\nMost often, hiccups are benign, often triggered by gastric distention from over-eating or carbonated beverages. However, particularly intractable hiccups have been associated with serious conditions including intracranial problems such as stroke or encephalitis as well as many different kinds of cancer. If hiccups are occurring very frequently or are difficult to resolve, you should consult with a doctor. \n\n\nReferences\n \n\n1. Guelaud C, Similowski T, Bizec JL, Cabane J, Whitelaw WA, Derenne JP.

There are problems with a scant amount of medicine crumbling, as you've noticed.\nThe only real concern I'd have for anyone doing this is regarding the authorities: for example, while traveling out of the country, it's good to keep your medicines in their original prescription bottles because it supports you're assertion that the medicines are all prescribed to you. In my entire life, I had only one border agent question my medications. So even there, it's rare.\nAs long as you can tell which pill is which, this is perfectly safe.\nOne way to decrease crumbling of a pill is to put a piece of cotton in your container, so that when you close it, the pills don't rattle around in your purse. That's the reason many medications come with a cotton ball stuffed into the bottle.\n", "nutrition - Is it better to eat fruit as they are, than to have them in liquid form?": "\nThe simpler story is that it is better to eat whole fruit. \nThe problem with eating smoothies or even drinking fruit juice is that you are increasing the fruit's glycaemic index. For example, an orange has a glycaemic index of 40, while orange juice has a glycaemic index of 501. The theory goes that low glycaemic index foods lower the risk of metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes and there is indeed epidemiological data which confirms this specifically about fruit and fruit juice: \n\nGreater consumption of specific whole fruits, particularly blueberries, grapes, and apples, is significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas greater consumption of fruit juice is associated with a higher risk. \n\nbased on data from 3 studies which followed a total of ~150 000 women and ~35 000 men for 18 to 24 years.2. Note that the consumption of fruit juice increases the diabetes risk when compared to baseline, not just when compared to whole fruit. \nSeeing that the average person in a Western culture has a higher chance of developing a metabolic disorder than of having difficulties digesting cellulose, we can conclude that, ceteris paribus, fruit is healthier for you than fruit juice. I did not find data on smoothies and purees, they should fall between whole fruit and fruit juice in glycaemic index. \nThe story gets murkier when we consider your diet as a whole. People are unlikely to eat a whole orange when they are thirsty. So if you are currently drinking orange juice and planning to switch to the same amount of whole oranges and switch to drinking water, this is probably going to be a healthy decision. But if you are going to switch to drinking Coca cola when thirsty, it will likely be worse. While I did not look for data doing this comparison, the glycaemic index of Coca cola is 631, and it also contributes many calories without them being paired with micronutrients. \nThere has been some debate on whether recommending diets based on GI makes sense, see these two 2002 reviews (paywalled): 3 and 4. Anecdotally, I'd say that they make sense, as I have seen people lose weight on them without complaining of hunger pangs. \n\n1 http://www.health.harvard.edu/healthy-eating/glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods\n2 http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.f5001\n3 http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1467-789X.2002.00079.x\n4 http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1467-789X.2002.00080.x\n", "productivity - Reversing sleep cycle": "\nThere are quite a few things you can do to \"reset\" your sleep schedule, as shown by this WebMD article. However, be aware that due to your own circadian rhythms, that may not be the optimal pattern for you. Some of the suggestions include:\n\nBright lights - Use bright lights around you when you first get up.\nDim lights - Conversely, use dim lights in the evening.\nDon't lay awake - If you tend to lay awake for a while, do something else before you go to bed.\nTime meals - Use your meal times to help your body adapt to when to sleep. If you eat at irregular times, it can throw off your body.\nLimit caffeine intake (Especially later in the day)\n\nThere are a few other suggestions in the article, especially relating to travel. One of the other suggestions is supplementing with melatonin, but as can be seen by this study review, many of the studies are not very well done, and a few directly refute melatonin being a sleep aid.\nIf you have trouble adjusting to a more traditional sleep schedule, you may want to look at biphasic sleeping (2, 4 hour sleep shifts) or contact a sleep center for help.\n", "nutrition - What are the most likely essential amino acids to be deficient in a vegan diet?": "\nA vegan diet is based only on vegetal foods. If we analyze the amino acid content of different food protein sources (animal and plant proteins),  lysine is consistently at a much lower concentration in all major plant-food protein groups than in animal foods (1, 2). Lysine is one of the essential amino acids, thus lysine is most likely to be the first limiting amino acid in diets that are based\npredominantly on cereal grains (2).\nFor this reason the American Dietetic Association, in its 2009 position paper on vegetarian diets, recommends an increase of consumption of beans and soy products in order to satisfy the essential amino acids requirements in vegan diets (3).\n", "dermatology - Can Neem Leaves be taken directly (Azadirachta indica, Nimtree)": "\nFirst of all, I would suggest doing extensive research into natural-remedies and be extremely cautious.\nI understand that your original question was referring to the method, however I believe this information is relevant, as there are factors to take into account that suggest the method of direct ingestion may not be safe. Ultimately, you should contact a professional.\nThere is not enough scientific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for neem. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult your pharmacist or physician or other healthcare professional before using.\nWebMD, not always accurate, does specify that Neem is taken orally, though it doesn't indicate what form (powder, leaf, pill, etc.). It has the following warnings and precautions about Neem in general:\n\n\nOverview Neem is POSSIBLY SAFE for most adults when taken by\n  mouth for up to 10 weeks, when applied inside the mouth for up to 6\n  weeks, or when applied to the skin for up to 2 weeks. When neem is\n  taken in large doses or for long periods of time, it is POSSIBLY\n  UNSAFE. It might harm the kidneys and liver.\nChildren\nTaking neem seeds or oil by mouth is LIKELY UNSAFE for children. Serious side effects in infants and small children can happen within hours after taking neem oil. These serious side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness, blood disorders, seizures,\n  loss of consciousness, coma, brain disorders, and death.\nPregnancy/Breast-Feeding Neem oil and neem bark are LIKELY\n  UNSAFE when taken by mouth during pregnancy. They can cause a\n  miscarriage.\nNot enough is known about the safety of need during breast-feeding.\n  Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\nAuto-immune diseases Multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic\n  lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other similar\n  conditions: Neem may cause the immune system to become more active,\n  possibly increasing the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you\n  have one of these conditions, it\u2019s best to avoid using neem.\nDiabetes There is some evidence that neem can lower blood\n  sugar levels and might cause blood sugar to go too low. If you have\n  diabetes and use neem, monitor your blood sugar carefully. It might\n  be necessary to change the dose of your diabetes medication.\nInfertility There is some evidence that neem can harm sperm.\n  It might also reduce fertility in other ways. If you are trying to\n  have children, avoid using neem.\nOrgan Transplant and Surgery There is a concern that neem\n  might decrease the effectiveness of medications that are used to\n  prevent organ rejection. Do not use neem if you have had an organ\n  transplant. \nNeem might also lower blood sugar levels as mentioned earlier. There\n  is a concern that it might interfere with blood sugar control during\n  and after surgery. Stop using neem at least 2 weeks before a\n  scheduled surgery.\n\nIt would be safer to avoid direct leaf intake for children, the pregnant, and those trying to have a baby as well as those who have recently had a transplant.\nhttp://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-577-neem.aspx?activeingredientid=577&activeingredientname=neem\n", "dentistry - Can white grease help your teeth?": "\nOil-Pulling\n\nOil pulling is an ancient Ayurvedic practice that essentially involves\n  swishing around oil in the mouth. Similar to a mouthwash, the oil\n  \u201cpulls\u201d bacteria and toxins out of the mouth and, over time, can leave\n  your teeth whiter and your gums healthier. And while oil pulling may\n  seem a little \u201cwoo woo\u201d at first, many studies have proven that the\n  practice can be extremely beneficial to oral health and hygiene.]1\n\nI wouldn't use \"never\" as it's an absolute that usually doesn't work, yet there are some indications that oils may have certain oral health benefits such as alleviating halitosis (bad breath), and reducing gingivitis (inflammation of the gums).\nWhite Grease\nWhite grease is basically inedible pig fat used as lubricant in mechanics. The studies mentioned test traditional Indian folk remedies that rely on sesame or sunflower oil, but there doesn't seem to be much indication if any about white grease.\nDecreasing the amount of bacteria in the mouth could contribute to less cavities, though there's no certainty of either effect in white grease.\nAccording to this safety data sheet on White Lithium Grease, \n\n\"INGESTION: Ingestion may cause slight stomach irritation and\n  discomfort.\"\n\nIf you're willing to bear the risks of accidental ingestion (which shouldn't happen anyways if you're using it like mouthwash), then maybe you could find out for yourself.\nSources: \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21911944 \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19336860 \nhttp://www.panef.com/pdf/MSDS%20WGA-6.pdf\n", "diet - What's wrong with fish canned in oil?": "\nThis is most likely referring to the fact that canned fish is often packed in vegetable oils, which add fat content while not providing the omega-3 content of fish oil.\n", "nutrition - Nutritionally speaking, are food volumes calculated pre- or post-preparation?": "\nIn the US, 21 CFR 101 provides reference amounts for serving sizes, which are usually followed somewhat closely (I wasn't able to determine if they are required by law) by food manufacturers.\nIn the specific case of rice, the standard serving size is \"140 g prepared; 45 g dry\" listed in the format \"_ cup(s) (_ g)\".\nUsually, the nutritional label on the actual product package (no comment on databases on random websites and apps) will provide information about whether it is referring to prepared or \"raw\" state, or will provide both. The prepared state may include ingredients not provided in the package.\nFor example, Cheerios has a serving size of \"1 cup (28 g)\", dry, and additionally provides a column with values for \"with 1/2 cup skim milk\".\nKraft Macaroni & Cheese Dinner gives the serving size as \"2.5 oz (70 g / about 1/2 box) (Makes about 1 cup)\", and provides columns for \"as packaged\" and \"as prepared\". Different pictures I found of the nutrition information and directions varied widely as to the calories of the \"as prepared\" column and the amount of butter called for; presumably these will match on any given box.\nI wasn't able to find any pictures of real nutrition labels for packages of plain rice.\nGoogle allows you to specify \"raw\" or \"cooked\" when searching for the nutrition information of rice - according to it, 100 grams of cooked long-grain brown rice has 111 calories, and 100 grams of raw long-grain brown rice has 370 calories. When the measure is switched to one cup, the calories are 216 and 684 respectively, with the weights being 195 and 185 grams. So, if your app doesn't say, it should be easy to figure out which numbers track better with how many calories it actually says a cup of rice has.\n", "diabetes - Formula for determining carb count from blood sugar changes?": "\nIf you know your insulin-to-carb ratio and your correction factor (how much your blood sugar drops per unit of insulin), you should be able to calculate how much you should have had fairly simply \u2013 at least in theory. \nAssuming that your blood sugar would have remained level had you not eaten (which will not usually be the case in real life), you just need to subtract your expected blood sugar from your actual blood sugar. \n85 - 200 = 115 [mg/dL]\n\n115 [mg/dL] * (correction factor) [units / mg/dL] = (insulin deficit) [units]\n\nSuppose your correction factor is 1:50, e.g. 1 unit brings you down 50 mg/dL. \n115 [mg/dL] * (1/50) [units / mg/dL] = 2.3 [units]\n\nYou can then estimate about how many extra carbs were in the meal, using your insulin-to-carb ratio: \n(insulin deficit) [units] * (carb ratio) [g carb/unit] = (excess carbs) [g carb]\n\nSuppose your ratio is 1:10, e.g. 1 unit covers 10g of carb: \n2.3 [units extra needed] * 10 [g carb/unit] = 23 [g carb more than estimated]\n\nIf you use 15g carb = 1 exchange/choice: \n23 g / 15 g = 1.5 exch\n\nSo, you now know that the meal had 23g more carb in it than you expected, and that in the future you would take 2.3 more units. \nOf course, in reality it's not quite so simple. Different foods take longer to digest, convert to glucose, and enter the bloodstream. Activity level, injection site, and other factors affect how quickly insulin kicks in. The above calculation is the most straightforward way to calculate the food/insulin/blood sugar balance, but there will always be other factors at play. \n", "dermatology - Itchy miscolored inflammed bump on elbow": "\nA proper diagnosis would require more questions for your particular situation.  For example:\n - Do you have, or have you had, a fever since you noticed this bump? \n - Do you any other skin reactions anywhere else on your body? \n - Did you have any scratches or broken surface of the skin in the area of the bump before you noticed it and the swelling started? \n - Do you know of insects, ticks, or spiders that may be common in your area? If so, do you feel you may have been exposed to these?\nIt appears one possibility is a localized reaction resulting from an insect bite. The symptoms you are noticing are common after an arthropod bite, such as local discomfort or pain; pruritis (itchiness); and erythema (redness). Because there is blanching in the center with a ring of erythema around this, it may suggest a bite.\nAnother less likely possibility is cellulitis. Cellulitis is an infection of the skin and subcutaneous layer of tissue just below the skin. This can result from trauma to the skin such as a cut or a bite, when bacteria are able to enter through the disturbed skin surface. However, accompanying symptoms also include tenderness/pain at the site; chills; fever; and swollen lymph nodes near the site.\nIbuprofen (e.g. Motrin) taken orally should help decrease inflammation around the site of the swelling, thereby alleviating some of the itching and discomfort. The topical corticosteroids available over the counter may not be in the strength you need to counter an inflammatory or allergic reaction.  Due to this, it would be prudent to consult your health care provider if this does not start to resolve within the next 24 hours as it sometimes may two to three days for the initial symptoms to subside if this resulted from a bite. Also, if you develop other symptoms such as fever, nausea, decreased appetite, fatigue, or hives you should see your provider right away.\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/insectbitesandstings.html\nhttp://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-and-soft-tissue-infection-cellulitis-beyond-the-basics?view=print\n", "nutrition - Detriments to Soylent fad?": "\nI think the biggest issue (already mentioned by Joshua Frank) is our flawed understanding of how nutrition interacts with human health, especially for the long term. If nutrition were as easy as Soylent claims, well, we could take a multivitamin and eat ice cream for the rest of our lives, no problem. But what do you know, it's more complicated than that. We're constantly discovering new nutrients or new roles for nutrients we already knew about. We now know from microbiome- and psychology- related research that we are not simply the sum of what we eat, but also why we eat and how we eat.\nYou probably won't die from consuming Soylent (people eat more terrible things all the time), but I wouldn't consider it any healthier than, say, Wonderbread with a multivitamin chaser. In the end, I merely consider it another addition to our supermarkets full of highly processed food.\nAnd dude - it's made of people. Gross.\n", "infection - Do I have to wait after a tick bite to get vaccinated for encephalitis?": "\nWaiting period\nIt's hard to prove some information doesn't exist, but maybe I'll get points for effort ;)\nThere is a section on \"Post exposure vaccination\" in the (long) World Health Organization Background Document on Vaccines and Vaccination\nagainst Tick-borne Encephalitis (TBE). They mention the concern you also cite in your question, but go on to say that there is no evidence for it:\n\nOf special concern is the theoretical possibility that post-exposure\n  prophylaxis could result in antibody-dependent enhancement of the infection and exacerbation of the disease. Such phenomena have been reported for other flavivirus infections, but not for TBEV.\n\nAt least, vaccination after exposure will probably not fast enough to prevent an infection (vaccinating after exposure is, for example, done for rabies):\n\nSince TBE has a relatively short incubation period, even an anamnestic response may not be fast enough to protect the individual following exposure.\n\nThis information all seems to come from the review After a tick bite in a tick-borne encephalitis virus endemic area: Current positions about post-exposure treatment. It is also repeated in the WHO position paper Vaccines against tick-borne encephalitis. \nNeither those studies nor the manufacturer information for FSME Immun (which might be what you would receive - warning for others: that information is in German) state a waiting period. A good guess would probably be the incubation period for TBE (median 8 days).\nSubsequent vaccinations\nThat part is easier. For the two vaccines usually used in Western Europe, the WHO writes\n\nWith both vaccines the manufacturers recommend a booster 3 years after completion of the primary series and subsequent boosters at intervals of 5 years (3 year intervals for individuals aged >60 years)\n\nSee table 6 on page 43 of the Background Document on Vaccines and Vaccination against Tick-borne Encephalitis (TBE)\nAs for scheduling, even after those 3 or 5 years, protection is still really good (after 8 years, 90% were still protected), so there's probably no rush and the booster can be taken when convenient.\n", "stomach - Probiotic: capsule or powder?": "\nI cannot answer your question directly, but explaining some general considerations might help to clarify what would be a sound choosing approach.\nWhen you say:\n\nIn my opinion it is better to use capsule since it will protect the bacteria from the acid environment in the stomach.\n\nbear in mind that this applies to gastro-resistant capsules only:\n\nGastro-resistant capsules are delayed-release capsules\n  that are intended to resist the gastric fluid and to release\n  their active substance or substances in the intestinal fluid.\n  Usually they are prepared by filling capsules with granules\n  or with particles covered with a gastro-resistant coating or\n  in certain cases, by providing hard or soft capsules with a\n  gastro-resistant shell (enteric capsules). (Ph.Eur.5.0.)\n\nMany manufacturers of probiotics use hard (gelatine) capsules which are not resistant to stomach acid. In fact these two sorts of capsules have to comply with different pharmacopoeial requirements: \nGastro-resistant capsules:\n\nDisintegration. For capsules with a gastro-resistant shell carry out the test for disintegration [...] use 0.1 M hydrochloric acid as the liquid\n  medium and operate the apparatus for 2 h, or other such time as may be authorised, without the discs. Examine the state of the capsules.The time of resistance to the acid medium varies according to the formulation of the capsules to be examined. It is typically 2 h to 3 h but even with authorised deviations it must not be less than 1 h. No capsule shows signs of disintegration or rupture permitting the escape of the contents. (Ph.Eur.5.0)\n\nWhereas for hard capsules it says:\n\nUse water R as the liquid medium. When justified and authorised, 0.1 M hydrochloric acid or artificial gastric juice R may be used as the liquid medium. [...] Operate the apparatus for 30 min, unless otherwise justified and authorised and examine the state of the capsules. The capsules comply with\n  the test if all 6 have disintegrated. (Ph.Eur.5.0)\n\nSome strains of probiotics are found to be acid resistant which can be enhanced by formulation factors other than gastro-resistant coating. On the other hand, manufacturers of probiotics in gastro-resistant capsules often state (on their websites e.g.) that they deliver more units of probiotic bacteria to the intestines than conventional dosage forms. (It may depend on the strains they use.) Some probiotics can be found in yoghourt which is definitely not gastro-resistant. \nRegulatory requirements are much stricter for medicines than for supplements in most countries, so if one is concerned with the sufficient drug delivery and the accuracy of medical claims, it is useful to know that for medicines to be approved for marketing much firmer evidence about these (and other concerns) has to be submitted.\n\nWhy does powder exist as a dosage form? There may be several reasons to produce and market oral powder as a dosage form: some people have difficulties to swallow capsules, it may depend on manufacturer's production line, powders allow for individualised dosage (measuring the dose for a specific patient - but I don't think this would be necessary with probiotics), hygroscopic excipients which are incompatible with capsule shell etc. \nThe dose you take in powder is not more precise - even if it is sold in divided doses (each dose in one bag), because a small amount of powder can always remain on the walls. The precision of measurement is the same at best, if not in favour of the capsules.\nHow to chose?\nHere are some of the questions that should be taken into account:\n\nIs the patient allergic/intolerant to any of the formulation's ingredients?\nIs there a form preferred by the patient's physician, for some medical reason?\nWhich form is the most convenient one for you?\nWhich form is accessible and affordable to you?\n\n", "toothbrush - Is brushing teeth without toothpaste actually harmful?": "\nMy short answer is : Brushing your tooth without toothpaste will not cause a greater amount of micro-scratches than if you were to use toothpaste. \nTo begin, tooth paste, is a product most often made of abrasive substances that increases the scrubbing power of the toothbrush bristles. Some kinds of toothpaste can also accomplish other things, such as reducing dental sensitivity (potassium nitrate, Sensodyne\u00ae) or make teeth more resistant to caries and acidity (Fluoride).\nIn other words it is the physical movement of the bristles of the brush that removes plaque that accumulates on and between the teeth and gums.\nTherefore, it is not the tooth paste that will make the greatest impact on your teeth and gums but the way you move your toothbrush on the surfaces of your teeth and gums.\nIf you brush too aggressively, you will at first cause the gums to recede and then will use prematurely the enamel on your teeth.\nHere is a list of things to do to brush properly:\n\nBrush your teeth by using the modified Bass (roll-brush) method. Keep your toothbrush at a 45\u00ba angle and make small circular movements, on a set of 2-3 teeth at a time. Avoid broad, horizontal, back-and-fourth movements, since they will irritate the gums. Once a set of teeth has been brushed, make one sweep from the gum to the teeth, to remove any debris stuck in between.\nDon't put too much pressure, and use a soft or super-soft bristle toothbrush. If done correctly, the plaque and bio-film will be removed by the movement of the toothbrush bristles. Anything that is harder than what a soft bristle can remove is probably tarter (calcified plaque) which needs to get removed by a dentist or hygienist.\nIf you need to remove food stuck between teeth, use floss.\n\nA more in-depth look into mechanical plaque control could be done, but it would be somewhat outside the scope of the original question.\nOne of my references:\nhttp://www.aapd.org/assets/1/25/Axelsson-03-S1.pdf\n", "pain - Why does my throat hurt so bad after a bug goes into it?": "\nNo one can diagnose your particular problem over the internet, nor should they. However, some general guidelines may be helpful.\nSwallowing the average gnat should be completely painless, as should swallowing the average mosquito, as neither should be releasing any (or many) noxious chemicals to irritate one's oropharynx.\nSome insects when swallowed do sting defensively, and can cause significant problems; I would include spiders and hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants, etc.) in this group.\nSome insects (such as blister beetles, hairy spiders such as tarantulas, and certain hairy caterpillars, among others) have irritating toxins on them which can cause significant problems with swallowing (tarantula is considered a delicacy in some parts of the world, and this has caused such problems.)\nHowever, to the average person, mosquitoes and gnats should not present much of a problem. It's possible that if someone is extremely hypersensitive to mosquito saliva, the small amount of saliva which might be released by swallowing/crushing the mosquito may irritate one's throat slightly. However, a more likely cause of minor irritation is hypervigillance: the anxiety caused by a threat to one's health can cause an enhanced state of sensory sensitivity. In other words, if someone is anxious that something might hurt them, they might feel something that they might not otherwise pay much attention to, making it worse.\nPharyngeal Irritation After Eating Cooked Tarantula <- beware, yuk-inducing\nSevere tongue necrosis associated with pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea wilkinsoni) ingestion in three dogs\nCaterpillars: An unusual source of ingestion.\nUrticating Hairs in Arthropods: Their Nature and Medical Significance\nPhysician's Guide to Arthropods of Medical Importance, Sixth Edition, Jerome Goddard, CRC Press \n", "diabetes - Can diabetics consume honey?": "\nHoney is rich in glucose (31%) and contains other insulin-triggering sugars such as sucrose and maltose. One study found that it has a glycaemic index of 87, much higher than that of table sugar (59), but note that GI is rather fickle to measure and you can probably find differing numbers for both. I've seen sources (not peer reviewed) which claim that honey's GI is somewhat lower than that of sugar. \nA diabetic can consume honey just like any other carbohydrate. He will have to adjust the amount of honey and other carbohydrates in the same meal such that his blood sugar does not overshoot the target amount. If he is insulin-dependent, he will have received guidelines how to adjust insulin injections depending on the amount of carbohydrates eaten, and will have to include the amount of honey he consumed in his calculation. \nIf the diabetic is on a low-GI diet, honey may not be allowed by the diet-specific rules. This will be explained by the specialist who prescribed the diet. \n", "dermatology - What is the mechanism of eczema?": "\nTLDR: The pathogenesis of eczema is multifactorial, but broadly follows a process of genetic (or epigenetic, in the case of the early gut microbiome) dysregulation relating to barrier integrity proteins like filaggrin with corresponding changes in the skin microenvironment's ceramide content. Following these changes in protein structure and function and lipid quantity, the compromised barrier is predisposed to irritation and infection, which leads to an abnormal immunological response as Th2 cells work to resolve inflammatory processes in the skin (it's not clear how B cells participate in the pathogenesis of eczema at this time). \nTreatment options for mild-moderate eczema are generally limited to topical corticosteroids and moisturizing ointments, as well as topical immunomodulators. For more severe disease, patients can pursue phototherapy, oral (and other systemic) immunosuppressants, or, recently, the mAb dupilumab, which targets the Th2-regulated cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. Considering this mAb's efficacy, you might regard eczema as an autoimmune disease with non-immunological predisposing factors.\n\nGenerally speaking, all of the mechanisms you've described participate in the pathogenesis of eczema. As mentioned, atopic dermatitis (eczema) is not completely understood, but a number of factors have been identified as potential targets for clinical interventions. It remains unclear whether eczema is initiated at the skin barrier (\"outside-in\") or by the immune system (\"inside-out\"), as quality evidence supports either hypothesis, but the actual etiology of eczema is likely a complex interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic physiological elements. Collectively, these factors culminate to produce chronic pruritic (itchy) skin inflammation, particularly on flexor surfaces (\"creases\" between joints).\n\n\nIf the cause is a deficiency of ceramide, what causes this cause? \n\n\nCeramide is an interesting subject in the context of eczema. There are 12 ceramide subspecies, the quantities of which are important for the organization of the epidermal barrier. We know that the epidermal barrier is compromised in eczema, and we know that relative ceramide concentrations are different on eczema patients' skin compared to healthy controls, so we say that there is an association between altered ceramide production and eczema, although we're not certain that this 'deficiency' of ceramide is the actual cause of eczema [1].\n\nCeramides are a family of waxy lipid molecules, so exactly which chemical is produced? \n\nFrom [1]: The lipid bilayers of the stratum corneum consist predominantly of three different lipids: ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. The ceramides are further divided into 12 subspecies (ceramides 1\u201312), and are thought to be critical in the organization of the lipid bilayer. The synthesis of the lipids takes place in the stratum granulosum, from where the lipids are delivered to the stratum corneum. The lipids surround the corneocytes, which are flat nucleus\u2010free cells built of keratin filaments and surrounded by cross\u2010linked proteins called the cornified envelope.\n\nIs it because the skin produces another kind of ceramide which has lower quality, or it does not produce enough?\n\nFrom [1]: Comparisons of SC ceramides in healthy skin and atopic dermatitis skin were made by different groups in the 1990s, and showed lower levels of ceramides 1 and 3, as well as a lower ceramide/cholesterol ratio, for non\u2010lesional atopic skin.\n\n\nIf the cause is an abnormal or missing protein, what causes this cause?\n\n\nThe \"key players\" in skin barrier integrity are lipids (like ceramide) and proteins (which are regulated by gene expression). Because of this known relationship, it was long-hypothesized that there was some genetic dysregulation contributing to the compromised barrier integrity in eczema, which was supported by twin studies showing that eczema was highly heritable. In 2006, mutations in the gene encoding filaggrin (FLG) were identified as a primary predisposing factor for eczema [2,3].\n\nWhat protein it is?\n\nFrom [2]: Filaggrin is a key protein that facilitates terminal differentiation of the epidermis and formation of the skin barrier.\nAs it relates to ceramide, from [1]: ...one research group studied atopic dermatitis skin, excluding patients with filaggrin mutations to ensure that the discoveries made were independent of the mutations, and correlated the ceramide composition with the lamellar lipid organization. They found significantly lower levels of ceramide 3 in atopic dermatitis individuals than in healthy controls, as well as a correlation between a low ceramide 3 level and lamellar lipid disorganization, despite the presence of wild\u2010type filaggrin in both groups.\nWe can see from these results that both proteins (filaggrin) and lipids (ceramide) are involved in the pathogenesis of eczema, but they don't appear to be significantly related to one another. It's possible that eczema/atopic dermatitis, as we currently understand it, can actually be broken up into many subphenotypes that have similar presentations (itchy, erythematous skin) but different etiologies, much like cancer and sepsis.\n\nIs that something related to T cells (recognizing antigens) or B cells (producing antibodies)? \n\nAs mentioned above, skin cells (not T cells) are responsible for lipid production, and filaggrin \"facilitates terminal differentiation of the epidermis\" (not lymphocyte development). However, T lymphocytes are involved in eczema, as it is an inflammatory process (which are regulated by these immune cells) [4]. To avoid going down too many rabbit holes, you might familiarize yourself with helper T cells and cytokines before continuing. From [4]: ...a subgroup of patients with atopic dermatitis has a filaggrin loss-of-function mutation. Recently, it was shown that filaggrin expression is reduced in atopic dermatitis even in the absence of any mutation. Keratinocytes differentiated in the presence of IL- 4 and IL-13 exhibited significantly reduced filaggrin gene expression and neutralization of IL-4 and IL-13 improves skin barrier integrity. This indicates that Th-2 lymphocytes directly contribute to the skin barrier defect in atopic dermatitis...Microscopic studies revealed a sparse perivascular T cell infiltrate in unaffected atopic dermatitis skin that is not seen in normal healthy skin.\nIn terms of B cells, conflicting evidence exists regarding their participation in eczema's pathogenesis. Some patients have shown dramatic improvement in their symptoms when treated with rituximab, an anti-B cell mAb [5], while others have not responded to the medication [6], marking the need for a formal RCT examining rituximab's efficacy in treating eczema and further studies elucidating the role of B cells in the pathogenesis of the disease.\n\nIs it a skin problem or an immune system problem?\n\nThis is really asking \"is eczema an outside-in or an inside-out problem?\" The answer, as I'm sure you've already realized, is: it's more complicated than that. The \"problem\" of eczema arises from disrupted skin permeability, which can be both caused and worsened by a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors [7]:\n\n\n\nAlso, I heard from many sources that this is an immune system problem. And the source of this problem is the gut. They quote Hippocrates: \"All disease begins in the gut\". Is that true? \n\n\nIt's true that studies have shown an association between reduced gut microbial diversity in early life and eczema, but best evidence doesn't support that the gut microbiome plays a definitively causative part in the pathogenesis of the disease [8].\nFrom [8]: Culture-based studies have shown strong associations between cutaneous Staphylococcus aureus colonisation and established atopic eczema during and outside of the context of disease flares. Using the same approach, there is also evidence for an inverse relationship between gut bacterial diversity in early life and the later development of atopic eczema, in keeping with the \u2018biodiversity hypothesis\u2019...both Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis proliferate whilst bacterial diversity drops at lesional sites when atopic eczema flares, but S. aureus elimination is not the main reason why atopic eczema gets better...studies have not found evidence that S. aureus colonisation triggers atopic eczema development...\nBecause eczema is an inflammatory disorder, the immune system is an inherent participant in its initiation and resolution. Recent research has identified Th2 cells as important players in the pathogenesis of eczema [9]. From [9]: Early models of aetiology attributed symptoms of [eczema] to cutaneous inflammation at lesion sites, but recent studies have established that activated immune mediators in the circulation drive disease severity. Activation of T helper 2 (Th2) and Th22 cells in the circulation appears to be the principal initiator of acute [eczema] pathology, with the emergence of Th1 and Th17/interleukin (IL)\u201023 pathway activation marking the transition to a chronic state.\n\nWill just eating healthy food, adding more probiotics, and applying moisturizer help the skin effectively?\n\n\"Healthy food\" won't necessarily help, but avoiding food that contains allergens that trigger your eczema outbreaks will. Besides, eating healthier will make you feel better in general. \"More probiotics\" almost certainly won't help, as clarified by [8]: ...there is further evidence that a reduced diversity of the faecal microbiota precedes the development of atopic eczema, an association that appears lost in established disease. If \"established disease\" doesn't feature the same reduced diversity in the fecal microbiome as before the development of eczema, then the microbiome in established disease isn't really a therapeutic target. \n\"Applying moisturizer\" probably will help. From [7]: Application of creams and ointments containing lipids and lipid-like substances, hydrocarbons, fatty acids, cholesterol esters and triglycerides stimulates barrier repair and increases stratum corneum hydration...As AD is often accompanied by reduced lipid composition, topical application of lipids and hydrocarbons may partially correct permeability barrier defects. It has been shown that topical treatment with hydrocortisone ointments may lead to rapid improvement in barrier function in atopic skin...several research groups and companies report that creams containing ceramides and a mixture of the three key lipids are not superior to \u2018\u2018classical\u2019\u2019 cream or ointment preparations, such preparations have not yet been widely used. More research is necessary to determine the significance of ceramides and the treatment composition with the most therapeutic benefit.\nThe pathogenesis of eczema is multifactorial, but broadly follows a process of genetic (or epigenetic, in the case of the early gut microbiome) dysregulation relating to barrier integrity proteins like filaggrin with corresponding changes in the skin microenvironment's ceramide content. Following these changes in protein structure and function and lipid quantity, the compromised barrier is predisposed to irritation and infection, which leads to an abnormal immunological response as Th2 cells work to resolve inflammatory processes in the skin (it's not clear how B cells participate in the pathogenesis of eczema at this time). \nTreatment options for mild-moderate eczema are generally limited to topical corticosteroids and moisturizing ointments, as well as topical immunomodulators. For more severe disease, patients can pursue phototherapy, oral (and other systemic) immunosuppressants, or, recently, the mAb dupilumab, which targets the Th2-regulated cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 [10]. Considering this mAb's efficacy, you might regard eczema as an autoimmune disease with non-immunological predisposing factors.\n\n[1] Jungersted, J. M. and Agner, T.

This is a condition called Oral Allergy Syndrome, also known as Pollen-Food Allergy Syndrome.1 This is caused by a reaction to foods that contain similar ingredients or proteins to the type of pollen they are allergic to. So while this allergy is a bit different than just a regular pollen allergy, it is likely that, if you have a pollen allergy, there will be foods that trigger the same symptoms you may get from your pollen allergies.2\nThere are a few common types of pollen allergies that have foods associated with them. Ragweed allergy, which is caused by the pollen of ragweed and mainly causes symptoms like sneezing, itchy throat, stuffy/runny nose, and possible trouble breathing. Some of the foods that may cause these symptoms include watermelons, cantaloupes, bananas, and honey.3\nA birch pollen allergy is also a common allergy which has many symptoms similar to those of ragweed allergy. Foods which many trigger those symptoms are kiwi, pears, apples, plums, cherries, carrots, and almonds. Grass pollen allergy is the other common type of pollen allergy and its symptoms, which are also like ragweed and birch allergy symptoms, can be triggered by foods like tomatoes, celery, peaches, and oranges. To help avoid the above mentioned foods, you can try many things, such as cooking the food or peeling it, if it is possible.4\n\n1: Oral Allergy Syndrome\n2: Recognizing pollen food allergy syndrome\n3: Rag Weed Allergy\n4: Foods That May Worsen Pollen Allergies\n", "disease transmission - What is the likelihood of contracting genital HSV1 through oral sex?": "\nIt seems to me that you are looking for solid risk numbers, which I am afraid might not be available. This is just a summary of the basic facts that play into this likelihood. \n\nFor example, what is the likelihood when the partner is asymptomatic vs symptomatic\n\nSo-called \"asymptomatic shedding\", when the virus can be transmitted despite the carrier not showing any sores, is very common in both herpes types. \nA good article on this is Asymptomatic Shedding of Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2: Implications for Prevention of Transmission. It gives an overview over several studies, for example one where 144 heterosexual couples where only one partner was infected were tracked. \n\nTransmission occurred in 14 (9.7%) of the couples, including 13 in which diaries were maintained during the period when transmission occurred. Although 4 couples (31%) reported sexual contact during the prodrome (1 case) or within hours before lesions were first noted by the symptomatic partner (3 cases), in 9 cases (69%) transmission resulted from sexual contact when the source partner reported no symptoms or lesions\n\nPCR studies found that over 80 percent of people showed asymptomatic shedding, on around 20 percent of the days. \nSo the likelihood probably wouldn't dramatically decrease just because the infected partner is asymptomatic. \nHSV1 in the genital region is becoming more common. It is responsible for between 20 and 40 percent of genital herpes. Part of that increase might be from oral sex, but there is no single likelihood figure that can be attributed to a single instance of unprotected oral sex, at least that I can find. \n\nwhat is the likelihood if the person contracting it has already been exposed to oral HSV1 as a child?\n\nIt's possible. Again, we can't really attach a number to that risk. Even people with genital HSV-1 can be infected with another strain of HSV-1 genitally, afterwards being infected twice. \n\nWhereas the sequential HSV-1 isolates in 11 of the 13 patients studied had the same genotypes, the sequential isolates of 2 patients showed a different genotype. The data suggest that HSV-1-induced recurrent genital herpes can be associated with genital reinfection with an exogenous HSV-1 strain.\n\nSmall sample size, but we only care that it's possible at all here. \n\nIf genital HSV1 is contracted, how long does it usually take to find out? (when would symptoms start to appear)\n\nThis varies, not just by a lot of time, but it even varies whether people ever show symptoms. The incubation period is a few days, but around one third of patients may not show symptoms at all. Even more may not recognize them as a herpes infection. HSV-1 also recurs less often after the first outbreak. This leads to a lot of people not even knowing they are infected. Combined with the asymptomatic shedding of the virus, this leads to HSV being a rather prevalent disease. And not even serological testing is over 90 percent certain to detect an infection. The CDC does recommend that patients who have probably been exposed should be tested, though. \n(The part of this answer about asymptomatic shedding is taken from an answer written by me to another question What STDs can be transmitted if both parties have no open sores/cuts ) \n", "pain - Difference between TENS and EMS electro stimulation?": "\nAs you read, both TENS and EMS employ electrotherapy to treat acute and chronic pain, but the methodology differs. (Note that some of the references are to NMES, which stands for Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation, and is considered synonymous with EMS.)\nTranscutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulators (TENS) use electrotherapy to stimulate the nerves and active therapeutic healing. Electronic Muscle Stimulators (EMS), on the other hand, sends electric impulses that cause muscle contraction. EMS units are used to prevent atrophied muscles, for retraining muscles (e.g. in partial paralysis), to increase range of motion, and other uses.\nSome of the technology is described here.\n\nA TENS unit uses microcurrent to increase the production of ATP, which is adenosine triphosphate and the substance that supplies energy to the body on a cellular level. Although lasting pain reduction may require regular microcurrent sessions, in some individuals the pain reduction begins to last longer and the time between sessions lengthens. This may be due to the increased circulatory action that enables the lymph system to begin clearing the body of accumulated toxins. The sensations of both the microcurrent and conventional TENS treatments are more like tingling sensations than the unpleasant feeling of a small electrical shock.\nEMS uses a cycle of stimulation, contraction and then relaxation, to increase blood flow to the area, which decreases inflammation and promotes healing and muscle growth. By stimulating the muscles at their basic structure, an EMS unit causes muscle contractions similar to those obtained by exercise. The EMS units are specifically used to prevent atrophied muscles or for retraining muscles, such as in an individual who has been paralyzed or partially paralyzed. In addition, EMS is used for many other applications such as range of motion improvement, increased circulatory action and the prevention of blood clots.\n\nBoth types of therapies are convenient, in that they're used at home, and the patient controls the dose, generally by way of either a knob or a switch. Electrodes are user-replaceable, though placement instructions are given and monitored by a physician or physical therapist. TENS units also have a \"burst\" feature, enabling the patient intermittent increases, which is helpful after strenuous activity or if you're just having a bad day. I personally found that feature very helpful!\nA Yale University study entitled Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation for Skeletal Muscle Function(Yale J Biol Med. 2012) discussing electrical stimulation (ES), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and functional electrical stimulation (FES) states that the potential that electrical stimulation holds for rehabilitation recovery is immeasurable. It is used to improve muscle strength, increase range of motion, reduce edema, decrease atrophy, heal tissue, and decrease pain.\n\nNeuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), used interchangeably with electrical stimulation (ES), is typically provided at higher frequencies (20-50 Hz) expressly to produce muscle tetany and contraction that can be used for \u201cfunctional\u201d purposes and can be found in literature as early as 1964. TENS is an alternate form of electrical stimulation that historically used high frequencies for pain relief but is now also administered at very low frequencies (sensory level TENS, 2-10 Hz). TENS propagates along smaller afferent sensory fibers specifically to override pain impulses. When very low frequencies are used, TENS specifically targets sensory nerve fibers and does not activate motor fibers; therefore, no discernible muscle contraction is produced.\n\nThis source also has chapters on other subjects pertinent to your question, including, among others:\n\nParameters of electrical stimulation\nPulse width/duration\nStimulation pulse patterns\nStimulation intensity\nDosing of stimulation\nLimitations of electrical stimulation.\n\nIn addition, you may also be interested in the following charts:\n\nFor EMS, this describes in detail which muscles are targeted by names, and at which frequencies.\n\nThis\nshows placement of electrodes of TENS unit, based on the location of the pain.\n\n\nFor further information, including uses, cautions and case studies, see:\nTranscutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation\nEffects of Three Recovery Protocols on Range of Motion, Heart Rate, Rating of Perceived Exertion, and Blood Lactate in Baseball Pitchers During a Simulate Game.\nSerratus muscle stimulation effectively treats notalgia paresthetica caused by long thoracic nerve dysfunction: a case series\nUnderstanding the Differences Between TENS and EMS Units\nHow Does A Tens Unit Work?\n", "virus - What happens to HIV once it completely destroys the immune system?": "\nThis is a very interesting question. It's also highly speculative, and vague (what does \"a doctor... gives them any medicine necessary to protect them from other diseases that might be lurking in their body\" mean? Does it mean they treat the symptoms of AIDS (weight loss, diarrhea, etc?) If it does, then the difference between not treating HIV but treating every complication stretches this almost to the point of meaninglessness. If you are postulating treating all diseases, then I do believe this is speculative at best and unanswerable.\nThe most likely scenario is that the patient would eventually die (but don't we all?) How he would die is pure speculation.\nUnfortunately, while you can place a patient in a sterile environment,\n\nyou can't sterilize a patient\n\nit's exceedingly difficult to sterilize food\n\nto prevent all possible hospital acquired bacterial infections, they would need a bubble-boy-like unit (very rare and extremely expensive)\n\nyou can't predict if some previously unknown virus dormant in our bodies will be able to express itself. (See @Fomite's comment.)\n\n\nThe fact that you stipulate treatment for everything but the virus that replicates in certain blood cells associated with immunity is almost an aside if you're going to treat all pathogens.\nEvery bacteria and virus he has in his body will go into that sterile environment with him, so it depends what he has going in. When he no longer has enough immune competency to keep these under control, they will take their toll. If you treat him in a sterile environment and give him world-class treatment of all infections (anti-virals would be needed to treat herpesvirus recurrences, like chicken pox and HSV1, HCV, HepBV, or any other number of viruses one can carry, treat the encephalitis that comes with HSV/etc. He has a small chance of possibly outliving the disease, only to die in the 3-5 days after you turn him out, unless you include bone marrow transplant in the treatment as well.\nThe progress of HIV to AIDS is variable. Less than 0.5% of patients never develop any sign whatsoever of the infection except for undeniably positive titers. What if your patient is in this small but not-nonexistent subtype?  Then there are almost everything in between, with fewer patients on the healthy end than the sick end.\nMy best guess: your patient will die of some ultimately unconquerable disease you are treating in the bubble, for example, multi-drug resistant C. diff, Kaposi's sarcoma, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, Toxoplasmosis (Up to 50% of the world's human population is estimated to carry Toxoplasma) liver failure from rampant Epstein-Barr, or some other opportunistic infection from something he carried in there but is either devastating or drug resistant.\nYou're asking if the virus will just \"die\" out, effectively curing the patient. That's kind of like letting the heart and lungs die, but keeping the patient alive on a heart-lung bypass machine. That's not a cure, and upon turning it off, the patient will die.\nAnd that's purely a guess, which, on SE, makes it worthless.\nLong-term Nonprogressive Disease Among Untreated HIV-Infected Individuals: Clinical Implications of Understanding Immune Control of HIV\n", "vegetarianism - Advantages of transition from non-vegetarian to vegetarian": "\nThis is a question that cannot be answered by a simple yes or no.\nAs a vegetarian for health purposes (who was a vegan for 1 year) I say that the human isn't supposed to be vegetarian, but rather an opportunistic omnivore. The fact that we can eat meat doesn't mean we have to.\nMost of people that went from non-vegetarian to vegetarian (no meat, no fish) felt better the following weeks, however the reasons could be numerous and ambiguous:\n\nMaybe they were eating too much meat until they stopped ?\nMaybe the meat they were buying was bad quality meat ?\n\nAnyway, most of meat and fish's nutrients we need to live healthy are proven to be in eggs and milk with enough quantities.\nConcerning the vegans (no eggs, no milk), the most recurrent problem is about the vitamin B12 that is very hardly obtained in vegan food, it can be found in some mushrooms, but in most cases you'll have to eat 4kg of that a day to fulfill your daily needs. It can also be found in some algaes and supplements like spirulina, but in that form it is nearly impossible for the body to be absorbed. Even though you might feel better the first year of veganism, you might be sick later on, even though some vegans never become sick.\nIt also depends of the genes of each person. Some African ethnicities have evolved eating a lot of meat per day and still they remain healthier than most of people from Western countries. On the other hand, most Romans from the antiquity were eating less than 1kg of meat per month.\nI think that the best way to find how being vegetarian is good for you is to try it out by yourself, pay attention at how you feel, and have regular blood tests.\nReference: What Everyone (Especially Vegetarians) Should Know About B12 Deficiency\n", "blood tests - How to detect cancer in general?": "\n\nThus far, more than 20 different tumor markers have been characterized and are in clinical use...

The average half-life of nicotine is about two hours, meaning half is eliminated after two hours. \nSmoking a cigarette takes several minutes, let's say 3. The lowest lethal dose estimates I could find were 30 milligrams; smoking 30 cigarettes, for ingesting 30 milligrams of nicotine, would then take 90 minutes, at which point the body has already gotten rid of some of the nicotine. \nEven at the very conservative estimate of 30 milligrams as a lethal, or at least toxic, dose, smoking likely won't get you there, unless doing it competitively for hours. Even for smoking cigarettes at the same time as using nicotine patches (OCT NRT) the FDA states \n\nThere are no significant safety concerns associated with using more than one OTC NRT at the same time, or using an OTC NRT at the same time as another nicotine-containing product\u2014including a cigarette. \n\nEating cigarettes or drinking e-cigarette liquid  are different stories, though.

Sadly, most studies have been done on full body vibration training, so some of the references I point to may not be specifically about vibration belts, but the mechanisms of each method are basically the same.\nA review of several studies1 on vibration exercise in general, including the use of vibration belts, found that vibration exercise was not very efficient in burning fat. It wasn't found to be very good at promoting weight loss or changing the body composition at all (ie: building muscle). One study did show possible signs that vibration exercise and vibration belts can burn fat, but overall, the rate at which fat is burned at when using a vibration belt or other form of vibration exercise is low. There are some possible benefits of vibration exercise, such as higher oxygen intake. This review did not provide fully conclusive results, though.\nAnother review of many studies on whole-body vibration training2 found similar results, though they did point more in the favor of vibration exercise having benefits. The review states in its conclusion that:\n\n[Whole-body vibration training] appears to be associated with three pathways involved in weight loss: inhibition of adipogenesis and reduction of fat mass, increased energy expenditure, and increase in muscle mass. After analysing the literature, none of the results for the proposed pathways are consistent, and indeed are often contradictory.\n\nThis review shows more positive results than the other review I mentioned that vibration training may promote weight loss, especially when used in conjunction with other exercises meant to help you lose weight. Vibration exercise does appear to be safe, though, so it can be used with a weight loss diet and exercises to help promote weight loss. Though this review was about whole-body vibration training, vibration belts work in a similar fashion, so it is likely that vibration belts may produce similar results.\n\n1: Is vibration exercise a useful addition to a weight management program?\n2: Whole-body vibration training as complement to programs aimed at weight loss\n", "contraception - What health risks are associated with expired condoms?": "\nTL;DR: using expired condom might lead to irritation on the skin of the sex organs involved in the act, and might also lead to skin inflammation and rash.\n\nAfter some self research, I found this article which while not scientific and official, is written by someone who appears to know what they're talking about.\nQuoting the relevant part: (part about pregnancy isn't relevant to my case since the question is purely about health)\n\nHere are some of the common risks linked with using expired condoms:\n...\n\nIrritation: As mentioned earlier, a condom which has crossed its expiration date may get dried and weak. A dried and weak condom can cause irritation on the skin of your sex organ and also in the vagina. It can also lead to skin inflammation and rash.\n\n\n", "prescription - My doctor says he's not qualified to prescribe HRT": "\nMany primary care practitioners have not received training in the evaluation and treatment of patients who are transitioning.\n\nI went to my doctor's office to be prescribed to HRT medications, but my doctor said he's not qualified to prescribe it. Is that possible? \n\nYes, it's possible in that he may not believe he's qualified to prescribe HRT for a transitioning female. Treating transitioning females hormonally is not a common occurrence, and doctors are allowed to refuse to treat conditions they're unfamiliar or (medically) uncomfortable with.\n\nTranssexual patients often have difficulty finding care because many physicians are not comfortable prescribing appropriate hormone regimens. Management of hormones for transsexual patients is not difficult, and these medications are safer than many therapies routinely prescribed by the primary care physician. The diagnosis of gender identity disorder (GID) must be established by an experienced mental health professional prior to consideration for hormonal management.\n\nOnce this has been done, a specialist can easily communicate the treatment regimen to be followed, but it's really up to the individual physician to do so. Most will. Some won't. In that case, a reasonable physician will refer to a colleague who does do so.\nThere should not be any financial repercussions for you. \nClinical Update: Medical Care of Transsexual Patients\n", "orthopedics - What's the difference between a maisonneuve fracture and a Weber C fracture?": "\nThe Maisonneuve fracture is a special form of the Weber C fracture. What makes it special is that the fracture of the fibula has to be localized within the proximal third of the fibula shaft (see \"The Maisonneuve fracture is a spiral fracture of the proximal third of the fibula\", http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23079149). Weber C includes all localizations of the fracture of the fibula.\n", "dentistry - Are chlorhexidine mouthwashes safe?": "\nLike almost all products, there are some side effects that come with using chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash (CGM). Luckily, they are usually very minor and the ones that are more serious are extremely rare. WebMD1 lists some of the common side effects of using CGM, such as teeth and mouth discoloration, taste problems, and an increase of tartar formation in the teeth. There are also more serious side effects that can come from using CGM, but these are mostly allergic reactions to its ingredients and are very rare. The FDA2 has also said that serious allergic allergic reactions can occur from using products with chlorhexidine gluconate.\n\nAnaphylaxis, as well as serious allergic reactions, have been reported during postmarketing use with dental products containing chlorhexidine.\n\nThere are studies that agree with the information that WebMD has said. Many of them are older, but the results of them are still reliable. A 1988 study3 testing out the difference between 0.1% and 0.2% CGM. It found that with both there were possible minor side effects like discoloration and loss of taste. The only noticeable difference between the two is that the test subjects preferred the taste of the 0.1% CGM.\nThere are also two studies from the 1980's4, 5 that suggest that CGM can also cause gingival bleeding. The studies did notice a slight increase in the frequency of gingival bleeding when using CGM as opposed to mechanical oral care.\nThough there are side effects that can occur from using CGM, they are most likely not going to be very severe. Also, it is most likely that the benefits of using CGM will outweigh the risks. A 2006 study on both topical chlorhexidine gluconate and CGM6 found that the topical and mouthrinse both helped treat plaque and prevent gingivitis when used properly.\nOdds are, your dentist told you to use CGM because of the swelling of your gums, a sign of gingivitis. It is more than likely that the benefits of you using CGM will outweigh the risks. If you really are worried about getting bad side effects from CGM, ask your doctor and try to find out if you are allergic to any of the ingredients.\n\n1: WebMD - Chlorhexidine Gluconate Mouthwash Side Effects\n2: PerioChip (chlorhexidine gluconate)\n3: Side-effects and patient acceptance of 0.2% versus 0.1% chlorhexidine used as post-operative prophylactic mouthwash\n4: Gingival bleeding after chlorhexidine mouthrinses\n5: Gingival bleeding after chlorhexidine rinses with or without mechanical oral hygiene\n6: The effect of mouthrinses and topical application of chlorhexidine on the development of dental plaque and gingivitis in man\nchlorhexidine gluconate\nchlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse (Peridex, Periogard, Periochip)\n", "nutrition - Are there any sustainable alternatives to eating food?": "\nThere's Soylent, which is designed for exactly what you describe. \nBut even without considerations of taste, I'm very suspicious of this approach, because it's based on some assumptions that I would question. One is that we know exactly what the human body needs and can just put it in a shake. But what if there are micronutrients in real food that we just haven't discovered yet? Or what if the nutrient in the shake simply doesn't work when distilled into pure form, without the natural packaging provided by, say, the apple it came from. We evolved to eat food, and assuming that we can eat a processed version may be misguided.\n", "brain - Reducing trauma from surgery prohibiting sedation": "\nAmnesia is very important in anesthesiology\nIndeed, this is a concern in the anesthesiology community as well. I recall a friend and former colleague of mine was involved in a project including this paper (in which I had no involvement):\nRaz, A., Eimerl, D., Zaidel, A., Bergman, H., & Israel, Z. (2010). Propofol decreases neuronal population spiking activity in the subthalamic nucleus of Parkinsonian patients. Anesthesia & Analgesia, 111(5), 1285-1289.\n...in which they attempted to characterize brain activity under anesthesia that is normally measured in awake subjects while placing deep brain stimulation electrodes for patients with Parkinson's disease. Usually this procedure, like those you mentioned, requires patients to be awake because the position of the electrodes depends on brain activity. General anesthesia disrupts this brain activity, so it hasn't typically been used.\nThis just a case study, though: it's a general area of interest in anesthesiology to extend general anesthesia to cases where it is normally avoided in order to improve patient comfort.\nSo yes, this is definitely an area of concern and consideration. However, since this is a concern and yet there isn't an ideal agent in use, it's fairly easy to conclude that the answer to:\n\nis there a (simple & magical) way of inducing anterograde amnesia without the mental \"fog\" for trauma reduction in surgery?\n\nis unfortunately no, otherwise it would be in use all the time! However, for at least some procedures, benzodiazepines can help.\nBenzodiazepines promote amnesia and enhance anesthesia\nAs you say, anterograde amnesia is a beneficial \"side effect\" of general anesthesia, but not only that: it is also an intentional effect. Patients expect to not remember their surgeries as well as not be aware in the moment (Rowley et al 2017 is a recent survey of patient attitudes towards anesthesia). Benzodiazepines are sedatives that are often given along with general anesthesia (midazolam, in particular) to both reduce the dose of anesthetic necessary to obtain a desired hyponotic effect and also to improve per-operative amnesia.\nMidazolam is an effective amnestic in moderate doses, and it acts quite quickly (see for example Dundee & Wilson, 1980), helping reduce possibility for traumatic experiences even in the initial preparations for surgery.\nBenzodiazepines as an alternative to general anesthesia\nSome procedures are done with only benzodiazepines as \"conscious sedation\" (often with addition of a narcotic or local anesthetic since benzodiazepines do not provide analgesia), both for the anxiolytic and amnestic effects as well as safety compared to general anesthesia (subanesthetic doses of general anesthetic agents like propofol may be used alternatively or in addition in some cases). Examples include dental procedures, colonoscopies, and endoscopies. Often these procedures can be performed with limited patient memory, especially after 24 hours.\nBenzodiazepines may not be appropriate for all patients or all procedures, of course, and they are certainly sedating even if patients are conscious. However, there is no safe alternative for inducing amnesia without full loss-of-consciousness.\n\nDundee, J. W., & Wilson, D. B. (1980). Amnesic action of midazolam.

What do people expect of general anaesthesia?.\n", "side effects - Low voltage exposure": "\nThere is an adage in electrical safety that \"It is not the voltage that kills you, it is the current\". This was investigated at Skeptics.SE. A review of literature regarding electrocution suggests 0.06 A to 0.07 A is fatal. That said, because of Ohm's law, voltage does play a role. Ohm's law says that V=IR, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.\nThis analysis measured R for the human body under various conditions (dry, damp, and with a metal ring) and calculated the various voltages needed to get lethal currents based on 17 mA across the chest being lethal. With clean dry skin you would need a voltage of 20 kV while with damp skin you need 340 V to kill you. If you are in contact with metal (e.g., wearing a ring), lethal currents can be generated at as low as 17 V. Even in the worst case scenario of a foot immersed in a conductive liquid with a total resistance of 100 Ohm, would mean that you would require 1.7 V to get a lethal current.\nWith a 2V, 30 mA, AC power supply, under the right (or wrong) conditions, you could deliver an immediately lethal shock in excess of 17 mA across the chest. If we assume 100 Ohm is the lowest possible resistance, despite the 30 mA source, we are limited to 20 mA at 2 V. The exact impact of 20 mA will depend on the frequency of the source (AC and DC are different and 60 Hz AC is different from 10 kHz AC). With 20 mA at 60 Hz, you would probably lose voluntary muscle control and have pain (possibly sever) and would probably begin experiencing difficulty breathing.\n", "research - Is it possible to calculating HRV from heart rate alone?": "\nHeart rate variability (HRV) is a measure of the variation in the beat-to-beat interval. The heart rate (HR) is the number of heart beats in some unit time (generally expressed as the number of beats per minute). In general, because measures of HR are an average over time, it will smooth out the variability in the heart rate. The amount of HRV cannot be estimated from a measure of the HR at a single time point. Estimating the amount of HRV from multiple measures of HR at different times is possible, but will be corrupted by changes in the average heart rate over time. So in summary, no HRV cannot be estimated from measures of HR.\n", "dentistry - What leaf resembling a mint numbs toothaches?": "\nI am not sure about the leaf you are asking about. But in India we use Cloves since centuries to soothe toothache.\nIt is a flower bud and very effective against toothaches.\n", "pain - Are there medications that relieve and stop migraines quickly?": "\nAs you alluded to in the question, medications used for migraine headaches generally fall into two categories, prophylactic (meds taken daily to prevent migraines) and abortive (meds taken when a migraine starts in order to stop it). Your question is about the second group.\n\u201cInstantly\u201d (as noted in the comments) is a little absurd; there is obviously some delay between the time of ingestion of the medication and its effect at receptors that provides relief of pain. However, you\u2019re right to note that the time-to-onset of anti-migraine effect is relevant, and this is a case where the available medications do vary in this respect in a way that tempers their usefulness. \nRelevant pharmacology: routes of administration \nMedications taken orally (by mouth) are generally the slowest to onset of action. Intravenous medications, introduced directly into the bloodstream, are generally the fastest. Perhaps less well-known are other methods that are nearly as fast as IV: sublingual, intranasal, and inhaled. In each of these cases, the medication is placed in apposition to blood vessels that are able to absorb it directly. This only works for certain types of medications (mostly lipophilic ones that can cross into blood vessels), but it\u2019s fast and avoids some of the difficulties of oral administration.* Subcutaneous, transdermal or intramuscular administration is generally also somewhat quicker to reach the bloodstream than oral medications.\nMigraines: oral may not be best \nFor reasons that are not fully understood, abortive medications are more effective when used early in the attack, so the quicker routes of administration are also expected to provide relatively more benefit. In addition, migraine headaches are often associated with severe nausea and vomiting which may limit the utility of oral medications. Even when vomiting is not present, migraines are associated with gastric stasis, meaning that the stomach is slow to empty into the duodenum, the part of the gut where medications are generally absorbed.\nAbortive medications for migraines:  \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs): particularly for mild attacks, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and other NSAIDs are all effective. The only NSAID available for non-oral use (at least in the US) is ketorolac, which is effective with IV or IM administration (ASA and ketorolac references given below; others available upon request.)\nTriptans: This class of drugs is the mainstay of abortive treatment for moderate to severe migraines. Triptans are available for a variety of routes of administration. Sumatriptan can be given as a subcutaneous injection (usually via auto-injector in the thigh), as a nasal spray, or orally; a transdermal preparation is planned to be marketed in 2015. Zolmitriptan is available for both nasal and oral use. Non-oral routes of administration tend to be fastest. This pharmacokinetic paper demonstrates that nicely:\n\n\n\nImage from: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4232272/ \u201cPowder\u201d here refers to an intranasal powder preparation.\n \n\nErgots: These vasoconstricting medications have a similar receptor activity as Triptans but carry relatively more risk for those with hypertension and cardiovascular disease so are used less frequently. Dihydroergotamine has somewhat fewer side effects than ergotamine itself and is available for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intranasal use. \n\n\n\nNotes and references\n \n \n*For practical purposes, all three of these routes tend to be not quite as quick as would be expected theoretically because a portion of the drug ends up swallowed and subject to all of the usual constraint of oral administration. \n \n\nKirthi V, Derry S, Moore RA Aspirin with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults.

However, alcohol causes damage to other cells in the body such as in the brain and throat. Since your example is of hard liquor, there would be damage to the mouth and esophagus not present from consumption of more dilute solution. Although beyond the scope of your question, many people would consider changes like habituation to the effects and long-term tolerance, and even \"developing an acquired taste\" which could increase the propensity for alcoholism, to be harmful.\nA study of two hospitalized toddlers found that their alcohol consumption was somewhat under 20 mL for the first one (who drank an acetaminophen elixir) and 2 to 7 mL for the second one (who drank mouthwash and collapsed). So it seems that toddlers are more sensitive to the depressant effect of alcohol than adults per kg of body weight, and that it is feasible for them to drink enough alcohol to suffer respiratory arrest.\nThere is a whole thread on reddit discussing your very question. None of the answers were satisfyingly quantitative, but people pointed out that some pediatric medications contain ethanol (which should make it possible to calculate a \"sanctioned\" dose), that people in France and other places have a history of giving a little alcohol to young children, that ethanol is a metabolite (rum flavoring) or additive (flavoring extracts) in some foods, that it forms spontaneously in sugar-containing foods like juice and that it can form naturally in the intestine. So any of these approaches should make it possible to estimate a \"normal\" exposure of toddlers to ethanol, if not a \"safe\" one.\n", "side effects - What is the time frame of developing adrenal suppression when taking oral corticosteroids?": "\nThis question arises from your (correct) understanding that administration of exogenous (i.e. not produced by the body) glucocorticoids (GCs) can suppress the body\u2019s ability to produce its own GCs in the adrenal glands. In order to understand the answer, a little background is necessary.\nWhy does the body become unable to produce cortisone?\nAs in many endocrine systems, negative feedback maintains homeostasis. Exogenous GCs exert negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (a series of hormones starting in the hypothalamus) that normally stimulates GC production in the adrenals. This negative feedback is almost immediately reversible. However, with extended administration of exogenous GCs, the lack of stimulation via the HPA axis leads to atrophy of the adrenal gland, and it becomes unable to produce the horomone even when the feedback suppression is removed. Your question is, how much exogenous GC is required to produce this effect?\nIt\u2019s a very practical question because it affects how doctors prescribe steroids. If adrenal suppression is expected, they must be tapered slowly. If not, a \u201cburst\u201d can be administered and then immediately stopped. Because it\u2019s such a practical question, people thought to study it quite a while ago, and the relevant literature is mostly pretty old (relative to most biomedical data, at least). (See below.)\nThe time required to achieve suppression depends upon:  \n\nthe dose; \nthe length of time administered; and  \nfactors unique to each patient, probably resulting from (ultimately genetic) differences in their rates of GC metabolism.\n\nWho is likely to be suppressed: some general guidelines\nNot suppressed \n\nGC treatment (any dose) for less than three weeks.   \nTreatment with less than 10 mg total daily dose (prednisone equivalents) for any time period.\n\nSuppressed\n\nOral GC treatment of >20 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent) for >3 weeks  \nAny patient with clinical Cushing\u2019s syndrome (see this answer for description)\n\nUncertain suppression: The degree of suppression in this intermediate group is related to individual metabolism parameters that are not (yet!) established in a way that can be measured and used clinically.  \n\nLess than 20 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent) for >3 weeks.\nAny dose for >3 weeks administered every other day.\n\nThe rule of thumb I learned (which is fairly conservative): >10 mg for >3 weeks requires tapering.  \nIn those patients who fall into the uncertain category, there is something called a \"cosyntropin stimulation test\u201d that helps make the distinction. In this test, a doctor administers a hormone (cosyntropin, a.k.a. ACTH) that stimulates the adrenal gland and measures plasma cortisol concentrations to see if it responds appropriately.\nI\u2019ve been talking in prednisone \u201cequivalents.\u201d There are steroid equivalent converters around. In general, prednisolone and prednisone have a 1:1 dosing relationship. \nThe answer to your question, then, is no. Seven days is a common prescription for a steroid \u201cburst\u201d, and tapering is generally considered to be unnecessary. \n\n\nAckerman GL, Nolsn CM.

Your ointment should have an expiration date. You should not use it past that date. Not just that microbiological quality can't be guaranteed after that much time (not even with phenol which might have preserved it to a point, but not for 40 years), but also the chemical composition might have changed - both the active substances and the excipients might have underwent various chemical reactions - and no one can say with any certainty what you've got in there now.\n\nNow, onto your question: How important is the amount of active ingredient in an ointment?\nIt depends on the ingredient. The concentration is important because both safety and efficacy/effectiveness depend on it. Some ingredients have a very wide range of concentrations in which they are proven to be both safe and effective; others have a very narrow range of concentrations in which they should/(are recommended to) be used; some are somewhere in between. You are asking about an ointment with lesser concentrations of active substance than the one you previously used, so the efficacy of the 'new' ointment is what you are concerned with.\nPhenol\nPhenol is used as an antiseptic in your ointments. The efficacy of antiseptics depends on many factors including:\n\nconcentration\nacidity (pH value) of the solution/medium/preparation\nduration of exposure\nthe type(s) and number of microorganisms present\npresence of organic matter (especially in forming a biofilm)\n\nSo, the concentration is important, but there are other factors to be taken into account.\nAccording to Martindale, The Complete Drug Reference (34th edition), the Phenol monograph:\n\nAqueous solutions up to 1% are bacteriostatic while stronger solutions are bactericidal.\n\nBoth ointments you used contain phenol in bacteriostatic (inhibits growth of bacteria) and not bacteriocidal (kills bacteria) concentrations.\nThere is various research on a MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) of phenol:\nAccording to Antiseptics and Disinfectants: Activity, Action, and Resistance G. McDonnell, A. D. Russell\n\nPulvertaft and Lumb (386) demonstrated that low concentrations of phenols (0.032%, 320 \u03bcg/ml) and other (nonphenolic) agents lysed rapidly growing cultures of E. coli, staphylococci, and streptococci\n\nFrom the same source (based on references 226 and 440 provided in that research paper):\n\nthe MIC of phenol against S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa is 2,000 \u03bcg/ml (which is 0.2%)\n\nIn Protection of bacteria against toxicity of phenol by immobilization in calcium alginate  Heribert Keweloh, Hermann-Josef Heipieper, Hans-J\u00fcrgen Rehm have used solutions of phenol in both 1 g/l (0.1%) and 2 g/l (0.2%) concentrations and got inhibition of growth of some bacteria (although they were testing something else, and I can't access the whole article).\nConclusion: concentration of phenol in your ointment is close to or over the ones I found in these references, and should be sufficient to exibit bacteriostatic activity if other conditions (such as pH, lipophilicity/hydrophilicity of the preparation etc) are favourable.\nZnO\n\nZinc oxide is mildly astringent and is used topically as a soothing and protective application in eczema and slight excoriations, in wounds, and for haemorrhoids (Martindale).\n\nIt is used in concetrations of up to 50% (Deutscher Arzneimittel Codex \u2013 DAC), but technical literature doesn't specify a minimal concentration at which it should be used.\n\n\nPerhaps I could just use more each time?\n\nYou could, but you shouldn't. Follow the instructions included in the patient information leaflet. (Using more most likely wouldn't enhance the efficacy anyway).\n\nIn the end if a product is marketed as a medicine/drug in your country, it has to be submitted to rigorous procedures before it is approved, i.e. authorised for sale.\n\nBefore drug products are authorized for sale in Canada, Health Canada reviews them to assess their safety, efficacy and quality.

The next ingredients are Shea Butter and sunflower seed oil (good for the skin), then a humectant (attracts moisture from the air to the skin), then another surfactant/detergent - very, very mild, then a thickener/foam enhancer (people don't like to wash up with stuff that doesn't make bubbles), then Allantoin, one of my all-time favorite ingredients for skin care, then the rest are in amounts at or under 1% and are mostly to increase shelf life/prevent bacteria from growing in the product.\nIf that doesn't seem like an answer to you, I'll put it in plain English, but first an aside.\nThe Romans (well, maybe limited to the middle class and up), who had soap to wash garments with, did not use soap on their skin. Instead, they bathed in hot water, then were coated with an infused olive oil (say, lavender), then the oil was scraped from their skin with a scraper, taking away the old and (?)foul smelling, and leaving behind some of the nicer, new stuff. A couple of additional steps and they were clean. That was good skin care.\nNo one today washes that way. It would be prohibitively expensive and time consuming. By habit, many people would not feel clean, either, because they equate \"bubbles\" with \"clean\".\nYour Cetaphil is trying to do that - replace oil removed with oil deposited - while still foaming and acting as a wash, which people expect.\n\nIs it because, in general, it still remove your skin oil? Therefore, after all I still need to apply moisturizer. In that case, what is the different to use normal soap and then use moisturizer after that?\n\nFirst, soap and detergent are different things. I'll assume you mean soap.\nA very high quality soap (which you can't buy commercially) will attempt to do the same thing by superfatting the soap using oils with a great skin care profile: Jojoba oil, Macademia Nut oil, Shea butter, Cocoa butter, etc. to the point of almost not foaming (no bubbles). You would find the Cetaphil and the soap would leave you feeling about the same.\nRegualar soap strips the skin of all fats and sweat, dirt, etc. Then you replace the oils stripped with new oils and the other ingredients in your moisturizer.\nDoes it matter? You can answer that yourself. In one scenario, you strip your skin of oils then add them back. In another, you have some good oils on your skin and you add to that. Which sounds healthier for your skin?\nIf you wonder why I am so opinionated on the matter, it's because I used to make skin care products for health care professionals, who often developed nasty hand dermatitis from hospital supplied skin cleansers. When my husband developed a rash that wouldn't go away - winter or summer, on vacation, using other soaps, etc., - and under a dermatologist's care for two years, biopsied twice and using steroids and other topical meds, I decided I could do better. I learned everything I could about skin health, and made some wonderful soaps and lotions that cured my husband's and others' dermatological problems. I studied skin care for about six years, and made products for five, always improving my formulas. In that very narrow area, I'd pit my knowledge against any but the best dermatologist's. In every country I've visited, their most expensive soaps are no where close to mine. They might be quadruple-milled, but they still are basically oil-stripping soaps.\n", "nutrition - Is it safe to drink urine when you have nothing else to drink?": "\nIf you are in a no-other-liquid situation then not, it's not safe to drink. The problem is that your urine is a way to remove superfluous minerals and other stuff from the body. The body's job, especially in a state of dehydration, is to remove this waste with the least amount of water sufficient to flush it away. \nIf you then drink this urine, you are ingesting back all the salts you just got rid of. You are not getting your liquid-to-salts ratio better, you are making it worse. So when you are already dehydrated, you get dehydrated even quicker if you drink your urine. \nIf you are at no risk of dehydration (you can additionally ingest sufficient water from drinks or food), then the above does not apply. As long as you don't have an urinary tract infection, your urine is also sterile, so you are not at risk of infection either. This makes urine safe to drink. \nThere are people who drink urine (outside of dehydration situations) for supposed health benefits, but I have never heard of any evidence that such benefits exist. \nI don't know of peer reviewed sources for this, but the dangers of drinking urine for survival are both logical from a theoretical view point and common knowledge in outdoor lore, for example see http://survivalcache.com/water-purification/. \nThe Outdoors site has the same question, with a suggestion for a possible purification method which might remove the dissolved minerals. But urine is also rich in organic compounds and starts breeding bacteria almost immediately upon leaving your body. So I'd be weary to try it: fresh urine is safe, but urine which has stood around at room temperature isn't. \n", "infection - Are there high chances of long term complications from having TB?": "\nThere are complications involved with TB itself and with the treatment. \nThe TB itself is likely to resolve (assuming it isn't resistant which it should have been tested for). Thus no complications caused by TB should occur which would be damage to structures in the neck or elsewhere affected by TB and disease if TB had spread across the body. \nThe treatment has a number of side effects. These include\n\nThe oral contraceptive might not work\nCan damage your liver and eyes.

If it is witnessed - that is, the patient is being monitored and the alarm goes off, you're right there at the bedside, and the patient is in V Fib, it's fine to shock first.\nHowever, whereas this used to be the norm - shock first - it no longer is, partly because the goals of CPR and ACLS (advanced cardiac life support) are changing. A bit over a decade ago, the goal was restoration of a perfusing rhythm. \nThe new Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines call for CPR to be initiated immediately, assuming the paddles aren't right there and ready to go the moment someone goes into VFib. It needs to be noted, though, that this recommendation does not rest on defibrillation with the aim of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), but on improved neurological outcomes. \nIf the heart is in V Fib, there is no effective blood circulation; the heart and all the other organs are starving for oxygen. While setting up to defibrillate, the hypoxia continues, and the damage becomes more severe, especially to sensitive tissue like the brain. Compressions circulate blood; even blood with lower oxygen saturation is better than none. The brain is less hypoxic, then, and neurological outcomes improve if defibrillation is successful.\nThis, not ROSC, is what the new ACLS recommendations are based on, because ACLS is not considered highly successful if the patient leaves the hospital only to be hospitalized elsewhere in a persistent vegetative state. And CPR first has been shown to provide better neurological outcomes.\nVF/Pulseless VT\nDelaying Defibrillation to Give Basic Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation to Patients With Out-of-Hospital Ventricular Fibrillation A Randomized Trial\n", "quantified self - What user error can lead to a too-low blood pressure measurement?": "\nThe easiest way to find out what might be wrong is to take the apparatus to a healthcare practitioner's office with you, and have your BP measured by someone trained to do so correctly, then use the cuff, and see how closely they match. Then adjust the looseness/tightness of the cuff, the position, etc., until you get matching BP's consistently.\nAccurate BP measurements depend on a number of things, but one that is really important is the rate at which the cuff deflates. If it deflates too quickly, it will give you falsely low BP's, in addition to BP's \"all over the place\" (some accurate, some not, some with a normal systolic pressure, but an abnormal diastolic pressure, etc.\nIf you can't find out what's wrong by correlating with manual BP readings, the apparatus is unreliable, therefore worthless.\n", "dentistry - Can effervescent multivitamin tablets cause teeth problems?": "\nCouldn't find any articles directly looking at effervescent tablets and dental problems, so I took a more broad look and searched for citric acid's effect on teeth.\nThe combination of citric acid and sodium bicarbonate are routinely used in effervescent tablets designed for human consumption (according to Wikipedia ;).\nCitric acid is commonly found in many fruit juices and many soft drinks we consume have an acidic pH. I found an article that looks specifically at citric acid compared with artificial saliva. \n\nHence, enamel wear in the citric acid solution was significantly higher than in the artificial saliva\n\nThe study found that citric acid had a negative affect on tooth wear compared with artificial saliva. I would be cautious trying to relate these results to something like drinking an effervescent multivitamin solution though; the tooth exposure to citric acid was probably longer than if you just drank a solution and especially if you washed your mouth and brushed your teeth after.\nSo to recap:\n\nEffervescent tablets usually contain citric acid which is the only compound I researched, so those not containing citric acid don't apply to this\nCitric acid and other acids are fairly well established as \"bad\" for your teeth, most notably sodas and acidic fruit drinks\nI assume that brushing your teeth or washing your mouth out after use would help, but I can't back that up with any research\n\nSo effervescent tablets containing citric acid is worse than saliva for your teeth, but how much of an effect it would have especially with infrequent use I can't really say.\nReferences:\nZheng, J., Huang, H., Shi, M., Zheng, L., Qian, L., & Zhou, Z.

That does tell you something. Eating to maintain energy and strength during sports is physiological. Eating the same amount once you stop engaging in that sport is going to add weight.\nThere are all kinds of diets out there which, usually for monetary reasons, claim superiority over one another. You don't need to read about or follow any one specific diet to lose weight. If you decrease caloric intake over a sufficient period of time, you will lose weight.\n\nReduced-calorie diets result in clinically meaningful weight loss regardless of which macronutrients they emphasize.\n\nOne approach you can take is to eat the same stuff you eat right now, but eat less of it. If you eat a Wendy's Baconator for lunch on Saturdays, leave some of it uneaten. Leave a third of your shake, a third of your fries, etc. At home, eat a smaller portion of everything equally. If you consume sweets, like soda or other nutritionally empty calories, cut them out or cut them back.\nExercise. Take walks, take hikes, ride a bike. A male your age probably plays video games. Cut back on these, and do something which exercises your body instead (it doesn't matter what; listening to your summer reading list on audiotape while walking/bicycling/etc. will do the job.) Learn to swim if you don't already know, and keep in shape this summer by swimming regularly.\nIf you have medical problems, have other symptoms of concern other than just weight gain (e.g. fatigue, constipation, a change in your voice/hoarseness, weakness, etc.), or any other symptoms of concern, see a doctor. If, after an honest effort was made to lose weight, you are unable to, you can see a doctor for more specialized help and to determine if you need testing.\nComparison of Weight-Loss Diets with Different Compositions of Fat, Protein, and Carbohydrates\n", "nutrition - How to increase my bodyweight?": "\nI think I can answer this question as I'm in similar situation.\nYou can definitely gain weight by following these steps:\n\nConsult a doctor and get yourself checked so as to make sure that you don't have any medical problem or any food allergy.\nBecause you need to gain weight, you will have to start eating more than you do now. So, increase your number of meals from 3 to 4 and from 4 to 5. First, eat less in each diet but increase diet frequency. A time will come when you will start eating after every two hours of so.\nExercise. It will take regular practise but you can start with these Youtube video\nAnd you need to make sure that you eat healthy afterwards you start gaining weight.

It reminds me of this amusing quote by Henry David Thoreau:\n\nOne farmer says to me, 'You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for\n  it furnishes nothing to make bones with;' and so he religiously\n  devotes a part of his day to supplying his system with the raw\n  material of bones; walking all the while he talks behind his oxen,\n  which, with vegetable-made bones, jerk him and his lumbering plow\n  along in spite of every obstacle.\n\nAlso, this study seems to be saying that vegetables can supply as much calcium as milk:\n\nRecent absorption studies in humans with low-oxalate and low-phytate\n  vegetables and pulses also showed that contrary to common\n  presuppositions, these vegetables with low calcium chelators do have a\n  comparable calcium absorbability to milk.\n\nBut the intake of calcium is just part of the equation - calcium is also lost by excretion, which is what makes oisteoporosis possible. Many studies, such as this one entitled \"Excess dietary protein can adversely affect bone\", report that high consumption of protein in the diet leads to increased excretion of calcium due to the acids formed in the metabolism of protein.\nFinally, an article published on Harvard's own website considers the 1,000-1,200 mg RDA for calcium recommended by the National Academy of Sciences, which were based on short-term studies, and raises them to question based on long-term studies:\n\nIn particular, these [long term] studies suggest that high calcium\n  intake doesn\u2019t actually appear to lower a person\u2019s risk for\n  osteoporosis. For example, in the large Harvard studies of male health\n  professionals and female nurses, individuals who drank one glass of\n  milk (or less) per week were at no greater risk of breaking a hip or\n  forearm than were those who drank two or more glasses per week.\n\nThe article describes several more studies that found no benefit to bone strength from high milk consumption.\n", "Is there evidence that lowering blood pressure via medication is decreasing mortality?": "\nYes, mortality benefits for blood pressure medicine have been demonstrated in trials.\nLet me just preface this by saying this was much harder to find than I was expecting. Questioning the benefit of blood pressure reduction is medical heresy, so you'd think you wouldn't have trouble finding the data out there.\nFirst of all, let's define the question. We're asking whether treatment of hypertension leads to lower mortality in the setting of a randomized clinical trial. Reading between the lines, I think what we really want to know is whether treatment of isolated hypertension (i.e. in patients that have no strokes, heart failure or other diseases associated with hypertension) leads to lower mortality in a randomized clinical trial. Treating hypertension after a stroke or heart attack is hands down beneficial (see HOPE, PART2, IDNT, NICOLE or PREVENT trials [1-5]). You can't answer the question with this data though, because maybe the drug is really just treating the heart attack or stroke. \nTo get data specifically on treating hypertension itself, not in the setting of other medical problems, you have to go back to the 1960s. The VA COOP Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents [6,7] trial specifically looked at treating people who just came into the clinic with high blood pressure. Mortality was 5% lower in the treatment group, or, for every 20 people treated for 3.3 years (the average time people were enrolled in the study), 1 person will have their life saved. Honestly, this is a pretty good outcome as far as drugs go, taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks doesn't work nearly as well, for example. The authors collected these numbers on mortality but they didn't test for whether the numbers were likely to have just popped up by chance or not (statistical significance). I crunched them myself with Fisher's exact test and the results were unlikely to have just come up by chance (p value = 0.015) \nSome caveats. This study was old (the word negro is used), but it was really well done. They had the patients go through a 2 month run in phase where they had to take pills that turned their urine orange just so they could see whether they took their pills regularly before letting them in the trial. All the patients and the doctors were blinded. They used sealed envelope randomization. Patients were enrolled from eight different sites. Of course, it was done at the VA in the 60s, so every single patient was a man. Also, the patients weren't exactly free of other diseases. For some reason, the authors didn't just say how many patients had strokes or heart attacks in the past. They devised this \"severity score\" to assess how many health problems people had at the start of the trial. The score went from 0-4 and on average the patients were less than 1. I would say most weren't very sick.\nSome other trials tried to test blood pressure medicines versus placebo but fell short. The Australian Therapeutic Trial in Mild Hypertension [8] had many fewer events than the VA study so weren't quite able to show statistical significance. The benefits to treatment that they measured in this study were way smaller. Treatment reduced death by .15%. So for every 666 people taking the drug for 1 year, 1 person's life would be saved. They were only able to show this was statistically significant when they looked at the numbers for people actually taking the drug. You want to look at everyone that entered the study in the first place though (intention to treat), because you can always invent scenarios where you get biased results if you don't do this. \nThere was one other study that looked at this question. The Oslo study [9] also failed to show that treatment actually saved lives when treating patients with just hypertension.\nKeep in mind that all of these studies were able to show benefit to treating (fewer strokes, less kidney failure) but mortality was really only lower in the VA trial. My gut tells me that this was because aged American veterans were less healthy to start with then relatively healthy Norwegians and Australians (the population from the other studies). It was less of a needle-in-a-haystack challenge in the VA trial.\nSometime in the 70s or 80s, it seems that doctors all decided that treating hypertension was the way to go no matter how healthy the patient was otherwise so we don't have any more studies. \nReferences\n\nHOPE (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation) Study Investigators.\nEffects of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, on\ncardiovascular events in high-risk patients.

Wikipedia article about thermoregulation contains a very nice graph about that mechanism.\n\nThe labels are not described in the text in detail and the reference in the caption does not include this picture. Picture is a work by one JW Dietrich and I also searched PubMed for this guy, but he has no works on this topic. \nAnother more pragmatic picture is here.\n\nFever or increased body temperature is almost solely caused by to the production prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 acts on the hypothalamus or the thermoregulator of the body and as a result body temperature increases (1). PGE2 production is controlled by the immune system. Fever is meant to have a good cause since fever is supposed to help killing the bacteria or viruses causing any illness.\nAntipyretics are drugs which interact with PGE2. Basically they suppress the formation of PGE2. In that way they \"treat\" the fever.\nAs can be seen from the control circuit describing the thermoregulation PGEs has nothing to with this process. Due to this, blocking non existing PGE2 production during normal body temperature has no effect whatsoever which would cause the body temperature to drop. Even it would happen with some mysterious cause, the body rapidly balance the situation as seen above in the figures.\n", "dentistry - Why is the retainer tight whenever I put it on?": "\nI will answer your questions separately:\n1) Teeth can shift on their own, due to the fact that they are supported by the periodontal ligament (PDL) that holds the teeth by their roots in your mouth, while still allowing them to move slightly. Think of it as a shock absorber. \nMost movement of teeth happens due to pressure that is applied to your teeth (ex: biting when eating) but also when an orthodontist slowly moves the teeth into place by having the orthodontic wire push and pull your teeth in a certain way for a long time. \nWearing a retainer is important, to prevent the teeth from returning to the way they were before wearing braces. The periodontal ligament has a certain memory and will tend to \"spring\" back to where it was before.\n2) Your orthodontist should tell you exactly how often and how long you should wear the retainer. Here is an example of what an orthodontist might tell you: \"Some retainers are used full-time for the first 6 months; after that, the retainers are worn only at night, for a few years. Other retainers are worn full-time for about a week, and solely at night thereafter. Fixed retainers are normally kept in place for 5 years\" [1]\n3) Yes, you may drink water with your retainer in your mouth.

Even large members such as arms and legs are often survivable because the body is very good at protecting itself from blood loss. For example, transected arteries will spasm and clamp off blood flow, and loss of blood will cause the body to divert blood flow away from the extremities and to the vital organs, thereby slowing the bleeding and allowing it to clot. In fact, the whole shock process can be viewed as a set of defensive measures by the body to ensure survival in the face of serious injury. This was a bitter lesson learned by emergency medicine only fairly recently. The standard practice used to be to infuse hypovolemic patients with fluids to maintain normal blood pressure. The trouble is, a normal blood pressure prevents the body from realizing it has inadequate blood volume and turns off its defensive measures, thus allowing the bleeding to continue unabated. \nLeft to fend for himself, a healthy adult would almost certainly survive having his penis removed. With modern medical care, that becomes a certainty.\nCould he still urinate? Sure, as long as the urethra wasn't blocked. It could become blocked by clotted blood, but eventually the pressure of a full bladder would overcome the blockage.\n", "stress - Anxiety and panic attack relieves": "\nI have suffered from health anxiety for the last couple of years and let me share some of the things I find helpful.\n\nStay hydrated: Drinking loads of water instantly relieves the tightness in your throat and definitely helps alleviate anxiety. If you think you're about to have a panic attack start drinking till your stomach is full and think about the movement of water inside you. This will help you alleviate some of the anxiety.\nTake Deep Breaths: When you get anxious, flight and fight hormones are released into your bloodstream that causes muscle tightness and increased metabolism, elevated heartbeat rate etc. You must start taking deep controlled breaths as soon as you feel anxious. Also by counting backwards from 10 to 1 as you breathe it will help your mind achieve relaxation more quickly\nHypnosis & Meditation: This is the long term solution to attack the anxiety itself. There are youtubers like Michael Sealey and Jason Stephenson who have wonderful meditation/hypnosis video guides that will help you learn how to control your anxiety and have a more positive outlook. Don't try to meditate when you're having a panic attack as this may irritate you further. Make it a routine to meditate on a daily basis for at least 40-50 mins. While it may not cure your anxiety it will definitely help you and motivate you to practice more meditation and ease your anxiety.\n\nRemember if your anxiety has a psychological source such as some kind of pain or worry then it may be useful to address those issues first. Ask yourself questions like why am I anxious? Is there a specific reason? Identify the reason and act accordingly. If you have a generalized anxiety disorder then meditation on a daily basis should rid you of anxiety once and for all. \n", "cancer - Safety of using a luggage with the prop. 65 warning": "\nA California Proposition 65 warning doesn't really tell you anything about the safety of the luggage.\nProposition 65 requires warnings if somebody may be exposed to a substance that has a 1 in 100,000 chance of causing cancer over the course of 70 years, or has the possibility of causing birth defects or reproductive harm, as determined by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.\nHowever, there is nothing preventing warnings even if there is no risk whatsoever.  Proposition 65 permits members of the general public to sue over missing warnings, and California has a cottage industry of lawyers filing these suits any time they find something that doesn't have such a warning.  As a result, these warnings are often used as an incantation to ward off lawyers rather than an actual indication of hazard.  See, for example, Consumer Defense Group v. Rental Housing Industry members, where the list of potential carcinogens included \"automobile exhaust from cars in the parking lot\" and \"the possibility that someone on the grounds of the apartment building might be smoking a cigarette\".  As part of the initial settlement of that suit, a warning was posted at the entrance to each building referring to a two-page list of things that might reasonably be found in or around an apartment building -- not because the apartment had lead-based paint, or used perchloroethylene cleaners, or had asbestos insulation, but to prevent further lawsuits.\n", "growth hormones - How to increase body height?": "\nUnfortunately, height is genetically based.\nAt 24 years old, it is unlikely that you will grow more, but the only way to know for sure is if you have an x ray done of the growth plates in your bones to see if they have disappeared. If they have, then there really is no natural way to increase height.\nThere are surgical procedures (See this article) where you can potentially add a few inches, but they are very costly (The procedure described in the article cost ~ $90,000 US dollars), and they are reported to be very painful, long (3+ months) and require extensive rehabilitation and physical therapy to be successful. According to the article, most places that do the procedure use it primarily for physical afflictions such as dwarfism, and do not recommend it for purely cosmetic reasons.\n", "smoking - Do low-nicotine low-tar cigarettes have less negative impact on health than standard ones?": "\nProbably yes on lung cancer, no for other diseases, but it's really hard to say.\nApparently, this 'trend' isn't very new - it goes back to the 1960s, though back then low-tar cigarettes contained more tar than you specify in your question. The National Cancer Institute has a looong monograph on this with data from the past decades: Risks Associated with Smoking Cigarettes with Low Machine Measured Yields of Tar and Nicotine. I am not even going to pretend I read all of that. \nThe chapter Smoking Lower Yield Cigarettes and Disease Risks is in itself 94 pages long, but is summarized in the paper Health impact of \u201creduced yield\u201d cigarettes: a critical assessment of the epidemiological evidence.\nApparantly, it's not very clear-cut, the primary problem being that there's so many confunders when looking at epidemiological (population-based) data:\n\nsmokers who choose to smoke cigarettes with less tar/nicotine might be more concerned about their health in general\nsmoker who choose to smoke cigarettes with less tar/nicotine 'compensate' by smoking more, see the linked paper where figure 2 illustrates that lower nicotine content often corresponds with a higher amount of cigarettes smoked. This is often ignored in studies by matching subjects by number of cigarettes smoked (so they compare people who smoke 10 high-yield cigarettes a day with those who smoke 10 low-yield cigarettes a day)\n\nFrom the conclusions, emphasis mine:\n\nEpidemiological studies have not consistently found lesser risk of diseases, other than lung cancer, among smokers of reduced yield cigarettes. Some studies have found lesser risks of lung cancer among smokers of reduced yield cigarettes. Some or all of this reduction in lung cancer risk may reflect differing characteristics of smokers of reduced-yield compared to higher-yield cigarettes.\n\nNow, the National Cancer Institute is not generally a fan of cigarettes, so they are probably going to recommend against low-tar/nicotine cigarettes in any case. It does seem to be the case that if the number of cigarettes is kept constant, the risk of lung cancer decreases with tar content. The same is not necessarily the case for other risks, like that of coronary heart disease, stroke, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n", "otolaryngology - Can \"Waterproof Swim Cap\" be good for people with ear infections?": "\nIt sounds like you're talking about otitis externa, an infection of the ear canal, a condition where you really should avoid getting any water in your ear.\nYou've already identified that the cap in question is not really waterproof. \nThe best way (and really the only way) to keep water out of your ear is to stay out of the water until your ear has had time to clear the infection.\nTo bathe, you can make a cheap waterproof ear plug by working a generous amount of petroleum jelly into a cotton ball, and using that as an earplug. You can also buy a special soft wax at most pharmacies. People roll a ball of the soft wax in their hands and press it into the outer ear. \nOnce the infection is healed, if you're not prone to such infections, you can use home-made or pharmacy bought ear drops after occasional swimming which will help maintain the proper environment to minimize infection in the ear. Use of a hair dryer on low to dry your ear is also useful.\nHigh-grade silicone ear plugs can be used once the ear is healed, however, ear plugs can aggravate or cause the condition, so swimmers (or people occupationally required or recommended to wear ear plugs) usually consult with ear specialists to work out the best plug to use which will not cause damage to the ear canal, something critical for prevention.\nOtitis Externa: A Practical Guide to Treatment and Prevention\n", "What is excess blood from blood donations used for, and do we ever run out?": "\nGreat question!

Well, actually your question is impossible to answer. :-) We could never know whether someone could-have-been-saved with a transfusion nor whether someone who received a transfusion would-have-died. Those are hypothetical constructs that are interesting to think about but are not compatible with research. \nHowever, we can ask whether there is evidence that blood supply on a clinical level is limited, for instance: \n\ndoctors are requesting products that aren't available for patients;  \ndoctors are requesting fewer products than they think would be ideal for a particular patient because of a blood bank shortage;    \nelective surgeries are being postponed; or \nblood banks are substituting products that may have a slightly increased risk of complications due to less-than-ideal immune compatibility.\n\nAll of these are more nuanced than they seem, but to some degree all do occur. \nQuoting from a paper in the journal Transfusion entitled How do I manage a blood shortage in a transfusion service?:\n\nAlthough there are more than 16 million blood donations per year provided to more than 4 million recipients, blood shortages have recurred for decades [...] twice every year. Anyone with any experience at blood centers or transfusion services is quite accustomed to these expected shortages.\n\nHe further notes that this problem is likely to worsen because the requirement for transfusions (all types) is increasing at a rate of 5-7% per year while donations are not matching that increase.\nThe first thing that happens when there is a blood bank shortage usually involves the Transfusion Medicine specialist in the blood bank having a conversation with every doctor who orders the blood product that is limited. Together they determine whether a smaller amount of product or a deferment in transfusion might be clinically appropriate/acceptable. \nThe distinction between those last two words \u2014 appropriate|accetable \u2014 is the key to whether clinical care is actually being compromised. In many cases, clinicians indeed are requesting product beyond what is recommended in published guidelines, because they feel that the patient's condition warrants it due to some special circumstance. It seems likely that at least a small percentage of the time, the clinician was right, but this can never be proven.\nIt is also the case that elective surgeries are sometimes postponed for this reason (see chart 8-1, p 43), although it's rare. \nAnother question\n\nRelated, if we don't run a deficit then what happens to my excess blood?... is it used for medical research?\n\nAlthough localized shortages of particular products do occur and are disruptive, it is true that a small percentage of the products expire unused. In the U.S., this was estimated at 14% of supply in 1989 and had fallen to 5.2% in 2011, per a report from the US Dept Health and Human Services, the most recent data available I've found. These are complicated and nuanced data that this format does not allow complete explanation of (and I myself am not completely familiar with), but please read the linked HHS report if interested.\nAs for what happens to the excess - it's probably discarded, although I can't prove that. Regarding your question about research: In addition to being sub-optimal because it's old, the blood was originally collected from human donors. Such research would be subjected to IRB requirements for protection of human subjects. This would likely require researchers to obtain permission from donors (/subjects) at the time of donation to use the product for research. This may happen in localized settings, but I know of no large-scale project.\n\n\n* I limit this discussion to the U.S. While I realize the weaknesses \u2014 inadequacy, really \u2014 of that approach, this is the healthcare system where I was able to locate data, the O.P. is apparently asking about the U.S. situation (Red Cross), and I am most familiar with the clinical situation here. If another answer can offer a more global perspective, please do.\n\n", "Are platelet donations needed more than whole blood?": "\nI don't know if anyone can give a definite answer as to why these folks so badly wanted you to donate platelets over whole blood, but there are many possible reasons.\n\nPlatelets give you more bang for your buck. According to the American Red Cross, one session of platelet apheresis can collect enough platelets for one or two transfusions. On the other hand, it can take anywhere from four to six donations of whole blood to get the same amount of platelets.\nPlatelets are always needed, at high rates. The first point is important, because those who use platelets often use them in bulk (some organ transplant patients need up to 30 units worth1 - see a page from University Health System).\nPlatelets have a short shelf life. Blood Centers of America states that even with some processing, platelets need to be transfused within about five days after the donation, meaning that waiting can cause the loss of an entire donation. There is a constant need for refills (for lack of a better word). Even this narrow window has been modified in the past, shrinking or growing (see Sireis et al. (2011)).\nPlatelets are used for cancer patients. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center says that patients who are suffering from leukemia or have just had a bone marrow transplant may have low platelet levels. The transfusions can be essential - life-saving.\nPeople might not like donation platelets.[Citation needed!] This one is a complete guess on my part, but platelet donation can take a long time, as you said. People are averse to donating blood for many reasons; as you stated, the long donation session for platelets only makes this worse. You've shown that you were willing in the past to go through with this, so the blood donation center probably thinks that you're more likely to do it again.\n\n\n1 One donation can give about 6-8 -\"units\". See the Johns Hopkins Pathology page on platelets for more information.\n", "sleep - Nasal congestion on wakeup in healthy individuals vs. vasomotor rhinitis sufferers": "\nLet's first clarify that \"vasomotor rhinitis (VMR) otherwise known as non-allergic rhinitis\" is the non-allergic reaction (NAR), which can be similar in symptoms to the allergic reaction (AR), but not the same.\n\nVasomotor rhinitis is a poorly understood disorder which mimics many\n  of the symptoms of nasal allergy, but has a completely different\n  basis. Failure to recognize these differences has led to a great deal\n  of misunderstanding about this disorder.\n\nThis symptom might be more common in allergic rhinitis (AR), though we can't really be sure, since we don't know how commonly it occurs in everyone else. (It breaks down into a statistics problem which we can only approximate with certain assumptions.)\nHowever, based on this study:\nNonallergic Rhinitis, With a Focus on Vasomotor Rhinitis Clinical Importance, Differential Diagnosis, and Effective Treatment Recommendations\n\n[One survey of US medical practices] suggest that at least 57% of rhinitis\n  patients have some\n  contribution from NAR [Nonallergic rhinitis] causing their rhinitis symptoms. Similar\n  European studies have found that approximately 1 in 4 patients\n  complaining of nasal symptoms has pure NAR [2].\n\nSo it seems that people often mix up Allergic Rhinitis (AR) and NAR so much, that even many cases of \"AR\" are actually still just NAR. So maybe people with AR have AR occurances instead of NAR, and NAR to NR ratio is about 1-to-1. However, if we assume that all people have relatively the same number of NAR symptoms, then it seems likely that people with AR have at least slightly higher occurances of this symptom.\n", "diet - Eating fast food every single day": "\nI have eaten McDonalds for lunch every (week) day for the past 2+ years, I can tell you it has nothing to do with weight gain or loss.\nFor the vast majority of people, losing and gaining weight is all about calories; nothing else. Genetics plays a role, but it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things.\nThere are many problems with the quality of food from McDonalds, but I will focus on answering your question within regards to weight gain/loss only.\nThe foods at McDonalds are very calorie-dense, and non-satiating. One big mac has ~563 calories... add on the large fires (~480) and large coke (~310) with that and it equals over 1300 calories.\n1300+ calories is an INSANE amount for one meal, which won't even keep you satiated (full) for very long. \nTherefore, it's really a poor choice when it comes to weight loss.. because if you are trying to lose weight, your daily caloric intake wouldn't be too much higher than that (unless you're a bodybuilder or athlete). Some short women wouldn't even have 1300 calories total in their daily intake... that's how much calories that is.\nThat being said, if you're on some kind of diet such as intermittent fasting, and you don't eat much else other than that single meal a day.. you can still successfully lose weight even if you eat this meal each day.\nAs long as the calories you consume each day is lower than your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure), you will lose weight.\n", "What causes twitching eyelids? Can anything be done about them?": "\n\"Normal\" eyelid twitching can possibly be caused or be made worse by lack of sleep, or too much caffeine or stress. That information can be found unsourced on a lot of websites, including with such qualifiers as \"many experts say\". I couldn't find a single source - which doesn't mean it doesn't exist, or say that these things don't cause eyelid twitches.\nThe Kellogg Eye Centre at the University of Michigan just says:\n\nThe cause of minor eyelid twitch is unknown.\n\nAnd for treatment:\n\nMinor eyelid twitches require no treatment as they usually resolve spontaneously. Reducing stress, using warm soaks, correction of any refractive error, and lubrication of the eye with artificial tears may help. Some ophthalmologists recommend reducing caffeine usage\n\nThe University of Maryland Medical Center mentions, just like a lot of sources, caffeine, sleep and stress\n\nThe most common things that make the muscle in your eyelid twitch are fatigue, stress, and caffeine.\n\nAnd for treatment:\n\nEyelid twitching most often goes away without treatment. In the meantime, the following steps may help:\n\nGet more sleep.\nDrink less caffeine.\nLubricate your eyes with eye drops\n\nIf twitching is severe or lasts a long time, small injections of botulinum toxin can control the spasms\n\nHowever, since you specifically mentioned blepharospasm, I am going to include some information on what's called benign essential blepharospasm. That's a condition that worsens with age, and often ends up including more face muscles than just the eyelids. It's probably caused at least in part by genetics, but the exact gene responsible for it remains unclear. Treatment for it includes medication, for example dopamine inhibitors, botox injections, and even surgery to remove the eyelid muscle.\nInterestingly, for benign essential blepharospasm, drinking coffee might actually delay onset of the disease.\nSources\nKellogg Eye Center\nUniversity of Maryland Medical Center\nBenign essential blepharospasm\nBenign essential blepharospasm @ rarediseases.org\nUpdate on blepharospasm\n", "how many 'lives' are saved from one donation of blood?": "\nI think your skepticism may come from not understanding the process behind the claim.  \nA single unit of blood is separated into 4 main \"blood products\": red blood cells, plasma, platelets, and white blood cells. Another product called cryoprecipitate can be produced from frozen then thawed plasma and is used in special circumstances.  Whole blood is rarely used for transfusions anymore because of problems with transfusion reactions and, quite frankly, except in the case of massive hemorrhage, a single person rarely needs all these components all at once (and even then they probably won't need white blood cells).  Red blood cells (or packed red blood cells) are what most people think of when they get a \"blood transfusion.\"  Plasma is given to people who do not have enough clotting factors in their blood to stop bleeding that is currently occurring or if it should occur.  Platelets are given to people who are not producing enough platelets to keep them from bleeding to death.  White blood cells are rarely given anymore, but there may be occasion to use them in specific cases.\nNow did that one unit save up to 3 lives?  Well, to answer that the question of whether their lives were in danger to begin with has to be answered.  The answer is, \"Yes!\"  When will they die without the product?  For some it's in the next several minutes, for others it may be hours, days or weeks, but in every case these peoples lives are in danger without the products derived from human blood.\nBut did that unit all by itself achieve this? No, but in concert with the donations of others it contributed to saving \"up to 3 lives.\" Because doctors try avoid using precious blood products until it is absolutely necessary by treating patients with other methods if possible, so by the time a person definitely requires blood products, they will get more than one unit, but had they been given products earlier without giving the 'other methods' a chance to work they would have needed just as much, maybe more, over time.\nThe American Cancer Society has an excellent summary of types of blood transfusions and what they are used for here. \nI don't think the claim is derived from any particular set of statistics or the hard and fast numbers that you are seeking, but from the process involved.\nEDIT:\nThe best collection of statistical information online may be Blood Transfusion and Donation published by the National Institutes of Health and The 2011 National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey Report (PDF), published by the US Department of Health and Human Services (and several other departments and agencies).  These 2 documents contain the most current comprehensive data available on blood collection and transfusion.\n", "nutrition - What are the health risks associated with Monosodium Glutamate, if any?": "\nThere several concerns related to MSG (monosodium glutamate):\n\nit contains sodium, so it might rise the blood pressure leading to hypertension, a risk factor of cardiovascular diseases.

They based their conclusion on studies showing that fluoride exposure during pregnancy can damage the brain which was consistent with three other studies from China which found that the brain of the human fetus can be significantly damaged by the mother\u2019s high fluoride intake (safe dose for preventing this effect is not yet known).\n\nFurther more, the National Research Council (NRC) expressed concern about fluoride\u2019s possible contribution to dementia and \"it is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain and the body by direct and indirect means\"2006.\n\nIt is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain. (National Research Council, 2006)\n\nA more recent \u201cmeta-analysis\u201d of 27 cross-sectional studies performed by Harvard researchers, did a systematic review of children exposed to fluoride in drinking water (mainly from China), which suggested that children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas (an average IQ decrement of about seven points in children exposed to higher fluoride concentrations)2012.\n\nSome studies suggested that even slightly increased fluoride exposure could be toxic to the brain. \n\nIn March of 2014, The Lancet medical journal published a review of neurobehavioral effects of developmental toxicity, which concluded that fluoride is one of only 11 chemicals that is known to damage the developing brain and it is capable of causing widespread brain disorders such as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning disabilities, and other cognitive impairments. In most cases the damage is often untreatable and permanent2014. According to this, fluoride is classified as dangerous to developing brains.\nIn a bulletin posted on the Harvard School of Public Health website, Grandjean notes that:\n\nFluoride seems to fit in with lead, mercury, and other poisons that cause chemical brain drain.

Does it provide extra minerals, hormones and enzymes needed for the body?": "\nYour own Wikipedia page already states that \"There is no scientific evidence of a therapeutic use for untreated urine\" and \"According to the American Cancer Society, \"available scientific evidence does not support claims that urine or urea given in any form is helpful for cancer patients\" \"\nBut lets me show you more detailed evidence. First urine is nothing more than : \n\nUrine is an aqueous solution of greater than 95% water, with the remaining constituents, in order of decreasing concentration, urea 9.3 g/L, chloride 1.87 g/L, sodium 1.17 g/L, potassium 0.750 g/L, creatinine 0.670 g/L and other dissolved ions, inorganic and organic compounds (see this nasa study)\n\nWe know that urine is not 100% sterile, but usually won't harm a healthy people if you drink it (and the urine is from a healthy person too that didn't drink any drug or poisons) but the only situation i can see it would be good to drink your own urine is if you are dehydrating to death and even that is not really recommended ( see this wonderful question on skeptics.se ) \nBut you could think if we have potassium and other minerals in urine why not drink it? Because you can get much more by eating food and hormones are produced by your own body you don't need to drink pee to replace that, and they become urine for a good reason, see the conclusion of this study :\n\nIt is strongly suggested that alternative therapies should be non-hazardous, and therefore, inappropriate administration of remedies, such as urine therapy in pediatric health conditions should be discouraged, considering the fact that no documented scientific / clinical evidence of the beneficial effect of urine therapy in clinical had been reported, while multiple antibiotic resistant bacterial species had also been recovered from such urine.\n\nEdit: About your medicines listed.\n\nMetrodin = Wrong. Metrodin is is a man-made hormone called follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH is produced in the body by the pituitary gland. May appear on urine, however in very low concentrations to justify drinking your own pee.\nPergonal = Wrong. Menotropins are a mixture of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) that are produced in the body by the pituitary gland. May appear on urine, however in very low concentrations to justify drinking your own pee.\nPanafil = Wrong.It is a proteolytic enzyme derived from the fruit of carica papaya. The only possible (not 100%) way its going to end up in your urine is if you are eating the fruit.\n2-CdA = 2-CdA is the trade name for cladribine. Leustatin and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine are other names for cladribine. It was extracted from urine and according to Wikipedia it was first synthesized at Brigham Young University (meaning they don't extract it from urine anymore), they do appear in urine but in too low concentrations to justify drinking your own pee.\nUrokinase and Wikipedia page = Urokinase is a man-made product developed using a protein that occurs naturally in the kidneys. Urokinase is made from human kidney cells and albumin (part of the blood) which may contain viruses and other infectious agents. Urokinase was originally isolated from human urine, but is present in several physiological locations, such as blood stream and the extracellular matrix. Again, they do appear in urine but in too low concentrations to justify drinking your own pee.\n\nWhy drinking your own pee to get this substances is completely non-sense?\n\nA single Banana have 450mg of potassium or 13% of our recommended intake. 2L of urine have 1500mg potassium or ~31% of recommended daily intake. But at this scale you would get 18,6g of urea, 3,74g of chloride and 2,34g of sodium too.\n\nNow American Heart Association in 2010 chose to recommend that Americans eat less than 1,500 mg/day sodium as part of the definition of ideal cardiovascular health.. So you going 840mg above your ideal sodium consumption only with urine, long term drinking urine and a diet high in sodium will really hurt your health. (I don't think i have to cite the consequences of too much sodium right? Just google for it)\nNow see the dangers of excess of Chloride note that The normal adult value for chloride is 97-107 mEq/L. and you will be consuming 3,74g to get only ~31% of your potassium intake. I didn't find a good converter online so i will let this to someone who can do this math. But just 1g/l is a lot more than 107meq/l. You only going to make your poor kidney to work much harder to handle all this chloride.\nNow about urea, this study says:\n\nThere is limited information to suggest that the liver, kidney, and pituitary could be targets of urea toxicity. Under the Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (U.S. EPA, 2005a), there is \u201cinadequate information to assess the carcinogenic potential\u201d of urea. Epidemiologic studies of humans chronically exposed to urea alone or urea-containing mixtures are limited.\n\nBut drinking 18,6g of urea daily surely can't be good to you. There is no scientific evidence for health benefits of drinking this. Lack of studies is not equal to no toxicity! \nFor hormones i think you can see why is totally no-sense, the amount of urine you would have to drink to get any considerable amount would be insane and toxic.\n", "dermatology - Is petroleum jelly comedogenic?": "\nYou are right that there are conflicting viewpoints about whether or not Vaseline and other types of petroleum jelly, also known as petrolatum, are comedogenic (can cause or worsen acne). There are medical professionals who will say that petroleum jelly will cause acne, while others might argue the opposite. The same also goes for research, though most research points to petroleum jelly being non-comedogenic. \nWhy might petroleum jelly be comedogenic? Petroleum jelly is very greasy. This greasiness could cause petroleum jelly to be comedogenic. Research has also shown this may be the case, but there is also some more reliable research that suggests that this is false. Because people have wondered if petroleum jelly is comedogenic for a long time, most studies on this topic are a little bit older (pre-2000). Also, most studies that suggest the petroleum jelly might cause acne were done on rabbits, who are much more sensitive to cosmetics than humans are. \nA 1972 article that introduced acne cosmetica,1 acne caused by cosmetic products, tested many different cosmetic creams on rabbit ear canals, and found that many of them, including petroleum jelly, were mildly comedogenic. The research also found that using petroleum jelly or other cosmetic substances can cause mild acne breakouts in some woman. This research wasn't extremely convincing that petroleum jelly is comedogenic as rabbits aren't the perfect model for seeing what the effect would be on human skin. Also, the research done on petroleum jelly's effect on actual human skin showed that it caused comedonal reactions, but only in some women.\nThe most reliable study testing if petroleum jelly is comedogenic is probably a 1996 study by the same man who did the previous study I mentioned.2 The results, after testing different products that use petroleum jelly on different groups of patients, were that there wasn't any comedogenic potential in petroleum jelly. Petroleum jelly also didn't worsen acne at all.\nIt is most likely that petroleum jelly is not comedogenic. Some studies point to it being comedogenic as a possibility, but rabbit ears are much more sensitive than human skin, so it is impossible to get definitive information from those studies. If you are worried about getting acne from using a product like Vaseline, you should be fine. Odds are, the Vaseline would be helping you more than hurting.\n\n1: \"Acne Cosmetica\"\n2: Petrolalum is not comedogenic in rabbits or humans: A critical reappraisal of the rabbit ear assay and the concept of \"acne cosmetica\" \n", "medications - How offput should one be when drug interaction checkers say \"X will decrease/increase the level or effect of Y by altering drug metabolism\"?": "\nThese interaction checkers are great tools and many physicians use them in making prescription decisions.  A very experienced physician will already know this information about medications they prescribe regularly, but there is so much information and so many medications now, it is good for healthcare consumers to educate themselves about what they are putting into their bodies.\nThe next part of that education is to bring these results and your concerns to your healthcare provider and ask them to explain the risk/benefit balance they believe is being achieved with this particular mix of medications.  At the same time, make sure they are aware of the over-the-counter medications you are using as well, and get their advice on which of those to use or avoid with the mix of medications you are on. \nYour question was, \"How offput should one be by this?\"\nThe ultimate answer for you question is be offput enough to really understand the decisions being made for you in the physician's office, so you can help in making those decisions.

In my opinion this is due to the fact that children aged between 8 and 13 years are not sensible to the great effects of yoga. Hardly any kids that age experience stress or mental problems which could be relieved by mental exercises.\nIn another study slightly older participants were examined (2). When compared to stretching the patients having participated to a yoga intervention showed greater effects in executive functions and also in flexibility.\nIn another study setting women with breast cancer were investigated (3). Again compared to stretching, yoga was superior with regard to quality of life and fitness.\nAs so, I think there is good evidence favouring yoga at least over stretching.

By the same token, bathing with the water may cause significant exposure to the hydrocarbon as it evaporates into the air in the shower.\n", "medications - Why is it so much harder to swallow pills than it is to swallow food?": "\nThe human (and other animals) upper digestive tract is 'designed' to ingest relatively large (compared to most pills), soft, moist boluses.  The muscles of the tongue and pharynx can propel these kinds of objects (including liquid) into the esophagus with ease, unless there is some specific pathology at work.  Chewing also tends to naturally push food toward the swallowing position.\nThe tablets and capsules you asked about, on the other hand, tend to be dry and hard and are not chewed.  There is little for the tongue and throat muscles to 'grab' as they try to push the object back to where it can actually enter the esophagus.  They also tend to get stuck because of their dryness.\nOnce you have actually swallowed a pill without water or food to help it along, the difficulty for the ingestion process does not end.  The esophagus also has difficulty pushing them down to the stomach, though gravity helps.  Sometimes they do end up lodged in the esophagus where they ultimately dissolve and pass on down, but not before they may have caused damage to the lining of the esophagus from their caustic properties or just from the pressure of it's presence.\nThe struggle is your tongue and throat telling you, \"You are asking me to do something I wasn't designed to do!\"\nAnatomy and Physiology of Feeding and Swallowing  \u2013 Normal and Abnormal is an excellent discussion of human swallowing by Koichiro Matsuo, DDS, PhD and Jeffrey B.

This is thought to be the direct cause or indirect cause (due to downstream effects on other neurotransmitter systems) for antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.\nSo far not enough quality studies have been done to fully understand the causes for antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.\n", "nutrition - Should I use salt supplements if my sweat is bland?": "\nWe were taught in physiology that the way to know if you need salt supplementation is whether the salt tastes good or not. The potassium chloride in salt will taste bitter if you don't need it. I have not seen studies to support this - but it fits a general medical principle we observe in other medical conditions.\nThis general principle falls into the category of syndromes like pica which is commonly seen in pregnant patients who eat dirt or clay because they have an iron deficiency. Patients crave clay or dirt or other substances because of their deficiency. Patients are often too embarrassed to tell their doctor. In one case, we had a pregnant patient who the clinician noticed she seemed to want to mention something but wasn't. On further questioning, eventually she confessed. She was sneaking out at night to eat a cup of black dirt from her backyard every night. She didn't know why. The doctor said, \"oh, you have pica\", put her on iron pills and the craving went away. \nIn general, the body craves what it needs - and what it needs tastes good. \n", "For more exotic fruits, need you buy organic or not?": "\nYou may have answered your own question (\"However, these exotic fruits originate from countries with more dubious environmental or safety standards, or without any norms or oversight whatsoever\") if your goal is to eliminate toxic chemicals from your diet.  The point of growing organic food is to minimize, if not eliminate, the presence of toxic chemicals (pesticides, fertilizers, etc.) in the food you consume.  The following articles may help you make the decision:\nIn the article, Organic foods: Are they safer? More nutritious? The Mayo Clinic explains the rationale for \"going organic\", but they also provide some tips that may apply when an organic option is not available, as in the case you cite.  \nIn Conventional vs. Organic: It's Not About Getting More, But Getting Less For Your Money.

Also, sometimes the recommendation is specific to whether or not you have leg edema as elevation during the day may reduce the volume in your body at night.  The recommendations are likely based on physiology and likely taking into account the low risk of leg elevation.\n", "allergy - Can consumer-oriented heart rate tracking devices/smartwatches be used for implementing Dr. Coca's food sensitivity test?": "\nI've seen reports of the Fitbit HR being off by 25 BPM. I'm not familiar with the Dr. Coca pulse test, but the paper you link to mentions pulse rates that differ by only 10 BPM. It appears that consumer Photoplethysmogram monitors work best when the patient is inactive. I suspect the accuracy also depends on your physiology. I would recommend trying a wrist monitor such as the Fitbit HR, a chest strap monitor, and taking your pulse manually. Do this while you're inactive and compare the results. If the Fitbit HR is off from your manual measurement by 25 BPM, it sounds like it won't be useful for the Dr. Coca pulse test.\nThere are other options for monitoring heart rate that are very accurate:\n\nA holter monitor. These are usually prescribed devices--the hospital or physician loans them to you (though it appears you can get them on eBay).\nAn Implantable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) (also known as an Implantable Loop Recorder (ILR)). This is an implantable device similar to a pacemaker, however it only measures your heart activity--it doesn't provide therapy (electrical stimulus). Some examples are the Biotronik BioMonitor and the Medtronik Reveal LINQ.\nThere are disposable holter monitor patches that are coming onto the market. Many of these are still in clinical trials, however. The advantage of these devices is that they don't have to be implanted and you don't have to wear a bulky unit on your belt.\n\nAll three of the options above are used for diagnosing heart conditions by looking at ECG signals--they're probably overkill for your application, but they would work.\n", "toxicity - Does iron poisoning stay in your body?": "\nWe can't diagnose your friend on the internet; only her doctors can do that. Guesses are good in game shows; in medicine, it helps to have more to base a diagnosis on.\nYou are correct that acute iron toxicity (for example, from children eating iron-containing vitamins because they are candy-like) can result in coma. But to my knowledge (and I have seen and treated many metallic foreign bodies), iron toxicity from such an exposure would be unlikely.\nAside from ingestion, the two most common reasons for iron overload are \n1) repeated transfusions required for various anemias (where red blood cells are destroyed by the body and need to be replaced), or when bone marrow has stopped functioning properly and RBC's must be supplied; this is called secondary hemochromatosis,\n2) iron-overload disorders owing to genetic misregulation of iron absorption, referred to as hereditary hemochromatosis (or primary hemochromatosis). \nPrimary hemochromatosis can be treated by removing blood periodically, forcing the body to use up the excess iron, or by chelation therapy. So, untreated, yes, iron overload from this source is permanent. Acute iron toxicity can be treated with chelating agents is severe enough.\nWhile hemochromatosis is not rare, fainting is very common (so common it is difficult to estimate it's occurrence due to underreporting); rough estimates are that at least 35% of the population will have at least one episode in their lifetime. There is a bimodal distribution, with the first peak around the late teens (one-third of medical students report at least one syncopal episode) and the second starting around the seventies.\nAgain, numbers are hard to obtain for fainting (syncope), but the most common cause is vasovagal (fear, pain, prolonged standing, etc.), followed by cardiac causes.\nAlthough fainting is common, the only real way to determine its probable cause is to see a medical professional, who can gather the information necessary to make a diagnosis.\nHemochromatosis (Iron Storage Disease)\nMolecular basis of HFE-hemochromatosis\nEpidemiology of syncope/collapse in younger and older Western patient populations\nIncidence and prognosis of syncope\n", "digestion - What is the mechanism of heartburn?": "\nWebMD has an interesting article on heartburn that states1\n\nWith gravity's help, a muscular valve called the lower esophageal sphincter, or LES, keeps stomach acid in the stomach. The LES is located where the esophagus meets the stomach -- below the rib cage and slightly left of center. Normally it opens to allow food into the stomach or to permit belching, then closes again. But if the LES opens too often or does not close tight enough, stomach acid can reflux, or seep, into the esophagus and cause the burning sensation.\n\nThis would seem to be something of a union of both theories of heartburn. I was slightly doubtful - the article doesn't cite a particular source - but I was able to do a bit of digging on my own and found a few papers and other reliable sources that support this.\n\nBoeckxstaens (2005) states (abstract only)\n\nThe two typical examples of dysfunction of the LOS are achalasia and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). . . . GORD results from failure of the antireflux barrier, with increased exposure of the oesophagus to gastric acid. This leads to symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation, and in more severe cases to oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus and even carcinoma.\n\nThe Keck School of Medicine states\n\nThe esophagus is a muscular tube that connects the pharynx in the throat to the stomach. There are two sphincters at each end, an upper esophageal sphincter and a lower esophageal sphincter. With normal swallowing there is an incredible coordination of neurologic and muscular events for the food or liquid to efficiently pass from the mouth and into the stomach. Any dysfunction in this process can manifest as difficulty swallowing solids and liquids, regurgitation of undigested food, chest pain, and even heartburn.\n\nSpechler et a. (1995) writes\n\n\nHeartburn, the main symptom of gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GORD), might be expected to occur infrequently in achalasia, a disorder characterised by a hypertensive lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) that fails to relax.\n\n\nIt appears the dysfunction of the LES/LOS is considered to be a cause of heartburn, specifically causing GORD, which then leads to heartburn.\nI'd like to emphasize that heartburn generally isn't a standalone illness, but a symptom of something else, just like a sore throat may be a symptom of, say, strep throat. This isn't always the case, but it generally is the case for instances of persistent heartburn.\n\n1 The Mayo Clinic also has a rather accessible article for anyone who doesn't want to trudge through scientific papers.\n", "mental health - How can I manage the symptom of forgetfulness in a patient with dementia?": "\nYou can use pictures of the patients family with captions saying who they are and their relationship to the individual.\nIf they are still able (but forgetful) in the kitchen put pictures on the cupboard fronts to show what is in them.

Alzheimer's is usually not diagnosed until the third or fourth stage, when it can be differentiated from mild cognitive impairment that is common in old age.\nTo aid with diagnosis, it is very helpful if friends/family/caregivers document the type and frequency of symptoms, so the severity and progression can be seen. occasionally forgetting where your keys are is normal - suddenly forgetting that you have been putting your keys next to the door for the last twenty years can be a symptom of Alzheimer's disease.\n", "dermatology - What is the word for the dead skin on the upper layer of a healed wound?": "\nFrankly, medical terminology isn't necessary and might even lead to increased confusion, especially after being translated. All medical terminology is not universal. \nJust state your complaint in plain language as clearly as you can using layman's terms. I doubt that a Japanese doctor needs much more guidance from you than simply understanding your complaint. For example, you might say (in Japanese), \"Doctor, I can't hear as well as I used to and I think it may be due to an injury to my ear canal some time ago. Can you please have a look?\"\nI would expect the doctor to examine both ear canals. If your theory is correct, the doctor won't need further explanation. She will see it with her own eyes and know what to do about it. She will probably also want to test your hearing in both ears. I would not be terribly surprised to find that the cause is something other than what you suspect. \nAssuming that you don't speak fluent Japanese and he/she doesn't speak fluent English, you might consider bringing a translator along with you since the doctor will no doubt have questions and perhaps need to explain things to you. It's the sort of situation where language barriers can be troublesome and you don't want to risk misunderstandings.\n", "cardiology - How much difference should there be between systolic and diastolic pressure?": "\nThe difference between systolic and diastolic pressures is known as the pulse pressure. (If this doesn't make sense, please see another answer of mine where I explained the meanings of the different components of blood pressure.) There is no \"normal\" or \"should\" that are well defined here. Despite that, there is quite a bit that can be said.\nWhat causes them to be ... far apart? * \n\nAge\nOn a population level, the biggest factor is age. With increasing age, pulse pressure increases, sometimes dramatically. \n\nArithmetically, this is because diastolic pressure peaks at about age 55 and delines thereafter, whereas systolic pressure continues to increase throughout life (see Franklin, 1997).  \nPhysiologically, this is because the large vessels tend to \"stiffen\" with age to calcification. As such, when the heart pumps blood into them (systole), they aren't especially elastic, so the diameter doesn't increase much. The result is higher systolic pressure. Similarly, in the period of diastole when flow is lower, the arteries don't rebound to a smaller diameter as robustly as young vessels, so the pressure falls. It is common in 80+ year-olds to see blood pressures like 180/60. I've never seen such a pressure in a young person. \n\nValvular disease\nThis is the part with an obvious physiologic correlate that medical schools and board exams like to hammer on. Aortic regurgitation (a.k.a. aortic insufficiency) is the primary valvular disease associated with increased pulse pressure. That's because the incompetent aortic valve allows part of the blood to flow back into the left ventricle during diastole. If the aorta has access to the ventricle as it relaxes during diastole, the ventricle acts as a pressure sink, resulting in lower systemic pressures during that phase, increasing pulse pressure.\nThe converse of this is aortic stenosis, which is a valve that doesn't let adequate blood through during systole. Because the flow is less, the pumping ventricle does not change the pressure in the systemic circulation as much as it normally would.\nThis physiology text does a pretty good job explaining the valvular pathology in more detail.\n\nPulse pressure as a predictor of cardiovascular disease \nThere is extensive literature addressing the question of whether pulse pressure is a (semi-) independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, beyond that provided by systolic or diastolic pressure alone. I provide a few references below. The upshot is that the relationship between pulse pressure and risk is complicated and highly age-dependent. A high pulse pressure may be a better predictor of cardiovascular events than systolic pressure itself among the elderly.\n\n*Removed \"too\" because this just isn't well defined.\n\n\n\nFranklin SS, Gustin W 4th, Wong ND, Larson MG, Weber MA, Kannel WB, Levy D.

However, there have been studies that suggest that wisdom may not be entirely correct.\nFor example, Genuis et al. found that some toxic elements were preferentially excreted in sweat, including elements that were not found in blood serum. That suggests those elements are bound in tissues and therefore not readily removed by the liver and kidneys. \nThey conclude that:\n\nSweat analysis should be considered as an additional method for\n  monitoring bioaccumulation of toxic elements in humans.\n\nNote that they do not conclude that sweating plays a significant role in toxin elimination. \nNote also that the sample size in this study was very small, and the author has numerous publications based on this single study.\nA literature review of the subject found support for the idea that certain toxins are excreted in sweat, sometimes in higher concentrations than urine. They also noted as Genuis did that concentrations of some elements can be found in sweat that aren't detected in plasma.\n\nIn individuals with higher exposure or body burden, sweat generally\n  exceeded plasma or urine concentrations, and dermal could match or\n  surpass urinary daily excretion. Arsenic dermal excretion was\n  severalfold higher in arsenic-exposed individuals than in unexposed\n  controls. Cadmium was more concentrated in sweat than in blood plasma.\n\nWhat I cannot find is research showing that sweating produces any clinically significant benefit. Just because a compound can be found in sweat does not necessarily mean that sweating more will have a beneficial effect, and in fact no benefit to excessive sweating is known while there are known negative consequences, including potentially lethal ones.\nI conclude from my research that the question can't be answered at this time, but there is sufficient evidence to justify additional research. I suspect that the most likely outcome will be new and/or improved testing methods rather than treatment methods.\n", "blood - How can mercury be removed from the body \"naturally\"?": "\nApparently the body does remove mercury naturally:\n\nSixty days after the amalgam removal, the Hg levels in blood, plasma, and urine had declined to approximately 60% of the pre-removal levels.

So brushing immediately after eating is a bad idea, no matter what you've eaten, because the acidity will temporarily weaken the enamel. \nBrush lightly\nI believe you can brush too hard, and I've heard that brushing should be more like a gentle tickle, without forcing the brush against your teeth, but I think this is hard to get across, as it is rather subjective. The very term 'brushing' also refers to activities that require physical effort and involve forcing things to move, eg brushing the floor or brushing your hair straight, so I'm not surprised if people over do it. Television has also been flooded with toothbrush adverts over the years, which normally contain an animation illustrating particles being 'brushed off' the tooth, and this gives the impression that some force is required.\nAlso, use a toothbrush with soft bristles. \nDon't rinse\nIf you rinse your mouth immediately after brushing, most of the residual toothpaste will be washed out completely, but if you don't rinse then the active ingredients are given a bit longer to help clean your teeth. \nUse a circular action \nIf you use a small circular action when you brush, then you'll increase the contact of the bristles with the gaps between your teeth, and the circular motion can help to ease out little bits. If you simply move the toothbrush over and along the teeth, there will be less contact with the gaps.   \n", "eye - Is Low Blue Light helpful for preserving eyesight?": "\nThere are two mechanisms of action how light affect humans discussed here:\n\nAmount of energy: shorter (blue) wavelengths are more energetic than lower (red), so it can be assumed that they damage photoreceptors more.\nPsychological: bluish light is associated with day by our biochemistry. Higher amounts of bluish light makes our brains more awake (e.g. suppressing production of melatonin)\n\nPoint 1 leaves conclusion that reducing amount of blue light from the monitor is always a good thing, while point 2 means that it's helpful as you plan to go to sleep. From my experience I can say that #2 is very true, as dim and warm light in the workplace made me sleepy and inefficient. Changing light sources to bright and cool fluorescent lights helped a lot. Also I've installed RGB led lighting in my living room and discovered that using only red light at the end of the day makes falling asleep easier. Just looking at BenQ's idea it certainly appeals to me.\nHowever, the purpose of a monitor is to reproduce colors accurately. The question remains if the amount of blue can be reduced without affecting either color balance or just lowering brightness altogether. Modern \"white\" LEDs commonly used as source of light in LCD monitors are primarily blue light sources with some yellow phosphorus thrown in to balance out main emission. If BenQ used different kind of LEDs of CCFLs (less bluish) then this technology could not be turned on and off, much less adjusted. To truly limit the amount of certain component on the fly, RGB-LEDs would have to be used as backlight (they are not used here, and I'm not aware of any affordable monitor with RGB LEDs). What is presented on the video seems like simply changing color temperature to a warmer one - which is available in almost every color monitor. Even if it's not plain old color temperature, but something more sophisticated, e.g. clamp on blue channel in gamma ramp then same effect can still be achieved in software, in graphic card's gamma settings.\nI disagree much with the video on the site you've linked. Even layman like me can easily point out errors:\n\nSaying that blue light is almost as bad as UV light just because it sits next to it on a spectrum is plain scaremongering. The biggest danger of UV comes from the fact that human eye can't see UV, so it won't close the iris to block it. The eye may \"think\" it's dark in very bright UV light and let it all in. Blue light, as part of visible spectrum, does not present this danger.\nThe picture of blue-violet going \"deep into your eye\" is laughable. It shows other parts of spectrum stop at the lens while only blue reaches retina. It's plain lie, of course. Red and green do reach the retina just as well, otherwise we wouldn't be able to perceive them.\n\nBottom line: I think that the idea of reducing amount of blue light is good, but BenQ's execution is just a marketing gimmick or not much more in the best case.\nIf you really want to considerably reduce amount of blue light coming from your monitor, I recommend changing white backgrounds to yellow ones (if you work with lots of white backgrounds). This will drastically cut blue light reaching your eyes in a way not possible when still retaining impression of whiteness. Of course, eliminating large, bright areas by using dark themes (white-on-black text) will greatly cut ALL light.\nIf you seek to reduce strain on your eyes from monitor then I agree with statement that the biggest issue is not just the amount of light coming from the monitor. The biggest factor IMHO is the difference between monitor and it's background, that is the rest of the room. Therefore never use a computer/phone/tablet in total darkness - leave some nightlight + lower brightness to match. Also don't be afraid to crank up monitor up to 11 in a sunny day. Most monitors are set up to allow easy access to brightness and contrast adjustment - exactly for this very reason. They are meant to be used every time light in the room changes.\n", "dermatology - Is using SAStid soap good for eczema skin?": "\nIt seems that SAStid contains salicylic acid. Salicylic acid a keratolytic: it helps to peel the outer layers of the thick skin (1). As so it is helpful in the treatment of warts and psoriasis (2).  \nWith eczema there is no skin thickening or dandruff. So I see no real benefits with that soap. It is obvious that when the outermost layer of your skin is peeled off it increases the loss of humidity from skin resulting to dryness. Since the most common problem with eczema is the dryness of the skin it only makes it worse (3).\n", "diet - Effects of exercise while on a fast": "\nProvided that you are healthy, not suffering from a cold, disease state or other suppression of the immune system, moderate exercise during fasting periods should not impact your health. For submaximal efforts, you may notice earlier fatigue, and there will be definite performance impacts the closer you get to maximal efforts.\nCaveat: You are still introducing an artificial state (fasted), which may have health complications. I would schedule a consult with a physician and explain your plans, and have them give you a checkup with that in mind before starting this.\nHowever, there will be some impact on the effective level of the exercise, and how well you are able to perform the exercise during the later parts of the fasting period. These changes include depression in max VO2 (Although this value is more of a performance predictor, not really a measurement metric), higher levels of free fatty acids (FFA's) in the blood, as well as a somewhat suppressed gluconeogenesis as well as a concurrent rise in fat based oxidation for energy.\nWhat this means, is that your body will (mostly) use up all muscle and hepatic (liver) glycogen storage, and will turn to fax oxidation (ketone bodies) for fuel. There is not that much difference in the lactate/pyruvate levels during this time, suggesting that the switch is adequate to fuel performing muscles. There are other short term changes in several hormone and substrate (glycogen, pyruvate, lactate, etc) levels, but these are returned to normal after resuming normal dietary intake.\nWhile not an ideal state to pursue, intermittent periods of short fasting ( < 12 hours) or even up to a few days shouldn't have any health impacts, although you may notice some performance impairment.\nThis study I was able to obtain, only the first page is freely available. This took 5 obese subjects, and in a clinical setting (hospital), underwent a 3-5 week fast, with only water and vitamin supplements for health. They showed the changes described above in hormone and substrates, with a drop in VO2 max levels at the 2 and 4 week exercise marks. There was also substantial weight loss, but that is to be expected. They showed no other adverse health effects during the prolonged fast, but to emphasize, they had adequate water intake and daily vitamin and potassium supplementation.\nAnother paper available through Dartmouth Sports looked at 12 hour fasting for Ramadan and the effect on athletic performance, and found that even in the limited fasting state, there is some performance impact. One passage stands out in the paper:\n\nAn extensive review of the older literature on the effects of \n  fasting on endurance performance was published by Arag\u00f3n-\n  Vargas.(21)\n   The conclusion of this review was that a short period \n  (24 h to 4 days) of fasting in humans resulted in a decreased \n  capacity to perform endurance exercise. In spite of a rather \n  consistent effect of fasting, however, there was no clear evi-\n  dence as to the mechanism responsible for the earlier onset of \n  fatigue.\n\nThat is corroborated by other sections in the paper, one detailing performance impacts on cycling at 100% VO2 max level after 24 hours fast, and impacts on high intensity events such as the 100m and 800m runs. Interestingly, one section shows no difference in muscle glycogen stores in the absence of exercise during fasting.\n\nThere may be some effect of a reduction in the muscle \n  glycogen store on the maximal rates of muscle glycogenol-\n  ysis with a consequent loss of exercise performance dur-\n  ing high-intensity exercise, but a few days of fasting in \n  the absence of exercise has little effect on muscle glycogen \n  content.(18)\n\nThey do postulate that because of the metabolic acidosis that starts rising with prolonged fast is part of the reason for early fatigue in exercise, which is interesting.\nThe second paper also has 57 cited studies relating to exercise in a fasted state.\n", "toxicity - Is it safe to cook in Corelle/Vitrelle on 250 degrees celsius?": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to improve this post?

Protein coagulates and water evaporates as the temperature rises, and if it is too high the whole thing oxidises, and what will be left will unoxidisable ash and unburnt carbon.\nIn short, yes it is the heat injury in lightning. But in electrocution, there can be other causes such as cardiac arrhythmia, because the amount of voltage need not necessarily be high enough to oxidise everything up. \n", "medications - Do anti-inflammatory painkillers speed up healing?": "\nIt has been long known that use of NSAID have an effect for bone healing after fractures (1). Therefore the use of NSAIDs is recommended only for certain period after fracture and long-term use should be avoided.\nNSAIDs are either non-selective COX1 and COX2 inhibitors (ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen) or modern selective COX2 inhibitors (selecoxib, parecoxib). There is some evidence that non-selective COX1&2 inhibitors such as ibuprofen have a positive effect for the healing of tendons (2)(3). In general the use of NSAIDs are useful in the treatment of ligament injuries but whether the advantage of NSAIDs is due to the matter that reduction in pain results to early mobilization and thus earlier recovery is still controversial (4).\nHowever, the use of selective COX-2 inhibitors is shown to have adverse effect on the tissue healing (4)(5).\nAs so, the use of ibuprofen does not look like disadvantageous with regard to tissue healing unless where are dealing with bone fracture.\nOf course, whether there is really an objective soft tissue damage present after a whiplash is a whole another matter....\n", "infection - How accurate is testing for HSV-2?": "\nMost viruses can be in your body with no indications or current antibodies to detect\nViruses live inside your cells, if they stay there they are very hard to detect, but may also do no damage, so they are generally not a problem\nWhile some medical organisations may claim they can detect a virus from blood test, there is no 100% guarantee, especially if it not currently causing as antibody reaction\nFor HSV specifically, the antibody tests are known not to be 100% accurate. The main failure is for lack of detection, not for false positive. See oxford journals\nMany people get HSV (1 or 2), have one minor reaction, which they may not even notice, and that's it for the rest of their live, no further issues. Only a small percentage of the population have continual issues. This applies to many other viruses\nYou can probably also say that close to 100% of people will carry the HSV virus by their time of death. So don't worry about it\nIf you have active sores from HSV, treat them, and avoid behaviour that would spread them\n...\"Unlike love, Herpes is forever\"\n", "hearing - Why Do Ears Ache After Using Earmuffs": "\nThe problem can be down to the hearing protection level of the earmuffs compared to the earplugs and the pain is the result of the noise hurting your ears.  Different hearing protective devices can have different protection levels.\nTo select the right hearing protection for you, you may want to look at Cooper Safety's Webpage and read up on the information on NRR values. Specifically, the section on How does NRR change decibels of exposure? They also list on the page, typical sound levels in decibels (dB) of various sounds in order for you to estimate the dB levels you want to cancel out.\nYou said your earmuffs have a NRR of 25dB.  Looking at what Cooper Safety highlights, that means they will reduce the noise level by 9dB (not 25dB) and a lawnmower or blower will have a noise level of around 90-100dB so NRR of 25dB is nowhere near enough.\nI wish you luck in your search for something which is right for you.\n", "sleep - Can long term sleeping at day damage your health?": "\nWell regular sleeping during the day might damage health. Try avoiding it if possible as research has been conducted which suggests that there is a linkage between irregular sleep and hormone production.\nEvidence also suggests that lack of sleep won't do you as much damage as irregular or day sleep. I suggest try changing your profession. If that isn't possible due to personal or social reasons then I'd say try adjusting your shift so you can sleep at night.\nErratic sleep is bad no matter what. While you might be able to reduce the effects bit napping at night, it won't make much difference.\nYou have Vitamin D deficiency because of lack of exposure to sunlight and pills and taking walk in the sunlight can fix that easily.\nGrowth Hormone deficiency does as a matter of fact effect your sleeping pattern and vice versa. I don't know your age neither am I a doctor but assuming you are young enough, this can be fixed by medical help and change in habits.\n\n...shifted sleep appears to disrupt gene activity even more than not getting enough sleep, according to the research.\n\nIn a study published in PNAS, 22 young, healthy subjects were tested in a sleep lab. Interrupting their sleep so that their longest period of sleep was from noon until about 6:30 p.m., they found\n\nOn the days of shifted sleep... the number of genes tied to the body's clock dropped dramatically, to 228 genes, or only 1 percent of genes analyzed. ...The researchers estimated that the sleep disruptions would ultimately impact about a third of a person's genes.\n\nThis is significantly more than found in studies done on sleep deprivation.\n\n\"We think that may be related to the negative health outcomes associated with long-term shift work,\" Dijk said. Shift workers are at higher risk for many health problems, including obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, disrupted menstrual cycles and cancer, he said.\n\nSOURCE: WebMD\nGrowth hormone deficient children have a significant decrease in total sleep time, efficiency, movement and in non-rapid eye movement sleep stage 2.\n", "dermatology - Is herpes simplex/cold sore on the thigh considered a sexually transmitted disease?": "\nIt is not possible to tell what actions led to the thigh infection, because there are multiple possible actions that could.\nExplanation: Close bodily contact of any kind can transmit herpes.  That is, the virus jumps from an infected person to another person by close bodily contact (i.e. rubbing of some type).  \nIf someone was engaged in a sexual act with you and rubbed an infected part of their skin on your thigh, then, yes, your infection would be considered a sexually transmitted infection.  \nIf your lesion is reasonably far from the genital area, however, it's more likely to be an instance of herpes gladiotorum, which is a sports disease, not a sexual disease.  Wrestlers, rugby players (in a scrum), and so on, engage in very close physical contact, and this can lead to spread of herpes from one person to another through a non-sexual route.\nAs a child, you may not have been playing rugby, but you might have been wrestling with an infected friend, or the friend may have bit you on the thigh, or who knows what.  Where your friend got infected, or how, is of lesser importance.\nIf it has not come back since the original appearance, I would not worry about it.  Could you as a child really tell a herpes vesicle from a bug bite?  Could you as an adult?\n", "digestion - When, if ever, should one use a laxative?": "\nLaxatives can be of multiple types - from simple dietary roughage to some OTC mineral oils to prescription intestinal stimulants, there are simply a wide range of substances that can loosen stools and increase bowel movements. \nWhen should one take a laxative? I would say everyday. Dietary fibres are very good laxatives in normal individuals. Any diet should include plenty of dietary fibres. They also reduce the risk of colorectal carcinomas and reduce cholesterol and are all the more reasons to include in the diet - especially in the western population. For someone who follows a regular food habit and is generally healthy there won't be any reason to take anything else to increase bowel movements. So in short, dietary fibres(roughage) should be your everyday laxative. \nIf you are acutely constipated for some reason, and is making you miserable, and do not have any other symptoms(such as vomiting, abdominal pain, blood in stool, etc) then you can take an over the counter laxative for one day and see if it resolves the issue. That can be simple mineral oil, castor oil, Isapghula, etc. If a single dose of any of those does not improve your costipation, then you should consult a doctor. The doctor can look at the cause of constipation and prescribe a medicine for you appropriately for a short duration of time. Some people who take certain pills (opiod narcotics for example) are likely to be chronically constipated. In that case one may have to use laxatives for a long duration of time, but that decision is taken by a doctor. \nThe reason why it is not recommended to take a laxative for a long duration of time without a good reason is that some laxatives reduce cause colonic tissues to wear out over time and make the patient permanently consipated(laxative gut) There is also the risk of reduced nutrient absorption, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, intestinal paralysis, irritable bowel syndrome, factitious diarrhea, etc. So chronic use of stimulant laxatives should be avoided whenever possible. \n", "renal - Body's response to rapid ingestion of water?": "\nI don't belive it is possible for the body to produce too much ADH.  The body will likely produce insufficient ADH to eliminate the ingested water, thus you will still remain in a state of hyponatremia even after the body's ADH response.\nThe body will then return to homeostatus by reducing thirst.\nThis means of course that if you ingest too much water (ignoring your lack of thirst) you can create serious health problems for yourself.\n", "side effects - How does anxiety and stress affect the bowels?": "\nOne\u2019s mental state has a major effect on bowel function. In fact, there is a high correlation between IBS and stress. \nGiven the high levels of anxiety and stress commonly seen in patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, evidence suggests that the syndrome may be linked to a disruption of the stress system. The stress response in the body involves the sympathetic nervous system which has been shown to operate abnormally in IBS patients.\nIn an article by Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, scientists are inferring that \u2018the little brain\u2019, or enteric nervous system (ENS) is the link between what's going on in the gut and it's effect on the brain, or the relationship between digestion and mood.\n\nAnxiety and depression have been thought to contribute to gastro conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n\nJay Pastricha, MD, Director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Neurogastroenterology states that the main role of the ENS is:\n\n\"...controlling digestion, from swallowing to the release of enzymes that break down food, to the control of blood flow that helps with nutrient absorption to elimination.\"\n\nAs described in Human Physiology: An Integrated Approach, when your sympathetic nervous system is activated by a stressful event, for example, it initiates a \u201cfight or flight\u201d response -- a mechanism that primes the body for action, particularly in situations that threaten survival. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system causes vasoconstriction of most blood vessels, including those in the digestive tract. Because the blood vessels in the gastrointestinal organs constrict, the digestive tract will inhibit peristalsis (digestion) and result in a variety of GI symptoms.\nThe GI tract is generally sensitive to emotion in most people (even those who do not have IBS) as anger, anxiety, sadness, and elation (among others) can all trigger symptoms in the gut. For example, you've likely heard or even spoken the words \"going with your gut\" when making a decision or feeling like you have \"butterflies in your stomach\" when feeling nervous. In people who suffer from IBS however, the ENS may trigger big emotional shifts which can lead to functional bowel problems such as constipation, diarrhea, bloating, pain, and stomach upset. \nPeople with IBS can experience either constipation, diarrhea, or both depending on the individual and how their emotionally triggered symptoms present. According to Mayo Clinic: \n\nFor the purpose of treatment, IBS can be divided into three types based on your symptoms: constipation-predominant (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D), or mixed.\n\nResearch also suggests that digestive system activity may affect cognition (thinking skills and memory). As explained by a Harvard Health article:\n\nThe brain has a direct effect on the stomach. A troubled intestine can send signals to the brain, just as a troubled brain can send signals to the gut. Therefore, a person\u2019s stomach or intestinal distress can be the cause or the product of anxiety, stress, or depression.\n\nIn an effort to provide further evidence in response to \"How does your mental state actually affect the functioning of the bowel?\":\nPsychological factors influence the actual physiology of the gut, as well as presenting symptoms. As it relates to IBS, stress can affect movement and contractions of the GI tract or can increase inflammation. Additionally, people with IBS may perceive pain more acutely than other people do because their brains do not properly regulate pain signals from the GI tract. When faced with a stress-causing event, the existing pain can feel worse. As stated in the article, 'The Brain-Gut Connection': \n\nIrritation in the gastrointestinal system may send signals to the CNS that trigger mood changes, which is why a higher than normal percentage of people with IBS and other bowel disorders develop depression and anxiety. \n\n", "eye - Are there behavioral causes for myopia?": "\nI think there's  a link, but no one can say that this is the cause of myopia\nAccording to American Optometric Association : \n\nThe exact cause of nearsightedness is unknown, but two factors may be primarily responsible for its development: Heredity and Visual Stress\n\n\nEven though the tendency to develop nearsightedness may be inherited, its actual development may be affected by how a person uses his or her eyes. Individuals who spend considerable time reading, working at a computer, or doing other intense close visual work may be more likely to develop nearsightedness.\n\nAlso :\n\nSome people may experience blurred distance vision only at night. This \u201cnight myopia\u201d may be due to the low level of light making it difficult for the eyes to focus properly or the increased pupil size during dark conditions, allowing more peripheral, unfocused light rays to enter the eye.\nPeople who do an excessive amount of near vision work may experience a false or \u201cpseudo\u201d myopia. Their blurred distance vision is caused by over use of the eyes\u2019 focusing mechanism. After long periods of near work, their eyes are unable to refocus to see clearly in the distance. The symptoms are usually temporary and clear distance vision may return after resting the eyes. However, over time constant visual stress may lead to a permanent reduction in distance vision.\nSymptoms of nearsightedness may also be a sign of variations in blood sugar levels in persons with diabetes or an early indication of a developing cataract.\n\nNSH give us more input about your specifics questions :\n\nOne study found that children who read for 30 minutes or more each day were one-and-a-half times more likely to develop myopia than children who didn't read for this period of time.\n  Research has also shown that children who spend time doing outdoor activities, such as playing sports, are less likely to become short-sighted and existing short-sightedness may progress less quickly.\n  It is thought that this protective effect could be associated with the higher light levels outside than inside, and the fact that you are not constantly focusing on near objects.\n  An \"everything in moderation\" approach is recommended. Although children should be encouraged to read, they should also spend some time away from reading and computer games each day doing outdoor activities.\n\nThat being said, since most of studies link this cause of effect on developing eye's, i don't think this could make your myopia worse after you is past 21 years old and your eye's is completely grown.\n", "decibels - Looking for research data for amount of hearing loss resulting from otitis media with effusion (OME)": "\nOtitis media with effusion (OME) is most common in young children (under 2) making studying the effects on hearing difficult. While newborn hearing screening is common, it does not provide a full audiogram. Collecting an audiogram a a child who does not speak or understand direction and has limited attention is hard. Collecting an audiogram on a sick child is even harder. With a some serious caveat regarding sample size, Werner and Ward (1997) provide the best study on this that I am aware of. They conclude that the effect of OME is 15-30 dB (while the child is sick).\n", "lupus - Can regular immersion in cold water cause loss of hearing?": "\nIt is possible that hearing loss can be caused by cold water. Several different different types of benign growths can cause loss of hearing because they may block the ear canal. One of these types of growths are exotoses in the ear canal (aka Surfer's ear). Surfer's ear is caused by exposure to cold air or cold water. Odds are that frequent cold showers won't cause Surfer's ear, because usually the growth is caused by both cold air and cold water (doesn't always have to be cold, but it is much more likely for cold air and water to cause it than warm air and water). Extoses be treated through surgery to remove the growth (obviously this wasn't possible in the 18th and 19th century).\nIt is also possible that loss of hearing can be be caused by a condition known as Swimmer's ear which is the result of prolonged exposure of the ear to moisture and water. Things like swimming (hence the name) or routine showering can cause this, which means it may be possible for you to experience a sudden loss of hearing. This water doesn't have to be cold though. Swimmer's ear doesn't always cause loss of hearing and when it does, it is only temporary and can be treated with some medications and eardrops.\n\nExostosis of the external auditory canal\nHearing Loss Causes\nSwimmer's Ear\nSwimmer's Ear Directory\n", "vaccination - Can the HPV vaccine be effective if you are already infected?": "\nThe HPV vaccine is most effective when preventing you from initial infection. While common, it's possible you haven't been infected with HPV. Even if you are, there is some benefit to still being vaccinated if you're HPV positive. The reason for this is that there are a number of different types of HPV virus, and the vaccine should provide you some protection against types you have not already acquired. From this MMWR report, \"Human Papillomavirus Vaccination: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices\":\n\nIn the phase III trials, among females aged 16\u201326 years who had HPV\n  vaccine type DNA detected at study enrollment (either seropositive or\n  seronegative), there was no efficacy against progression to disease or\n  impact on clearance of infection of that type (114,120). However, HPV4\n  had 100% efficacy for prevention of CIN2+ attributable to types not\n  already acquired (120). Among persons seropositive to the relevant HPV\n  type but HPV DNA-negative, too few cases were detected to evaluate\n  efficacy, but disease incidence was low and all cases occurred in the\n  placebo group.\n\nand\n\nHPV vaccination can provide protection against infection with HPV\n  vaccine types not already acquired. Therefore, vaccination is\n  recommended through the recommended age for females regardless of\n  whether they have an abnormal Pap test result, and for females or\n  males regardless of known HPV infection, HPV-associated precancer\n  lesions, or anogenital warts. Females who have abnormalities on\n  cervical cancer screening are likely to be infected with one or more\n  genital HPV types. With increasing severity of Pap test findings, the\n  likelihood of infection with HPV 16 or HPV 18 increases (70), and the\n  expected benefit of vaccination decreases. Females who have had HPV\n  testing as part of cervical cancer screening might have information\n  about their HPV status. Males or females with AIN are likely infected\n  with HPV. The presence of anogenital warts or a history of anogenital\n  warts indicates present or past infection with HPV, most often HPV 6\n  or HPV 11. Although vaccination is still recommended, patients should\n  be advised that vaccination will not have any therapeutic effect on an\n  existing HPV infection, HPV-associated precancer lesion, cancer, or\n  anogenital warts.\n\nIn short: It is likely still worth getting vaccinated to protect you from other strains of HPV.\n", "endocrinology - What is normal range of Anti TPO antiodies test?": "\nThere are several reasons why we can't specify the range here on Health SE, especially for anti-TPO Ab.\n\nThe test method\n\nAntibodies are proteins, produced by our immune system. Determining the concentration of a specific protein is somewhat more difficult than determining the concentration of a smaller molecule. Still, there are various methods for this - for antibodies those are mostly immunological assays.\nIf you test the same sample with various methods, you could get different results.\nFrom Lab Tests Online:\n\nThe sensitivity and specificity of thyroid antibody testing is improving but is still not as good as health practitioners would like it to be. All of the thyroid antibody tests have changed over time. This is part of the reason that the tests have historically acquired many different names. There are also many distinct methodologies and each has different reference (normal) ranges. If someone is having serial testing done for monitoring purposes, it is best to have test done by the same laboratory each time, using the same methodology.\n\nHow can you trust these tests if they give different results? Each test method has to be validated and standardised. This means that various parameters (that have been determined as important) are checked for each method against a standard or a referent method. The important thing is that one interprets the value obtained by testing a certain sample by a certain method by comparing it to the referent range for that method.\n\nDemographics\n\nFrom the same source:\n\nReference values are dependent on many factors, including patient age, sex, sample population, and test method, and numeric test results can have different meanings in different labs.\nFor these reasons, you will not find reference ranges for the majority of tests described on this web site. The lab report containing your test results should include the specific reference range for your test(s).\n\nThis is pretty straight forward. E.g. if there are variations between sexes, the lab report should come with two referent ranges (one for each sex), and specify which is which. Sample population is also important, and some referent ranges are defined for the majority population living in a certain area.\n\nThe units\n\nIf somebody told me that their body temperature is 97 degrees, I'd say that's impossible. This is because I'm used to Celsius scale, where water boils at 100 degrees Celsius. In fact, this calculator shows that 97.16 degrees Fahrenheit corresponds to 36.2 degrees Celsius, which is within normal body temperature range. Same goes for determining concentration - there are many \"types\" of concentrations (molar, mass, etc.) and each of these can be expressed in various units. Furthermore, the amount/level of the tested parameter doesn't have to be a concentration at all.\nConclusion 1: If you have your test results, they should have come with units and reference ranges (usually written in a column at the right of the report). If you don't have these, it might be a good idea to contact the test lab if possible and inquire for details.\n\nInterpretation\n\nIf the results are not within the reference range, this can mean a number of things. It might imply that there is an underlying condition causing this. For thyroid, the values of TSH and anti-TPO Ab can point to several, very different conditions. You shouldn't try to discern these on your own - even if you have referent ranges. This is what doctors are for. You should not expect a physician to interpret these results via phone or e-mail, because laboratory tests are just one part of making a correct diagnosis. Other parts include: anamnesis, family anamnesis (medical history of your relatives), physical examination and possibly (but not necessarily) imaging methods, such as ultrasound.\nWhat's more, even within a certain referent range, for some hormones it depends very much on your age e.g. in which part of the interval are the \"ideal\", i.e. optimal values.\nConclusion 2: Leave the interpretation and the diagnosis to your doctor.\n\nSuggested reading: Reference Ranges and What They Mean\n\nAn aside: determining TSH values is more straightforward, but still various sources give different referent ranges: 1:  0.4 - 4.0 mIU/L and 2: 0.5-6 uU/ml.\n", "exercise - When doing static (traditional \"lean and hold\" type of stretching), how long should we hold the stretch?": "\nThe general consensus on the internet and among various physical trainers is that static stretching in 20-30 second segments is sufficient to increase range of motion (ROM) in a muscle. This is corroborated by two studies (Very similar in nature, conducted by the same people), where one study showed that there was no difference when time was increased from 30 to 60 seconds and performed multiple times per day, and another that showed no gains when solely increasing from 30-60 seconds per stretch.\nHowever, if your goal is to increase flexibility, then you may want to also look at adding proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) type stretching once or twice a week. The most basic form of this is to get into a stretch, and then isometrically contract (joint/muscle stay static, rather than moving) against the stretch. This is, however, an advanced stretching technique and should only be done after proper instruction. This study showed that PNF stretching also was the only one that produced performance enhancement.\nBallistic stretching (lean and bounce) type stretching has been much maligned, and is still contraindicated because of the tendency towards producing injury. (It tends to activate the stretch reflex in muscles and produce tears/strains). However, there is some indication that it may aid in jumping type performances.\nTL;DR\nDynamic stretching before workouts (active movement that mimics the motions of the sport), and static stretching after (30 seconds, and I personally do a stretch and hold, relax, repeat even deeper type of cycle for each muscle) produce some of your best gains for the typical everyday person. PNF can get even greater gains if needed. However, it has not been proven yet (Despite claims) that any type of stretching produces better injury prevention or reduces muscle soreness after workouts. Also, static stretching before performance has been shown to negatively impact performance.\n", "medications - Will an increased dosage of Quetiapine increase somnolence?": "\nSeroquel (quetiapine) is quite well known to cause perhaps the most sedation among all the drugs in the 'atypical antipsychotic' class of medication due to its strong histamine and alpha receptor antagonism.\nIn fact, although there is much controversy surrounding this, Seroquel is being prescribed more often as an 'off-label' treatment for insomnia due to the strong sedative effects of the drug. This is somewhat controversial due to the wide ranging effects of the drug and a possible alteration to REM sleep.\nIt certainly stands to reason that higher doses of a drug causes more side effects. This is generally termed 'dose-related' or 'dose-dependent' side effects.\nPublished information for quetiapine does reveal that somnolence is most likely dose-related, but it's not all that significant.\nIn a clinical trial for the drug for the treatment of schizophrenia in children aged 13-17, the prescribing information for Seroquel states:\n\nAdverse events that were potentially dose-related with higher frequency in the 600 mg group compared to the 400 mg\n  group included somnolence (50% vs. 57%), nausea (6% vs. 10%) and tachycardia (6% vs. 9%). \n\nAdditionally, the prescribing information for Seroquel XR has the following chart:\n\nSo, it certainly does seem that higher doses of Seroquel do cause a higher incidence of somnolence, but it doesn't appear to be a huge difference between doses.\n", "drug metabolism - What effect does long-term caffeine use have on memory?": "\nThere are actually quite a lot of studies pointing in all directions when it comes to memory and caffeine use. I wouldn't call it a closed case by any standard, although many sites hawk caffeine as a great improver of memory, especially long-term memory.\nSome studies showing no effects of long-term caffeine use on memory:\n\nHameleers et al. (2000): A large number of adults (1875) ranging in age from 21 to 84 were studied while consuming caffeine over long periods of time. Even after compensation for various medical and sociological factors, no effects on short-term memory were observed. The sheer amount of data gathered is one thing in favor of this study, as outliers would not have influenced the result.\nHerz (1999): A large number of subjects were studied while undergoing certain sessions containing cognitive tasks. No effects on memory were observed from caffeine usage.\nWarburton (1995): Low doses of caffeine were used on subjects over an extended period of time. There were non-negligible mood changes, but no effects on working memory. Note that this study focused in part on caffeine deprivation, rather than giving subjects additional caffeine.\n\nSome studies showing positive effects of long-term caffeine use on memory:\n\nAngelucci et al. (2002): A group of rats (not humans!) was studied, given caffeine injections at various points during training. They were then given the Morris water maze test. Some of the rats were able to better remember pervious sessions - as the authors put it,\n\nThese data provide evidence that caffeine improves memory retention but not memory acquisition, explaining some discrepancies among reports in the literature.\n\n\nBeydoun et al. (2014): Caffeine and alcohol use and diet were studied simultaneously in a large group of subjects. The findings were mixed, although some evidence was found supporting the hypothesis that caffeine use can increase overall cognitive function in older adults.\n\nSome studies showing negative effects of long-term caffeine use on memory:\n\nHan et al. (2007): Subjects were studied over four weeks while using low doses of caffeine. A slight decrease in memory function was observed, caused in part by inhibition of part of the hippocampus.\n\nI haven't shown the same amount of studies in all three categories - neutral, positive, and negative - and that's by design. There is a substantial amount of studies that found no significant effects, and that much more research would be needed to give strong evidence for long-term benefits. There is a decent amount of studies showing some positive long-term benefits, and almost none showing negative long-term benefits.\nTherefore, I don't think it's safe to go in any of the three directions. However, it does seem like the effects of long-term caffeine use may be negligible.\nAlso, be careful to differentiate between long-term effects of caffeine on memory and the effects of caffeine on long-term memory! Studies often cover both, because studying subjects over only a few days won't tell you much about long-term memory (certainly not about acquisition, at least). However, they aren't the same thing.\n", "What would life expectancy be today without medicine and surgery?": "\nYour question is too big to be answered with a formal analysis.  So here is a back of the envelope assessment:\n[A] We are worse off today (vs. 1900) because of:\n\ntobacco use\nobesity\niPods (every adult will be deaf in 20 years)\nmotor vehicle accidents, gun violence, immense wars\n\n[B] We are better off today (vs. 1900) because of:\n\nbetter nutrition (hunger was common in the USA even into the 1960s)\npublic health improvements (e.g. clean water, shoes for all).\nrefrigeration (stomach cancer was #1 in 1900, owing to widespread pickling of foods).\nsafer work conditions.\n\n[C] Important medical developments since 1900:\n\nantibiotics\nanti-tuberculous medicines\nhypertension control\nvaccines\ninfant mortality\neverything else is rounding error\n\n[D] Not a factor:\n\ngenes\nalcohol (bad, but probably same vs. 1900)\n\nSo, life in 2015 = C + B - A.  Your question is whether B - A is better than life in 1900.  \nComparing survival curves, the biggest change in survival is the huge improvement in living to age 5.\n\n20% of people dead by age 5 (USA whites, 1900)\n8% of people dead by age 5 (USA whites, 1930)\n5% of people dead by age 5 (USA whites, 1940)\n40% of people dead by age 5 (British India, 1921-1930)\n\nIf you look at the curves from 1900 vs. 1940, there is not that much difference once the initial large difference is subtracted.  I was too lazy to go looking for more recent curves, but I doubt it would be much different.  The median survival in 1940 was 70 years for USA whites.\nI do not think this early life difference can be explained by an improvement in medical care.  It was public health, i.e. improved living conditions (including adequate food).\nYou can find interesting historical survival curves in the book Ageing: The Biology of Senescence, 1964.\n", "cognitive science - What is this noise I see when I close my eyes?": "\nYou are seeing phosphenes.\nThese have been described in medical notes for thousands of years\nThey are assumed to be caused by random firing of optic nerves due to stray electrical stimulation in the brain, or pressure on the eye\nOther causes are; sudden changes in air pressure, moving from bright light outside into a dark room, violent body motions (like coughing or sneezing), over stimulation (sexual, drugs, grief), diabetic shock, violent sports (boxing, rugby etc); all these may cause pressure on the eye, or over stimulation of the bodies electrical system\nIf you are getting increased phosphenes, bright flashes of light, or fixed objects appearing with your eyes closed, these may be a sign of eye nerve damage, and a trip to the doctor may be a good idea\nInterestingly, this is similar to the CCD device in a camera chip.

When doctors advise to avoid junk food, what does that mean?": "\nJunk food is a somewhat generic term that basically includes calories from food that has no real nutritional value, or is so loaded with artificial flavors, added sugars/fats that it overwhelms the nutritional value that was there.\nMany of the items on your list could be considered junk food, depending on how they are eaten, how much and how often.\nFor example, a Domino's thick crust pizza with pepperoni, sausage, extra cheese is loaded with saturated fats, lots of calories for not a lot of substance. However, you could get a thin crust pizza with a light amount of cheese, green peppers, mushrooms and black olives, and while still not the best of foods would be a much better option.\nSame for fruit juice - If you get a pure juice such as a squeezed orange juice with no additives, it will be much better than a cranberry juice from extract with added sugar.\nAlso, as noted in this WebMD article on junk food, these foods tend to be less satiating, that is they satisfy hunger much less than \"real\" foods, so that you typically end up eating more of them to satisfy hunger, which in turn leads to higher caloric intake.\nOther items, such as the chocolate, spring roll may not be the best (Depending on what is in the spring roll), but in little bits are ok. It's very hard to eat a clean diet, especially if you are busy, but with some planning and cooking ahead, you can make a diet very healthy, and still leave room for some items like chocolates, candies. \nAs long as the junk food is limited in intake, and doesn't make up the majority of the diet (As a personal rule, I try to limit \"junk\" calories to no more than 10% of my weekly intake), a little bit should be fine.\nHowever, in light of this being a doctor's recommendation, and given the lab values in your other question, it might be a good idea to have a consultation with a dietitian/nutritionist to help create an achievable, healthy eating plan.\n", "exercise - Does the heart become stronger or weaker after an intensive workout?": "\nWe are looking at ventricular hypertrophy here. \nThe human heart has a left and a right side. On both sides there are a ventricle and an atrium (1) (2). Basically the heart is just a bulk of muscle tissue responsible for circulation and blood flow.\nAs with any muscle contraction when there is a resistance against the working muscle this leads to muscle growth or hypertrophy. A bad example of such resistance is a high blood pressure. Due to the elevated blood pressure, the heart must pump and contract against a continuously present counter force and this leads to a heart muscle hypertrophy, or ventricular hypertrophy (3). When hypertrophy is due to, say, high blood pressure this hypertrophy or growth is pathological and eventually leads to muscle stiffness and heart failure.\nIn your case, there is probably also some heart muscle hypertrophy but it is non-pathologic and it can be considered as a healthy \"heart condition\". The principle is the same. When you workout your heart must work more efficiently compared to its resting state and pump more blood to the skeletal muscles due to increased demand for oxygen. Due to the advantageous heart muscle growth your heart is capable of circulating blood more efficiently. \n\nWhether the heart muscle growth is pathologic or non-pathologic depends on the concept of afterload (4). In a healthy heart the afterload is minimal indicating that the heart \"can rest\" shortly after ejection or ventricular contraction. This results to beneficial hypertrophy. However, if a substantial afterload is present, which is the case in elevated blood pressure, the heart \"can't rest\" after contraction but instead is must maintain some level of muscle contraction which results in adverse muscle hypertrophy.\nHowever, in extreme cases the workout can result in some health issues, called an athletic heart syndrome (5).  This is still far less adverse than heart failure.\n", "Does sitting idle for one month without work lead to depression?": "\nI've suffered from depression quite a few years in my life. One basic long-term cause I have found is my basic worldview - whether I see reality as fundamentally \"good\" or \"bad\". This takes a long time to improve.\nBut in the short term, I find my feelings strongly influenced by my ability to effectively respond to what life has brought along. If I set twenty goals and fail at all in a row, I tend to feel pretty low, whereas if I succeed then I tend to feel alright. When I advise students beginning research in chemistry, for example, I suggest that if they start to get frustrated to go \"wash the dishes\". This is helpful because washing the glassware is an activity where success is very likely, whereas chemical research can be fraught with disappointments easily beyond the ability of a novice (or even expert) chemistry student to predict.\nWhat we are seeing here is a phenomenon called learned helplessness. Since it affects rodents it should come as no surprise that it affects us too. All it amounts to is a basic learning process that generalizes recent failure at a particular task to be a reduced ability to accomplish all tasks. Unlike rodents, though, we have the advantage of seeing through reason that the depressed feelings are unjustified, and acting out of reason in spite of how we feel. Students with difficult or impossible chemistry research assignments can still know themselves as competent chemists and worthwhile people.\nIt could also be burn out. How long have you been at the same computer-related occupation? I've been an application developer for the last ten years myself, but my life is full of other activities outside of work. Your desire to be outside may be your healthy need for a variety of activities. This would be a good time to go camping. It sounds like you are ready for a career change too, but you will need peace of mind and vision to lead you to the next one. That's my main advice - do what it takes to relax so you can reflect and know what to do.\n", "medications - Maximum dose of olanzapine": "\nThe manufacturer\u2019s prescribing information (a.k.a. package insert) provides recommended dosing based on safety and efficacy data obtained during the drug development and approval process.

In the portion of the PI discussing safety data, it refers to the \u201cmaximum\u201d dose as 20 mg/day. \nThere have been reports of using up to 60 mg daily in cases of treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but this is rare and the data supporting it are weak.1 \nIn the course of normal clinical practice, including care of many psychiatric patients on atypical antipsychotics, I have never seen doses above 20 mg daily used.

By far the largest part of upper airway infections are viral and the body is very capable of clearing them up.\nIt is a common misconception that that the colour of the mucus gives information about whether it is viral or bacterial. This study shows that the sensitivity of yellowish or greenish sputum used as a test for a bacterial infection was 0.79 (95% CI 0.63\u20130.94); the specificity was 0.46  (95% CI 0.038\u20130.53), which is very low.\nA visit to your doctor for a cold is almost never necessary. Even in the case that there is a bacterial infection, your body can almost always get rid of it itself. This Cochrane review concludes that in acute, uncomplicated rhinosinusitis (which is, essentially, what we call \"a cold\") there is no place for antibiotics. It may cause the cold to be over faster than it would be without antibiotics, but without the antibiotics there is a very very low rate of complications. Antibiotics cause adverse events and resistance of bacteria, so they should not be used without reason. \nAs there is no reason for antibiotics, a visit to your doctor will also not be useful.\nA subsequent upper airway infection with coughing is often caused by something called post-nasal drip (essentially mucus from the nose dripping into the throat), which sucks but doesn't warrent a visit to the doctor. Signs of a possible pneumonia are: fever for >3 days or recurrent fever after a few fever-free days, dyspnea or wheezing (this is based on the Dutch guidelines so I don't have an English source for this). In this case, I would definitely recommend going to your doctor. There is still a realistic chance that you're not going to need antibiotics, but that is a decision the doctor needs to make based on the specific circumstances and this cannot be assessed over the internet.\n", "Are all kinds of liquor and alcohol equally bad for liver?": "\nThe only difference it makes to the liver how alcohol is consumed is how high the blood alcohol content becomes and for how long - the other particulars of the beverage will be filtered out by the digestion process. Beverages containing a higher alcohol content will tend to cause a higher peak blood alcohol content because they can be consumed more quickly than the same amount of alcohol in a larger volume, and the more concentrated alcohol will be absorbed from the stomach more quickly. The liver is limited in its capacity to process alcohol. Low blood concentrations of alcohol are efficiently converted into acetate and metabolized, but at high concentrations some of the alcohol is converted into toxic acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is thought to cause hangover symptoms and also contribute to liver cell death through oxidative stress (Min, JA; Lee, K; Ki, D. June 2010. The application of minerals in managing alcohol hangover: a preliminary review. Current Drug Abuse Reviews, 3(2): 110-115). Replacement of these cells leads over time to enlargement of the liver, accumulation of scar tissue (cirrhosis) and cancer. So avoiding hangover by consuming alcohol in moderation may help avoid liver damage if alcohol is consumed. It is also very important to avoid consumption of acetaminophen with alcohol because processing the alcohol prevents the liver from properly eliminating the acetaminophen, which can cause severe liver damage.\nLike the liver, the brain is also only concerned with the concentration of alcohol in the blood and how long it has been that way, in terms of how intoxication is experienced. It will take more alcohol as beer to produce the same level of intoxication as vodka because more of it will have had time to metabolize before the peak blood concentration is reached. The brain also becomes more tolerant to the effects of alcohol as time passes, so that the blood concentration has to be increased over time to maintain the same level of intoxication. So having more drinks to maintain the same experience will be harder on the liver than the initial drinks.\n", "nutrition - Should I choose low fat milk or full fat milk?": "\nFrom \"Consumption of Dairy Products in Relation to Changes in Anthropometric Variables in Adult Populations: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies\" (2016):\n\nThe current state of knowledge regarding the association of dairy products and weight gain, overweight, and obesity is based on studies reporting contradicting and inconclusive results.\n\nI recommend reading above review and reading through its bibliography.\n", "How do topical steroid withdrawal relate to adrenal insufficiency?": "\nGood question! The missing bit of information here is that topical steroids are usually not absorbed systemically at high enough levels to cause adrenal suppression. However, they sometimes are. I shall explain.\nFirst of all, regarding the relationship between systemic corticosteroid administration and adrenal insufficiency, please see this answer. The basic idea (which I think you understand) is that exogenous administration of medications that mimic cortisol (a hormone produced in the adrenal gland) suppress the body\u2019s processes for stimulating the hormone naturally. The adrenal gland atrophies due to the lack of natural stimulation. This causes a problem if the medication is suddenly withdrawn, because the body can\u2019t quickly recover the ability to produce cortisol itself. This is called adrenal insufficiency or HPA axis suppression.1 \nNow to your question:\n\nHow do topical steroid withdrawal relate to adrenal insufficiency?\n\nThe answer is that if topical steroids are absorbed into the bloodstream at high enough levels for a long enough time to suppress the HPA axis, they will cause adrenal insufficiency. Usually this degree of absorption occurs only with the use of \u201cGroup I\u201d topical steroids, the strongest ones. This list shows the different categories of topical steroids by potency. The \u201csuper-potent\u201d Group I includes:2 \n\nBetamethasone 0.05% \nClobetasol 0.05%\nDiflurasone 0.05%\nHalobetasol 0.05%\nFlucinonide 0.1%\n\nThe most important factors that determine whether or not HPA suppression will occur are the potency of the drug, the dose, and the duration of use. The Group I agents can cause significant HPA suppression if used for two or more weeks at a dose of ~2g/day. Other factors that predispose to HPA suppression include:\n\napplication to permeable areas (face, mucous membranes)\nocclusive dresssings\ncompromised skin integrity\nyoung age\n\nThe first list in your question appears to mostly outline local effects of withdrawing topical steroids. These are possible with less potent steroids and do not require systemic absorption. The second list, on the other hand, describes a syndrome of adrenal insufficiency. These are likely only the circumstances described above. \n\nNotes \n\nHPA stands for hypothalamus \u2192 pituitary \u2192 adrenal, the pathway for producing cortisol.\nList was expanded a bit from that link using Bolognia et al., below.\n\n\nReferences \nTadicherla S, Ross K, Shenefelt PD, Fenske NA.

So this is one reason why the fasting glucose is the glucose to which your body is exposed most of the time. \nBut more important, the doctors don't care for your peak glucose levels, they care for the equilibrium level of your glucose homeostasis, and that's 5 mmol or somewhere very close to it. If it is not there, then the mechanism for achieving it is broken, no matter what your postprandial glucose levels are. So both of your assumptions are incorrect. \nAnd if you are on a diet which has your blood glucose levels constantly elevated, that's a very calorie dense diet and you are probably indeed in trouble. But even then, measuring your fasting glucose is important, because the doctor cannot make any conclusions from the raised levels. \nBy the way, there is also another test for blood sugar which gives you an estimation of not the current blood sugar, but of the average blood sugar over the last few weeks. Both an elevated fasting glucose and an elevated hgb 1ac levels are diagnostic criteria for diabetes, so if you somehow managed to keep your fasting glucose low but your average glucose unreasonably high, this could be discovered and you will be diagnosed with diabetes or warned that you are in a prediabetic condition, depending on the current diagnose guidelines used in your country. But if you suspect this, you should probably inform your physician, as I don't think hgb a1c is measured in routine blood tests. \nSource: a Coursera course on diabetes I can't link because it's no longer open, sorry.

Add citations from reputable sources by editing the post. Posts with unsourced content may be edited or deleted.\r\n                        \r\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"common cold\" is a syndrome that is characterized by signs and symptoms of upper respiratory infection: sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, rhinorrhea, cough, and sinus congestion.  Malaise (the feeling of \"feeling sick\") is reported, but is generally more mild than with the flu.  Fever is uncommon with colds.  Myalgias and arthralgias (muscle and joint aches) are also reported but are typically more mild than with flu).\nThe common cold is invariably caused by viruses and more than one family of viruses is capable of producing this syndrome with varying degrees of severity and duration depending on the virus.  The best known virus family is the rhinoviridae.\nRhinovirus has at least 99 serotypes.  This presents a challenge to the body's immune system as an immune response to one serotype may not provide any protection against other serotypes.  It is possible for a person to be consecutively infected with rhinoviridae of different serotypes.  The durability of immunity to a rhinovirus strain, once established, is not known.  It remains possible that over time, a person can become susceptible to reinfection.\nBecause human adaptive immunity requires antigen exposure, there is little that someone can do on their own to \"boost\" their specific immunity against cold viruses.  There is no vaccine (so many viruses and serotypes to consider). Boosting non-specific immunity (the acute inflammatory mechanisms) is a strategy that has not been well explored, but this approach is hard to recommend.  Non-specific immunity is a two-edged sword with the potential to damage the host's own body in addition to its role as the \"first responders\" to a pathogen.\nAirborne like products. Over the counter products that purport to \"boost immunity to colds\" are largely clinically untested.  Vitamin C has been examined.  In a July 2007 study, researchers wanted to discover whether taking 200 milligrams or more of vitamin C daily could reduce the frequency, duration, or severity of a cold. After reviewing 60 years of clinical research, they found that when taken after a cold starts, vitamin C supplements do not make a cold shorter or less severe. When taken daily, vitamin C very slightly shorted cold duration.\nMost over the counter immune boosters for colds are vitamin B and C based, which makes them safe and reasonably non-toxic so their use can't be discouraged.  Therapeutic doses of water-soluble vitamins usually result in very expensive urine.\nZinc. Recently an analysis of several studies showed that zinc lozenges or syrup reduced the length of a cold by one day, especially when taken within 24 hours of the first signs and symptoms of a cold.  Studies also showed that taking zinc regularly might reduce the number of colds each year, the number of missed school days, and the amount of antibiotics required in otherwise healthy children.  Zinc can potentially have some side-effects, so you should talk to your doctor before beginning zinc supplementation.\nTLDR: Rhinoviridae is very infectious, lives outside the body for hours to days, and is readily transmitted by auto-inoculation from encounters with contaminated surfaces.  The best \"immune booster\" for colds really, truly is frequent hand-washing.\n", "Daily how much water intake is needed?": "\nThis answer is based on normal situations (examples of an abnormal situations include patrolling in high temperatures in full protective gear, and strenuous exercise, especially in heat/cold) and normal health.\nI'm going to go on record here as a renegade who does not believe in an \"8 glasses of water a day\" (1.9 L) regimen for normal healthy people in normal circumstances. My belief is, if you're thirsty, drink something; make sure at least some of the time, it's water. If you're drinking caffeinated beverages or alcohol, drink a little more water.\nMost people will disbelieve this because of the popular press's obsession with 8 8-ounce glasses (1.9 L) per day myth. So some science is in order.\nTotal water intake includes water in beverages, water in food, and water intake. Daily water needs vary depending on humidity, temperature (sweating), physical exercise etc. But normal, healthy people regulate their daily water balance incredibly well despite changes in size/development (some factors, such as dementia, etc. can interfere with hydration.) In general, as long as food and fluids are readily available, people only need to drink when they are thirsty. (Obviously strenuous exercise, illness, and other special circumstances require a different approach.)\nPeople born around the same time I was spent a large part of their lives never having seen people drink purchased water or toting bottles of water everywhere, and were probably as amused as I was to see the explosive growth of the bottled water industry.\nThe Institutes of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board issued a new report in 2004 establishing nutrient recommendations on \"water, salt and potassium to maintain health and reduce chronic disease risk\". They stated that the vast majority of healthy people adequately meet their daily hydration needs by letting thirst be their guide. In a press release:\n\n\"We don't offer any rule of thumb based on how many glasses of water people should drink each day because our hydration needs can be met through a variety of sources in addition to drinking water,\" said Lawrence Appel, chair of the panel that wrote the report and professor of medicine, epidemiology, and international health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. \"While drinking water is a frequent choice for hydration, people also get water from juice, milk, coffee, tea, soda, fruits, vegetables, and other foods and beverages as well. Moreover, we concluded that on a daily basis, people get adequate amounts of water from normal drinking behavior -- consumption of beverages at meals and in other social situations -- and by letting their thirst guide them.\"  \n\nThe report did not specify exact requirements for water, but \n\nset general recommendations for women at approximately 2.7 liters (91 ounces) of total water - from all beverages and foods - each day, and men an average of approximately 3.7 liters (125 ounces daily) of total water. \n\nThe panel did not set an upper level for water.\nThey also stated that caffeinated beverages counted towards fluid requirements:\n\nAbout 80 percent of people's total water intake comes from drinking water and beverages -- including caffeinated beverages -- and the other 20 percent is derived from food.\n\nHow will drinking even more water than necessary benefit people? Many ways. Here are a few that I can think of:\n\nDecreased food intake: drinking a glass of water half an hour before a meal has been shown to slightly decrease the amount of food a person will eat without any distractions.\nDecreased spending on high-calorie drinks: drinking water decreases thirst. Maybe the decrease is enough to discourage reaching for unnecessarily high-calorie beverages. Unfortunately water doesn't taste as good as sugary beverages. :(\nIncreased cardiovascular health: drinking excess water, then using a bathroom several flights up or down from the floor people work on (walking, not using the elevator) will promote a bit of decent exercise several times/day.\nIncreased spiritual well being: Before drinking, meditating for a few minutes (think about life without clean water to drink, to bathe in, to launder clothes, etc.; imagining a drought seriously impacting people, then thinking about water available for drinking) and experiencing gratitude for the gift of it is beneficial. Gratitude has been shown in many studies to increase happiness.\n\nThere are medical conditions wherein drinking more than as guided by thirst is recommended, but that is a different question.\n\u201cDrink at least eight glasses of water a day.\u201d Really?

It was believed that a diet high in vegetables and fruit probably decreased breast cancer risk and that a diet high in total fat possibly increased risk. That belief was put to the test in the WHEL study.\nThe study subjects were previously treated early stage breast cancer. These women had been treated for breast cancer, that is, they were not only diagnosed, but had followed all the recommendations for breast cancer treatment at the time. This was a group for which there was high hope.\nThe diet was very intensive, very high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and low in fat. Blood tests confirmed that the women were indeed on the diet. Unfortunately, no difference in breast cancer recurrence or death from breast cancer was found.\n\nIn conclusion, during a mean 7.3-year follow-up, we found no evidence that adoption of a dietary pattern very high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and low in fat vs a 5-a-day fruit and vegetable diet prevents breast cancer recurrence or death among women with previously treated early stage breast cancer.\n\nIf hair loss is a major concern to your mother, please let her know that some patients have responded very favorably to \"scalp cooling\" during chemotherapy.

Some viruses, like influenza, have genomes that are very conducive to swapping between strains. This is known as antigenic shift. Other viruses, like HIV, have relatively rapid evolution brought on by methods of copying their genomes that are \"sloppy\" or error prone. This is sometimes called antigenic drift (influenza does this as well).\nBoth of these mechanisms make it likely that, over time, the difference between the vaccine and the virus is such that your body will no longer recognize one as the other.\nIn contrast to RNA viruses like HIV and influenza, viruses that have their genomes stored as double stranded DNA, like smallpox, have much lower error rates, which means antigenic drift is less of a problem, and it's not prone to antigenic shift. This means that a vaccine developed against it wasn't made ineffective by the virus evolving such that it didn't provoke an immune response (known as antigenic escape).\nThis stability made smallpox an excellent target for a vaccine, and the lack of stability is why developing a long-lasting vaccine against influenza and HIV is so difficult.\n"}
